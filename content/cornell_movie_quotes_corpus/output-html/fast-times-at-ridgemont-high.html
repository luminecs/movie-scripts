<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: I think he looks like Richard Gere.</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: I think he looks like… Richard
Gere.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Did you see his cute little butt?</p>
<p><strong>waitress #2</strong>: Let’s talk about C-19.</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1 and linda</strong>: We were!</p>
<p><strong>waitress #2</strong>: I think I’ll drop over and change the
shakers.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No, be cool, that’s Stacy’s section.</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: He’s too old for Stacy, she hasn’t even
started high school yet.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How’s it going.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you think that guy’s cute?</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: In a blow-dryed kind of way.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Does anyone else want to take his table?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Don’t you like him?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Come on, Stacy, it’s your section and your
man.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just take his order, look him in the eye and
if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: So you working hard or hardly working?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You look like you could still be in high
school.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I know, everyone says that.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What can I get for you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: How about your phone number?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Do you ever look at those girls who work at
Swenson’s? They’re beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch
them six nights a week.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You should work for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What can I do for you, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #1</strong>: You the guy with the Van Halen
tickets?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I could be.</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #2</strong>: What do you want for something
in the first ten rows?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Twenty bucks apiece.</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #1</strong>: Those tickets were only twelve
fifty!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: So don’t buy ’em.</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #2</strong>: All the other scalpers are sold
out, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Scalper? You call me a scalper? I perform a
service, my friends. The service costs money. Now do you want the
tickets or not?</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #1</strong>: Are you sure you can’t go any
lower.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: These are my special back-to-school
prices.</p>
<p><strong>junior high kid #2</strong>: We’ll take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey Brad! I waited till you came on! I
wanted your fries.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: We need fifteen Superstars, David!</p>
<p><strong>fellow employee #1</strong>: Okay, Brad!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’ll take care of the fry orders! Just get me
the Superstars!</p>
<p><strong>fellow employee #2</strong>: Fish sandwiches!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey you guys! You had shirts on when you came
in here.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Something happened to them, mon.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Come on, Spicoli. Why don’t you just put your
shirts back on? See the sign?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Any problems?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts
on. I took care of it, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Did you throw away those fries,
Hamilton?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: They were left over from the last shift.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.
Perfectly good.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: But they weren’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He gave me his card. ‘Ron Johnson, Audio
Consultant.’</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Should we buy a frame for that?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Come on, Linda, I haven’t had a boyfriend all
summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life
would change… Do you think he’ll call this week?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys?
I’ll tell you. They’re mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after
every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they’d get
the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don’t call.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy
and I wanted to sit closer, I’d sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I’d
just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Face it. With some guys you have to make the
first move. A lot of guys are just… wussies.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy, what are you waiting for? You’re
fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It’s no huge thing. It’s just
sex. If you don’t, one of the other girls will.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He was hot, wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If I didn’t have a fiance in Chicago, I’d go
for it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Are you Linda Barrett?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m Carrie Frazier from Toys ’R Us. Judy
Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I have this situation with my boyfriend, and I
wanted to…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Okay, are you over sixteen?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All right, what you want to do is go to the
Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly - several
times a week – and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty’s.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: And they don’t call my parents?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Not if you’re over sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: And don’t let them talk you into a diaphragm
either.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can’t believe I start high school
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Believe it.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #1</strong>: Hamilton!</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: The cruising vessel! Hey – Yooooo!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Six more payments, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: See that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave Charles
Jefferson that car when he was a sophomore.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: How ya doing! That car looks great,
Charles!</p>
<p><strong>jefferson</strong>: Don’t… fuck… with… it.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Shit, that’s my man.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Brad, can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Arnold. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Brad, I really fuckin’ hate McDonald’s, man.
Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went
downhill.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You want to work at Carl’s?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Oh, man, if you could swing something there,
I’d do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I can probably get you in there. Just let me
talk to Dennis Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: All right!!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Sis.</p>
<p><strong>brad’s buddies</strong>: Hey, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi… Where’s Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How
should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister
goes to the same high school. The party’s over. So who do you have first
period?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: U.S. History. Mr. Hand.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey-yo.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey-yoooooooooo.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s wrong with Mr. Hand?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Nothing… if you like ‘Hawaii Five O.’ You
better get in class, Stacy. That’s not the one to be late to.</p>
<p><strong>rich</strong>: Your sister is really turning into a fox.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You should see her in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>brad’s buddies</strong>: Hey-yooooooooooo.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I have but one question for you on our
first morning ‘together.’ Can you attend my class? Pakalo?… Understand?…
History has proven us one basic fact. Man does not do anything that is
not for his own good. It is for your own good that you attend my class.
And if you can’t make it… I can make you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: We have a twenty-question quiz every
Friday. It will cover all the material we’ve dealt with during the week.
There will be no make-up exams. It’s important that you all have your
Land of Truth and Liberty textbooks by Wednesday. At the latest.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Your grade is the average of all your
quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third. Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Also. There will be no eating in this
class. You get used to doing your own business on your own time. That’s
one demand I make. I don’t like staying after class with you on
detention. That’s my time. I don’t like wasting it. Just like you
wouldn’t want me to come to your house some evening and discuss U.S.
History on your time. Pakalo?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: That guy has been stoned since the third
grade.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Yeah. I’m registered for this class.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: What class?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: This is U.S. History, right? I saw the
globe in the window.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Oh, please. I get so lonely when that
third attendance bell rings and I don’t see all my kids here.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Sorry I’m late. This new schedule is
totally confusing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Mr. Spicoli?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: That’s the name they gave me.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You just ripped my card in two!</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, bud. What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: No problem at all. I think you know where
the front office is.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You… dick.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I’ve taken the time to print up a complete
schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover. Please pass them
back to the desks behind you…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You hear about the surfer in Mr. Hand’s
class?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Told Hand to fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>brad’s buddies</strong>: Whoa!_</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Thompson!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I hear Thompson got canned at Bob’s this
summer.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #1</strong>: Yeah. They hacked his hours, so he
quit.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>buddy #1</strong>: Making two eighty at Seven-Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Man. They make you wear a fuckin’ candy stripe
suit over there.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: Poor guy.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Poor guy.</p>
<p><strong>stoner buddy #1</strong>: It was so bitchin’, mon. Everybody
is talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>stoner buddy #2</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: The motherfucker pissed me off.</p>
<p><strong>stoner buddy #2</strong>: Totally. You don’t have to take
that shit.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I didn’t take that shit.</p>
<p><strong>stoner buddy #1</strong>: Tell us again. What happened after
he ripped up your ad card?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I called him a dick. And then I reached for
his class notes, and I ripped ‘em up. I said, ’Hey bud. Two can play
this game.’</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I’ll tell you this. If he hassles me again,
I can’t be responsible for what happens… you know why?</p>
<p><strong>stoner buddy #1</strong>: Because he’s a fuckin’ dick!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You got it. Gimme a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No way! He just called him a dick.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: God. People exaggerate so much at this
school.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hi, Linda. God, you look so great.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, you guys. This is Stacy. Stacy, this is
Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr.</p>
<p><strong>gregg and cindy</strong>: Hi, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If there’s one thing that never changes… it’s
a cheerleader.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Linda. That girl looks just like Pat
Benatar.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Actually, there are three girls at Ridgemont
who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: None of them talk to each other.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you think guys find that attractive?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You’re much
prettier than them.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You’d
probably think they’d be better in bed.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you mean ‘better in bed.’ You either
do it or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No there are variables that, like, I might
not be good at.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What variables?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Like, you know, giving blow jobs.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Well I never did it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s nothing to it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You just have to practice a little first.
Relax these muscles. Think of your throat as an open tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What happens… don’t laugh at me, but when a
guy has an orgasm… you know, like, how much comes out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just kidding. About 10cc.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh! That’s where that group got its name
from.</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: I’ll tell you right now. I’m not
going. I’ll get sick or something. I’m not going into a room with a
bunch of dead guys.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: You’ll go. It’s part of the final.</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: Have you heard what they do? I’m
serious. Have you heard?</p>
<p><strong>boy student</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: The bodies are dissected, Mike, and
Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>boy student</strong>: You mean he reaches in and pulls this
stuff out?</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boy student</strong>: Like a heart?</p>
<p><strong>girl student</strong>: Hearts, lungs, guts…</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Good day, everyone! I just switched to
Sanka. I’m running a little slow today, so have a heart.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sleep tight, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Good night, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks for picking me up.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: ‘The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.’ You
look nice tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks. So do you.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Where do you feel like going?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know. Wherever you want.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: How about the point?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: The point sounds fine.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: All right, the point it is.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: That’s a nice shirt.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Thanks. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: It’s very warm out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It is. It’s very warm. I wonder how long it
will last?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Are you really nineteen?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yes… I am really nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: I think I better take you home.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What about those other guys you live
with?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: No. I mean back to your home.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Is this your first time?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Was it great?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It was okay.</p>
<p><strong>i linda</strong>: You’ll always remember your first time.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It was nice.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it
serious?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Come on, Linda. It’s just sex.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey! That’s my line!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Mom says to clean up the pool.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Why can’t you do it?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed
it up.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Your friends use the pool too.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I take out the garbage.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Don’t strain yourself.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: They’re not home yet.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad, what would you say if I asked you to
just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid
of them at work?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’d say… who the hell is Ron Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’ll explain everything later.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: See that moustache coming in, Rat?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: See? You can almost press it out.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I am in love.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You… are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: What do you mean – wuss? This girl is my
exact type. It’s her. Definitely her.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: It’s definitely your mama.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Damone, you gotta listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: All right… where did you see her?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: She’s in my biology class.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Did you get her number?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Did you get her name?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: No. It’s too soon.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: It’s never too soon! Girls decide how far to
let you go in the first five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to
this strange girl in my biology class and say, ‘Hello! I’d like you to
take your clothes off and jump on me?’</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I would. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I can see it all now. This is going to be
just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You
bought forty bucks of fuckin’ film and you never even talked to her.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You tell me, Mike. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Okay. Okay. Here’s what you do.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You start from the second you walk into
biology. Don’t just walk… move across the room.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Don’t talk to her. Let her know. Use your
face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out
the vibe and I have personally found that… girls do respond. Something
happens.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Of course something happens. You put the
vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something’s gonna
happen.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: That’s the idea, Rat. That’s The
Attitude.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that
you don’t care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens,
your toes are still tappin’. When you are the cruelest and the coolest…
then you have The Attitude.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Were those flowers really for me, Brad?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: How much did they cost?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Let’s go to the Point tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What’s there to do at the Point?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What’s there to do at the Point? God, Lisa,
we’ve been going together almost two years, and…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Brad. I don’t want to have to use sex as a
tool.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Tool? Tool for what? We’ve been going together
almost two years!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it here, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hamilton! You have fifteen double cheese to
box!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Who sent the
flowers?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s just some guy I met at Swenson’s. You
don’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t care it you tell me or not. I got
problems of my own.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Is everything okay at work?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at
work. I don’t even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You’re going to break up with Lisa, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’ve been doing some thinking. It’s my last
school year. I’m a single, successful guy. I think I want my
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Why? Because she won’t sleep with you?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Where did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m just guessing.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well… it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe you just need to give her some time.
She’s so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa.
But everybody doesn’t have to be her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know. I was just curious.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Maybe yes. Maybe no.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You are a virgin!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But your face did!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Are you still a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Maybe yes. Maybe no.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t give me that shit! I know you’re still a
virgin!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: There… There’s his car. I know he’s at work
tonight. He hasn’t come into Swenson’s since he called my house. My
mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was
nineteen. I guess I should tell him I’m fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Don’t you dare, you’ll never hear from him
again.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Does Doug care that you’re seventeen?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the
person inside is like. That’s why I’m marrying him.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: If he ever calls again I’ll say I’m
eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Boy I am so glad to be through with all these
games.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: C… D… F… F… F… three weeks we’ve been
talking about the Platt Amendment. What are you people? On dope? A piece
of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt. It
was passed in 1906. This amendment to our Constitution has a profound
impact upon all of our daily liv….</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Where is Jeff Spicoli?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I saw him earlier today near the 200
Building bathrooms. Is he still on campus?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Yes, Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: I saw him by the food machines.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>desmond</strong>: Just before class, sir…</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Okay. Bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: What is this fascination with truancy?
What is it that gets inside your heads?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: There are other teachers in this school
who look the other way at truants. It’s a little game that you both
play. They pretend they don’t see you, you pretend you don’t ditch. Who
pays the price later? You.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey! Wait a minute! There’s no birthday
party for me here!</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Thank you, Desmond. What’s the reason for
your truancy?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I couldn’t make it in time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: You mean, you couldn’t? Or you
wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I don’t know, mon. The food lines took
forever.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Food will be eaten on your time! Why are
you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you
shamelessly waste my time like this?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Don’t you like that, Miss Hamilton?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I really like that too. ‘I don’t know’…
that’s nice. ‘Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?’ ‘Gee, Mr. Spicoli, I
don’t know’. I like that. I think I’m going to leave your words on this
board for all my classes to enjoy. Giving you full credit, of course,
Mr. Spicoli.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’ve got to get used to working Christmas.
People are always screaming and yelling… then they get home and they’re
all Christmasy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I think Christmas brings out the worst in
people.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I guess Ron hasn’t called yet.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Not since November.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy, it doesn’t look good for the
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Don’t you think it meant anything to him.
Even if I am fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy. What does it matter? He’s a stereo
salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You
want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he’s still got that
little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I should quit this job. I’m going to get so
fat working here… nobody will ever take me out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you?
You are really going to be beautiful… someday.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey – Ron Johnson? It’s his loss.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: The business is changing, Rat. I’ll tell
you, these kids today… they don’t even listen to Aerosmith.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln
now.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: There used to be three or four of those
guys. Now we see ’em every time we come to the mall.</p>
<p><strong>customer #1</strong>: Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of Blue
Oyster Cult tickets last time around. I was this close to working at
7-11. No Cult.</p>
<p><strong>jefferson</strong>: When is Earth, Wind and Fire coming?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I’m really not sure. I haven’t heard
anything yet, but I’ll let you know the second there is the slightest
news, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jefferson</strong>: I’m taking my little brother.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Excellent. So that will be two tickets… All
right. Fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>customer #2</strong>: Wow. He really lives here. I thought he
just flew in for the football games.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Shit, he’s my man. He knows where to come
for tickets.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Well, Rat. Are you ready for the moment of
truth?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: She is immune to my charms.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hey, Rat.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Ace the jacket.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi. May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Yes. I have two questions. I was
curious…</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: What do you do with the jackets people
leave here?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We keep them.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You keep them.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We keep them, in case the people come
back.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Here they are. You can look through it, if
you want.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: It’s cool. It would take too much time to
go through all that stuff. I’ll just pick up a new one.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s your other question?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: My other question is… can-I-have
your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you have a pen? This one’s out of ink.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Oh… yes.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My name is
Mark Ratner.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Lisa? I have something to tell you. Look, I’m
a senior now. I’m a single, successful guy and I’ve got to be fair to
myself. Lisa… I think I need my freedom.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Aw, don’t do that… don’t take it personally,
okay? Please? I knew you’d understand, because…</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Brad! I know you’re on your break, but would
you cover me on register three?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let’s
go. Play ball.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Yes. This is not the best breakfast I
ever ate.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: And I want my money back.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, I believe you have to fill out a form.
There’s a pad right around here.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: No. I want my money back right now.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, that’s not the way it works, really. And
you ate most of your food already, too…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: See that sign? It says 100% Money Back
Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word ‘guarantee’? Do they
teach you that here? Give me my money back.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I can’t do that. But if you wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Look. Just put your little hand back in
the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay? Please, Brad?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms
here.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing
with morons. How hard is it to…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Mister, if you don’t shut up, I’m gonna kick
100% of your ass.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Manager!!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Can I help you, sir? Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: You bet there’s a problem! Your
employee used profanity and threatened me with violence! I’m shocked,
frankly. I’ve eaten here many times and I’ve always enjoyed the service
– until today!</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: All I wanted was my money back for this
breakfast. It was a little undercooked. And this young man threatened
me. Now I plan to write a letter! I plan to…</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Did you threaten this man or use profanity
in any way?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: He insulted me first. He called me a
moron.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Did you threaten this customer or use
profanity in any way?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m very sorry this happened to you,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold.</p>
<p><strong>merv griffin</strong>: Will you please give a warm welcome
to… Jeff Spicoli!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: ‘Layin’ ladies! Drinkin’ wine! You gotta
dollar – You’re a friend of mine! Gettin’ loose! Feelin’ fine! You and
me – It’s get down time! We’re on the Highway to Hell! The Highway to
Hell!’</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel
great.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: I was going to say… your eyes look a little
red.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I’ve been swimming, Merv.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was
thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: I wanted to talk a little bit about school,
if I could…</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: School. School is no problem. All you have
to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have
to do is go about half the time.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: How often do you go?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I don’t go at all.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do
you want to set it up for us?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Well, it pretty much speaks for itself.
Peter, you want to run with it?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Merv, this is the action down at Sunset
Cliffs at about six in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: That’s me, Merv.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: Are you going to ride that wave?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>griffin</strong>: What’s going through your mind right here,
Jeff? The danger of it all?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Merv, I’m thinking… I’ve only got about
four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior
high start showing up with their boogie boards.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Dad says you have to get up!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Dad says you’re late again, you
butthole!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Dad says!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Daaaaaaaad! Jeff threw a snorkel at
me!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I just want to say that we are not ‘Spirit
Bunnies’ anymore. We always hated that name. It bugged the heck out of
Dina and me…</p>
<p><strong>dina</strong>: It’s just such a put down.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: They don’t call the Chess Club ‘Checker
Champs’ or anything like that. We’re going to go to everything this
year, you guys. We’re going to go to soccer, wrestling, basketball…
everything. We know you’ve got a lot of spirit! Everybody – riiiiiight?
And we’re gonna destroy Lincoln next week? Riiiiiiight?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Man, I don’t even want to see those guys from
Carl’s again.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If you’d apologize I think Dennis would take
you back.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis
Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m just glad we’re still together, Lisa,
because I need you this year.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look, Brad, I’ve been trying to think of a way
to tell you this. We’re almost out of high school, this is our last
year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new
people. Then, if we get back together, we’ll know it’s the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But I still want to be friends.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: We’re going to be going to every game this
year. We just want the crowd to participate and we want spirit from
every little person in this entire school. Allll-Riiiight?</p>
<p><strong>connors</strong>: Well, thank you, girls. People, don’t
forget, the big game is one week away. We’ll see everybody back here on
Monday and have a good weekend.</p>
<p><strong>arnaz</strong>: Driving ess an important part of each and
every one of our da-ily lives. Ees a responsibility like no o-ther and
ess a matter of life and…</p>
<p><strong>arnaz</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><strong>arnaz</strong>: They have foun’… The Braking Point.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What do you think of that guy who works at
the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just watch out if he pulls up in a van, and
then puts on a Led Zeppelin tape.</p>
<p><strong>arnaz</strong>: The driver here has had jus’ two drinks. Two
drinks at the home of a frien’.</p>
<p><strong>student #1</strong>: He’s fucked-up, Ricky!</p>
<p><strong>student #2</strong>: They guys a drunk, Ricky!</p>
<p><strong>arnaz</strong>: And although this driver thinks he ees
drivin’ well, he may be ‘doing okay, but he forgets to per-ceive what
ees real goin’ on…</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Be noble. Be aggressive. The thing about
Missile Command is to decimate before you can be decimated. Just like in
real life.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Check it out, Rat. The Surf Nazis… out for a
Sunday stroll.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: What do I say after she gets in the
car?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: No problem, Rat. What you need is my special
Five Point Plan.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What do you mean? Men have died trying to
obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Okay. Tell me. What’s the Five Point
Plan?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: All right. Pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: First of all, Rat… never let on how much you
like a girl.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Oh. Hi. Two. Always call the shots.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Kiss me. Three. Act like wherever you are,
that’s the place to be. Isn’t this great? Four. When ordering food, find
out what she wants and then order for both of you… it’s a classy move.
And the lady will have… Five. And this is most important. When you get
down to making out, whenever possible, put on the first side of Led
Zeppelin IV. Why don’t you put this tape on? It sounds great in the back
of my van… why don’t we listen from there?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat.
Voila. You can’t miss.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I think I’ve got it. Once I get going, I’ll
be okay. But… how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You wuss. It’s no problem. One person says
something to the other and that’s how it starts…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks for coming to get me.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is a nice car.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Yeah. It’s my sister’s.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you have Mrs. George for English?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Yeah. She is pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah. She is pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty
good restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’ve heard that, too.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Do you know what you want?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I think I’ll have the Seafood Salad
Special.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Do you mind if I excuse myself for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Are you ready to order here?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Well… sure. She will have the Seafood Salad
Special. And I will have… the same.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Anything to drink?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Two Cokes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Yo.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Damone. It’s Mark.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Mark. What happened to your date?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: It’s happening right now. I’m here at the
Atlantis. Everything’s fine except… I left my wallet at home.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Did you go home and get it?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: No. It’s too late. The food is coming and
everything. Damone, I’ve got to ask you this favor, and I’ll never ask
you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please
borrow your mom’s car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back
here?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Damone, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I’m really pretty busy…</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You owe me for this one.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Are you sure there’s nothing else I can
bring you?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I’ll have one more Coke… Do you want
another Coke, Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sure. I’ll… have another Coke.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Two more Cokes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Two… more… Cokes.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hey, Mark. Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Damone! You come here?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I come for the seafood. It’s great! Hey… you
know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it
back?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Wow. I’ve been looking for that thing! Hey,
Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Well, I’ve gotta be running.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Okay. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Nice to meet you, Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I had a really nice time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Me, too. I’m real sorry someone broke in and
stole your tape deck.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I never thought it would happen at The
Atlantis. Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you want to come inside?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Aren’t your parents asleep?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No, they’re away for the weekend. Brad and I
are watching the house.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Okay. Sure. I’ll come in.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Where’s your brother?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know. Probably out. Want something to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: No. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Well, I’m going to change real quick. I hope
you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Naw. I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Will you unzip me?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You can come in, if you want!</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: So… pretty nice house you’ve got here.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks. So… What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a
lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid,
right?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have
Mr. Deegan?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Look, Stacy, I want you to know that…</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: … I’ve got to go home.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you really have to go?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Well… it’s getting kind of late.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I guess it is getting late, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You blew it, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: Hey, slow down. This is my brother’s car.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I thought he was out of town.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Then don’t hassle it.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: Seen the new Playboy?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Naw. Any good?</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: Suzanne Somers’ tits.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: I like sex.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hold your beer down, L.C., I think it’s a
cop.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: This is a cop. He’s definitely cruising me
at busting distance.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: What the fuck is this guy doing?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: What the fuck is this guy doing?</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: This ain’t no cop.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: Hey! He’s gonna scratch my brother’s car!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: It’s a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: They’re fuckin’ with us.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: My brother’s car!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: All right. Die, Granada Jocks!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Would you roll your window up, L.C.? It’s
messing my hair.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: We just missed the turnoff to the party.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You know the thing I love about Mustangs?
The steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you
can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>granada jocks</strong>: Fuck youuuuuuuuuu!</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: My brother is going to kill us. He’s gonna
kill you and then he’s gonna kill me. He’s gonna kill us.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Just be glad you’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: My brother is gonna shit.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is
he gonna kill us?</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: First he’s gonna shit. And then he’s gonna
kill us..</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Will you just relax, mon? He’s not gonna
kill us. My father is a television repairman. He’s got all kinds of
tools. I can fix-this car.</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: You can’t fix this car, Spicoli.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I can fix it.</p>
<p><strong>student #1</strong>: Hey, Brad! How’s going?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>student #2</strong>: Where you working?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Fish and chips place.</p>
<p><strong>student #1</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just a fish and chips place.</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: We’ll be seeing you, Brad!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I think we may have gotten away clean.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I sent a letter to Doug today. I’ll be so
glad when he gets out here.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You really ought to look at this, Linda.
There’s a drawing on every page… and all these quizzes. It’s like
school.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why don’t you put your mother’s secret book
back?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Listen to this… ‘What are your mate’s three
most erogenous zones?’</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Okay, penis, that’s one, balls…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Wouldn’t penis and balls be the same
category?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re right. Probably penis, mouth and
neck.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: All right! Here’s another one. ‘The most
satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax
first, you and your mate climax together?’</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Climax together.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Does that ever happen?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No. But it’s a nice idea.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Listen to this … it says ‘Most women derive
pleasure from sex, but they don’t have real orgasms.’</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well… they obviously don’t know about
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: How long does Doug take?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t know. Thirty to forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s Doug do in Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He works for the airline. He’ll be out here.
You’ll meet him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s no high school boy.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hey! We came over to help you with Math
homework!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Really. We figured you needed the help. On
such a hot day.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I think they’re both virgins.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I didn’t ask for any help. Did you,
Linda?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Well, that’s exactly why I brought some Wisk
for the jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you
have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hey, Linda! I’ll judge your dive. I’m a
champion diver myself.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Does Mom know you have company?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s just Linda. And Mark from school.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hi, Linda.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, you guys, keep it down. I’ve got some
work to do upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: God, he hardly even talks anymore.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I know. He hates to have to wear
uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Poor guy.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Why don’t you get up and do a dive,
Mike?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: No. I don’t think so. Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Chicken!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy! I’ve got water in my ears. Do you have
any Q-Tips?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: God, I don’t think so. Better look in the
house.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hi, Brad. You know how cute I always thought
you were. I think you’re so sexy. Will you come to me?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey, Brad! Do you have any Q-Ti…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Wait just a… minute.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know anybody was in here.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Doesn’t anybody fuckin’ knock anymore?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Now in 1898, Spain owned Cuba. Outright.
Think about it. Cuba, owned by a disorganized parliament 4,000 miles
away. Cubans were in a constant state of revolt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: In 1904, the United States decided to
throw a little weight around, and…</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Pizza.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Pizza, sir!</p>
<p><strong>pizza man</strong>: Okay, who had the double cheese sausage
and bologna?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: For you, my man.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the
hell do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Learning about Cuba. Having some food.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Mr. Spicoli, you’re on dangerous ground
here. You’re causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I’ve been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If
I’m here… and you’re here… doesn’t that make it our time?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: So I thought I’d order us a pizza. Just
leave me a lot of bologna…</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: There’s the pizza.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Totally!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You better save some for me, you swine!</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: And you, my friend. I’ll see you for a
two-hour detention every afternoon this week.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Why aren’t you in school, son?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I go to school in the mornings. I have a work
study program for the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: $8.46, please.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Here you go. I have it exactly. Good
luck!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Thank you, and thanks for coming to Captain
Kidd.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hamilton! I’ll take over the fryer. Those
boys at IBM need some Catch of-the-Day boxes, and I told them you would
personally deliver them within the hour. I’ll reimburse you for gas.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just write me out a bill.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Hamilton, come over here. What is that
you’ve got on?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: This is how I dress all the time.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: But you took off your Captain Kidd
uniform.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I thought I’d take it off for the drive over
to IBM. It’s kind of uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Come on, Hamilton. You’re going over there
to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over
Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our
uniforms. You know that!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You really want me to put all this stuff back
on?</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Yes. I think so. Show some pride,
Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t believe you’re asking me to do this,
but okay.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can’t wait until I can drive next year. I
walk every day. It’s such a drag.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Get a ride with somebody.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But
he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What a guy.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You
like him?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mark is a really nice boy…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But I think I like you.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you want to come in for a second?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Do you have any ice tea?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sure. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I guess the annuals are coming in pretty
soon. Are you going to get one?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Aren’t you curious to see how your class
picture turned out?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I know what I look like.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Do you want to take a quick swim?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow…
I’m going to my room to change!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: This is great ice tea!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You don’t have to shout! You can come back
here to my room!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Come with me! I know there’s a suit in the
changing room!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Pick a suit.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I don’t know. It’s getting pretty late…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Are you really a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s okay if it’s your first time.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because
Mark really likes you, and he’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: He’s my friend, too.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You’re a really good kisser.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: So are you. Are you shaking?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: No. Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Why don’t you take off your clothes,
Mike?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: How about both of us at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I want you to know that it’s your final
decision if we should continue or not.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Let’s continue.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I think we’re making a lot of noise.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I think I came. Didn’t you feel it?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I’ve got to get home. I’ve really got to go,
Stacy.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Where’s Mike today?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Today’s April 16th. Damone never comes to
school on April 16th.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What’s April 16th?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: It’s John Bonham’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: John Bonham?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin.
He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays
everything John Bonham ever recorded. It’s like his own holiday.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Oh. I see.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’rourke</strong>: Have a seat, Brad… Brad have you got
your list of college applications?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, to tell you the truth Mrs. O’Rourke,
I’ve kind of been putting it off. I’m not sure what I want to do
yet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’rourke</strong>: All right Brad. Let me ask you like
this. If I were queen of the world, and I could make you whatever you
wanted to be, what would it be?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I don’t know… Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’rourke</strong>: I realize it’s important to have fun
in your senior year, with your friends, but there comes a time when you
have to get serious about your future, think about college, and put
aside all this fun.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You know what, Mrs. O’Rourke? I broke up with
my girlfriend this year. I lost my job at Carl’s, and two other places.
I wake up at 5:30 to work at 7-11, then I go to school, then I go back
to 7-11. I have to pay rent, you know. My grades haven’t been that bad,
and now you’re telling me that the fun is over. Well, I’m still waiting
for the fun to start.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. o’rourke</strong>: Brad, I’ll see you when I’m through
with the rest of the seniors. If you want to visit the career office, go
right ahead. I’ll talk to you when you’re more prepared.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. oirourke</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Hi-yeeeeeeee!!!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi Mike!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Oh. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I didn’t see you this morning.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Look, I’m kind of in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m in a hurry too. I just thought I could
say hi to you.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Today we’re going to explore how this
hospital works to preserve human life. We’ll be visiting every floor,
every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us, in
life… and in death.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Over thirty children are delivered here
each day…</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: This is part of your third quarter exam,
and I’d advise you to take careful notes on what we’re about to see.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: May I just ask you one last time to
conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity…</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: As you know, all the bodies in this room
are recently deceased human bio-structures.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Yes, Randy?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Who are these guys?</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Most of them were derelicts, Randy. They
sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money.
Something like thirty dollars, I believe. Isn’t that right, Doctor
Miller?</p>
<p><strong>dr. miller</strong>: Twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Twenty-five bucks is pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Now this gentleman here is named Arthur.
Arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to
view his body in its pristine state.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: This incision allows us to pull aside
the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human
organs as they exist in their natural state.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: I want all of you to take a look at the
chest cavity for just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. vargas</strong>: Here we have the human lungs and heart,
which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I made a fool of myself.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Nobody noticed. Don’t worry about it. We’ll
just stay out here until everyone comes out, we’ll blend back in.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What about the notes?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I’ll get you the notes.</p>
<p><strong>montalban</strong>: You see, Tatoo, what this man doesn’t
realize is that he must one day leave Fantasy Island. And he must
continue his life as an incurable leper.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah… you’re kidding… What did he say… What
did you say… How much did it cost? Look, tell him he can have a
relationship with you or a ‘more open’ relationship with someone else…
Listen, Debbie, can I call you later. I’m waiting for Doug to call.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll bet he forgets to call again.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: God, Stacy, it’s not that sad. It’s just
David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know, I’m just so depressed.
Everything is just so… depressing.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You have been acting very strange the last
few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I don’t know… I just don’t feel right.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: What do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It couldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the
clinic. I’ll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron
Johnson, you’d be out to here!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m not going to tell him. He’s an asshole. I
hate him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But it costs money to have an abortion. Even
at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It’s the least he can
do. It’s the guy’s responsibility too.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You know, there’s one thing you didn’t tell
me about guys.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You didn’t tell me that they can be so nice,
so great… but then you sleep with them and they start acting like
they’re five years old.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re right. I didn’t tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mike, there’s something that’s been on my
mind and I have to tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What? Now?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Why don’t you call me up tonight?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mike. I want you to know that I’m
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: How do you know it’s mine? We only did it
once.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I know it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You made me do it! You locked the door. You
made me do it! You wanted it more than me!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Take that back.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: All right, I take it back.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: There’s only one thing we can do. We’ve got
to get rid of it. We’ve got to get an abortion.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: We’ve got to get an abortion?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one
once.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: It’s already planned, Mike. It’s going to
cost $150 at the Free Clinic.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Doesn’t sound free to me. So you want me to
pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride
to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hello… is Mike there?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: He says he’s helping his father in the
garage and he’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barrett</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. barrett</strong>: She went off to the beach. She’ll be
back later, though.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad! Hey, wait a second!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to
do.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate
it.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: This is going to prick a little.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Now scoot over here.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hello, Stacy, I’m Doctor Bartell.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Any questions before we begin?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: This is going to hurt, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We’ll use a local but you’ll feel some
pressure. It doesn’t last that long.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Does it hurt more to have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes… but I think you mind it less.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: How are we doing in here? Debbie, ready to
leave?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Right through here. Stacy, I can’t let you go
unless you have a ride home.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Uh, my boyfriend said held be waiting
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Since when do you shop at the Flea Market
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Brad. Please don’t tell Mom and Dad…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You’re not going to tell me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: All right, then. It’s your secret.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I really thought he would show up. I waited…
and waited… and waited…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That little prick.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Then I called his house, and his mother told
me he was in the garage helping his father.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That little prick.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I paid for it and everything.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There goes your stereo for another year. Mike
Damone is a no-brain little prick. I’m not letting him get away with
this.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Don’t do anything, Linda. I’d rather just
forget about it. I don’t even like the guy.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stacy, he’s not a guy. He’s a little
prick!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Shhhhhhhhhit.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Hi, Mike!</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Hi, mike!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Hi… girls.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Damone? What happened between you and
Stacy?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Let me tell you something, Rat. Sometimes
girls just go haywire. It was a month ago, I’ve been trying to think of
a way to tell you ever since. We started messing around and… … something
happened. It’s all over with. It’s no big deal. I never called her
again.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: If you ask me, she’s pretty aggressive. You
understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: No Damone. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: She wasn’t really your girlfriend
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Hey fuck you Damone. There’s a lot of girls
out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to
prove?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Jesus. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: I always stick up for you. Whenever people
say ‘Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth’ – and they say that a lot – I say
‘You just don’t know Damone.’ When someone says you’re an idiot, I tell
them ‘Damone’s not an idiot. You just don’t know him.’ Well, you know,
Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I’m just finding
out.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Fine. Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: All right, Rat. You want to do something
about it?</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Well come on.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You come on.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: No. You come on, you wuss.</p>
<p><strong>sexton</strong>: Hey! Knock this crap off!!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, mon, can I use the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Go ahead. Just make it quick.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s the first door on your left.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I can’t find it, mon!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s the first door on your left!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: On the ledge?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: First door on your left!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: I want money. And I want it all – now.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: They empty and close the big safe here at
midnight.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: I know this store. I know where the safe
is.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Over there behind the donut case. Now
move!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m instructed to tell you that we are on a
video alarm system and there are other hidden cameras in the store …</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Just give me the money. Move it.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Okay. I just started here, and they just
taught me the procedure. I’ll give you the money, just let me figure
this out.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Move it. Move it.</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Let’s go, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You motherfucker. Get off my fuckin’ case.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: No towels, mon…</p>
<p><strong>robber</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: There goes your ride home.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Awesome. Totally awesome.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Another summer of working at Swenson’s.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Come on. There’s lots of men around here.
Keep your eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: You know, Linda. I’ve finally figured it out.
It’s not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I want romance.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Romance in Ridgemont? We don’t even get cable
TV.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Mike! You have a mess on C-9!</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8.
Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Get going.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I… am… so… wasted, mon. What is in this
shit? Doesn’t that stuff cause brain damage? Bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as soon as
school is out. Two more weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday. I am gonna take
both boards, my duck feet, many cases of beer, and just jam. No, mon,
from school. I’m leaving as soon as school gets out. I’ll be at Sunset
Cliffs by nighttime. Totally. Later.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Jeff you have company!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Go away, Curtis. If you can’t knock, I
can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: That’s better. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Mr… Mr. Hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: That’s right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Were you going somewhere tonight,
Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It’s
the last school event of the year.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I’m afraid we’ve got some things to
discuss here, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Do you want to sit there, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: I don’t know. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I’ll
use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago,
and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year – I
don’t like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention
cases. I’d rather be preparing the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: According to my calculations, Mr. Spicoli,
you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year. And rest assured
that is a kind estimate.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for
me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you
and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all
the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now
if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, it’s in my locker, Mr. Hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Well, then, I’m glad I remembered to bring
an extra copy just for you.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: … so, like, when Jefferson went before the
people what he was saying was ‘Hey, we left this place in England
because it was bogus, and if we don’t come up with some cool rules
ourself, we’ll be bogus, too!’ Right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Very close, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: I think I’ve made my point with you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a
question?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy
to… I don’t know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Well, you’ll find out next year.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I
ain’t even coming over to your side of the building.</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: If you graduate.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: You’re gonna flunk me?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Don’t worry, Spicoli. You’ll probably
squeak by.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: All right! Oh, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Aloha, Mr. Hand!</p>
<p><strong>mr. hand</strong>: Aloha, Spicoli.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Where’s Doug?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Not coming? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He says he’s got to stay in Chicago. He says
I should visit him sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Sometime?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, like maybe never.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: But what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Well I might go to Dartmouth.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Dartmouth?!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I didn’t tell anyone I applied cause I never
thought I’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I can’t believe it! But what about Doug?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s a world of guys out there. I just
wish I didn’t have to date any of them.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey – Doug Stallworth? It’s his loss.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Sign my annual, honey.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You’re losing it, Damone.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: You’re crazy. Those girls love me.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, mon. Sign my annual.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, mon, good thing we’re going to Mexico
this summer. ’Cause you’re gonna get kicked out of your house when your
parents read your annual.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I saw your picture in the paper. You had the
greatest look on your face!</p>
<p><strong>another student</strong>: Front of the Metro Section. I’m
telling my parents, ‘I know this guy, I know this guy.’</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Will you sign my annual, Brad?</p>
<p><strong>buddy #1</strong>: Fuckin’ manager of 7-11!</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: Get us jobs over there, Brad! You can do
it!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Since when do you guys want to work at
7-11?</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: Come on, Brad! It would be great! All of
us together!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Well, 7-11 is a tremendous operation. It’s
really changed, man. They’ve got great food, great magazines,
videogames… it’s class. Total class.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #3</strong>: As soon as you can get us in there, we’re
gone from Carl’s, Brad.</p>
<p><strong>buddy #2</strong>: Yeah, man, all the little punks from
junior high have taken over the place.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hamilton!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Easy, mon.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Summer, mon! We’re there!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Let’s roll, my man.</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, bud! Watch yourselff</p>
<p><strong>surf nazi</strong>: Are you Jeff Spicoli?</p>
<p><strong>l.c.</strong>: That’s him! He did it!</p>
<p><strong>spicoli</strong>: Hey, mon, I don’t know what your trip is,
but…</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hey Mark! Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Come over here!</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: You. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Hi, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Hi, Stacy. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’m fine. Mark, I’m so glad you came over
here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell
you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Yeah? About fifty people I didn’t know
wrote that in my annual.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I know everybody says it, but I really mean
it.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you
won’t forget what I look like. And so you’ll remember to call me over
the summer.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Well, I don’t know, I may be doing some
traveling this summer. I don’t know how much I’ll be around… But I’ll
give you a call sometime.</p>
<p><strong>stacy</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: She wants it, Rat.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: I saw you. You had pure Attitude.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: The Attitude, Damone, is only good until
you meet the right girl.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Whatever you say, Rat.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: And… you can only tell it’s the right girl
if you’re sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Sensitive – what is that?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Sensitive is when you can tell how people
feel without asking.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: So what makes you so sensitive?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Well, for one, I read. I don’t watch as
much television as you. I’m trying to feel things more. I’m learning a
lot about people.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: What do you read? What’s the last book you
read?</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: Lust For Life. It’s the story of Vincent
Van Gough.</p>
<p><strong>damone</strong>: Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean
I’m sensitive too.</p>
<p><strong>the rat</strong>: It’s a way, Damone. It’s a vibe. I put it
out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.</p>
