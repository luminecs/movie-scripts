<h1 id="alien-resurrection">alien-resurrection</h1>
<p><strong>ext. deep space silent black.</strong>: We sweep slowly
across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes into view:</p>
<p><strong>int. auriga</strong>: along the silent, empty corridors,
coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it.
Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold.</p>
<p><strong>int. medlab</strong>: Along a row of screens, where we see
the first signs of life readouts, lights, data – all shifting and
collating on the blinking screens.</p>
<p><strong>angle: wheat.</strong>: A birds eyes view of a field, the
soft golden waves filling the screen. Sharp contrast to what we have
seen before.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: My mom always said there were no
monsters – no, real ones – but there are.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab</strong>: Instruments show a jolt in heart rate,
blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>int. halllway</strong>: Tiny. dark, and we are moving through
it at impossible speed turning into another without slowing, up into an
air vent, still moving, moving until we reach a chamber, some place
where all we can see is a mass of dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes
us in, envelops us…</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: RIPLEY Lying somewhere, maybe the
dark-chamber – in the dream it keeps shifting. She opens her eyes, but
they are dark, whiteless.</p>
<p><strong>int. operating chamber</strong>: And the cause of this dream
becomes apparant:</p>
<p><strong>angle: ripley’s chest</strong>: being cut open with a
lasersaw.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Careful … ready with the amnio…</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: There she is…</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Well …</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: The host?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Sew her back up.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Well, that went as well as could be
expected–</p>
<p><strong>int. ripley’s cell</strong>: Sudden stillness.</p>
<p><strong>angle: above the cell</strong>: A guard stands on the floor
above, looking into the cell through the square of glass in the floor,
directly above Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>angle: ripley</strong>: She is still for a long while. Then
she lifts her hands, looking at them.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab</strong>: Ripley is sitting on a table as Gediman
draws blood from her.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: How’s our number Eight today?</p>
<p><strong>gediman:</strong>: Appears to be in good health…</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: How good?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Extraordinary. As in, completely off our
projected charts.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: This is from –</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: This is good. This is very good.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: I’d like to run some tests: strength,
coordination… We’re not looking at a normal cloning arc.</p>
<p><strong>wren:</strong>: Approved.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Well, it looks like you’re going to make us
all very proud.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: No! No! I’m all right!</p>
<p><strong>int. observation room</strong>: Wren and Gediman watch
through a one way mirror as a scientist tests Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>angle: ripley</strong>: The scientist is holding up cards
with pictures on them: house, dog, boat.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: It’s unprecedented.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Totally! She’s operating at a completely
adult capacity.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: And her memories?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: There are gaps. And there’s some degree of
cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: She’s freaked.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: “It” has some connective difficulties. A kind
of low level emotional autism.</p>
<p><strong>int hall - continuous</strong>: The two scientists follow,
pace him as he strides down towards a second observation room.</p>
<p><strong>gediman:</strong>: But the thing is, we can’t terminate her.
It.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: You haven’t told me what you think has caused
this.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: There’s been cases..</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Well, we don’t have nearly enough data… but in
some cases there is a collective memory passed down generationally. At a
genetic level. Like instinct, only more complex structurally.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: In some cases. You’re talking about the
alien.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: You promised me there wasn’t going to be any
crossing.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: It’s not like the other ones..</p>
<p><strong>int. observation room two</strong>: Darker than the first
one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards by the door.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: But there is some genetic mix.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Will there be further mutation?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Mutation isn’t exactly… I don’t think
so.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: That’s one of the things we need to study.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: All right. You can keep it. But secure, under
obsorvation, and for God’s sake keep it away from here. I don’t want any
more surprises.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: It took a hell of a lot to get us here.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: How soon before this one’s ovulating?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Days.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Is that normal?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: No way of knowing for sure, but I’d say it’s
accelerated.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: They’re coming. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>int. mess hall</strong>: Ripley sits across from Gediman. He
is eating at a good pace - Ripley, however, has stopped. She is staring
at her fork, her brows furrowed. Turns it over in her hand, in her
mind.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: “Fork.”</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: How did you…</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: How did we get you? Blood samples from
Fiori 16. On ice.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Does it grow?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Does it…..Yeah. Rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s a queen.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’ll breed. You’ll die. Everyone in the …
fucking…. … Company. Will die.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Company?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Weyland Yutani.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Our Ripley’s former employers. Terran Growth
conglom, had some defense contracts under the military. Before your
time, Gediman – they went under decades ago, bought out by Walmart.
Fortunes of war. You’ll find things have changed a good deal since your
time.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: 1 doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: We’re not flying blind here, you know. This is
United Systems military, not some greedy corporation. The potential
benefits of this race go way beyond urban pacification.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Oh, I am.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: And the animal itself is wonderous. They’ll be
invaluable once we’ve harnessed them.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s a cancer. You can’t teach it
tricks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: “Them” …</p>
<p><strong>int. hall continuous</strong>: As Wren is leaving the mess,
he is accosted by an ensign.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Doctor, General Perez is asking for you.
We’ve been hailed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. deep space</strong>: We see the Auriga far in the
distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME, heading for it.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit continuous</strong>: The music is coming from
nearby. Piloting the ship toward the Auriga is HILLARD, a roughskinned
woman in her forties, along with RANE, a slight and quiet fellow.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: My authorization code is ‘fuck you’, son. Now
open the goddamn bay or General Perez is gonna do a Wichita stomp on
your virgin ass.</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: Wichita stomp?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: I guarantee that boy’s. Never seen the inside
of a woman. Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Darlin’, it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Don’t cut thrust till six hundred meters.
Give em a little fright.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Christie! St Just! Rise and shine. We’re
docking.</p>
<p><strong>int. cargo bay - continuous</strong>: It’s the largest space
in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most of the space are two
HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly the size of
winnebagos.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Call! CALL!</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Call!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: We’re docking! Are the cargo trucks
secured?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I checked ’em an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: I don’t want em so much as rattled. Any
leakage, I take it out of your hide.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Trust me, boss.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: How’s it looking?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: You’ll make it good.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Don’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hall contintjous</strong>: CHRISTIE is up and
mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has distinctly military
bearing. He speaks with quiet, don’t-fuck-with-me authority.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: What’s our status?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: We’re coming in. Time to enjoy a little of
the general’s hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Oh great. Army food..</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: We could use a rest, till the heat’s off and
Vriess can get those harvesters on their feet. This’ll keep us for a
couple of days, assuming the natives are friendly.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: We expecting any trouble?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: From Perez? I doubt it. Still, let’s be ever
vigilant.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. cargo bay contniuous</strong>: ANGLE: VRIESS
working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the thresher inches
above his head.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: I’m patched in. Check the sequence timer.
Call?</p>
<p><strong>angle: the controls</strong>: A hand reaches in toward the ON
switch.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Call?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: You fuck!</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: You should see your face. Vriess, you must
have soiled yourself.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Well, you already gave him your feet …</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Either of you want a piece of me, I’m less
than busy.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Vriess. Forget it. He’s been sucking down too
much homebrew.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Don’t push me, little Annalee. You hang with
us a while, you’ll learn I’m not the man with whom to fuck.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: That inbred cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: 1 hate machines.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Well, now we know it works …</p>
<p><strong>cut to: ext. auriga docking bay</strong>: As it opens to
admit the proportionally tiny ship. The bay on the bottom of the
Auriga</p>
<p><strong>int. air lock</strong>: The outer doors close under the ship.
Pressurized air shoot into the airlock for a few seconds, and then the
inner door opens. the ship rising into the bay.</p>
<p><strong>int. bay</strong>: The ship moves slowly along the huge dock
to land gently at far end. The top of the ship is nearly level with a
grated platform that runs the length of the bay.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: No projectile weaponry is allowed on board
the vessel, sir.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Moonshine. My own. Much more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Wanna check the chair?</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. antechamber</strong>: The long neck that
connects the bay to the body of the ship. The group proceeds down it,
the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: This place is really clean.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: I think you’ll find our accomodations
somewhat spartan. Although the cook sets a good-table.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: That ain’t what I’m hungry for. VRIESS</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I don’t like army.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Yeah, join the fucking club.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: angle: money</strong>: A stack of bills dropped down
on a desk, then another. They’re green, and identifiably money. But
they’re square, about the size of cocktail napkins. The face on them is
unfamiliar. Thousand dollar bills.</p>
<p><strong>wider angle: int. perezis chambers later</strong>: A good
sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is behind
his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: This wasn’t easy to come by.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Neither was our cargo. You’re not pleading
poverty, are you?</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: We’re well funded. I mean the bills. There’s
not many that still deal in coin.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Just the ones that don’t like their every
transaction recorded. The fringe element.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Constantly. I’m guessing whatever you’ve got
going here wasn’t exactly approved by congress.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Out by the Handle. We’ve got a couple of
harvesters, we can unload ’em on one of the collectives if Vriess and
Call get ’em working.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Call. Where’d you find her?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: She is severely fuckable, isn’t she? - And
the very devil with a socket wrench.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: She is curious about this little transaction.
You can hardly blame her, Awfully cloak and dagger…</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: This is an army operation.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Most army research labs don’t have to operate
outside regulated space.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Do you want something, Elgyn?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Just bed and board, couple of days worth. If
we’re not imposing.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Not at all. Keep out of the restricted areas,
don’t start any fights, and mi casa is yours too.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: I trust, of course, that you can mind your
own business.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hallway - restricted area</strong>: The ‘cargo’
is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is wheeled
into:</p>
<p><strong>int. a chamber</strong>: Where Wren and a few others are
waiting. Gediman looks a little nervous, not sure this is a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. conference hall</strong>: A huge room, used for
assemblies and events. It has a chain basketball net set up at one end,
crude court lines taped to the floor. Ripley stands beneath the net with
a ball, dribbling absently.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Ooh.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: How about a little one on one?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Because pain hurts.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Ripley.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Don’t let’s have a scene.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: He… smells</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I imagine he does.</p>
<p><strong>angle: ripley’s blood</strong>: The few drops she flicked
away sizzle on the floor – not eating through, but melting a small
patch.</p>
<p><strong>to: int. labs - later</strong>: A large metal box is being
wheeled next to an observation pen. Soldiers surround it, weapons at the
ready. Not one of them at ease.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: What’s the status on the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: We still haven’t detected the origin of the
reproductive anomalies. But the egg laying stage appears to be over.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Did we do something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: I don’t know. I think we covered
everything. But these redundancies…</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Father, check security status, observation pen
six.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Pen six secure, security systems functional
at 100%.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Good. Now the others.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. sleep chambers - night</strong>: We see VARIOUS
ANGLES of people at night:</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. observation room - right</strong>: A sleep cycle
is indicated here by the low lighting and the near emptiness of the
room.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Beautiful, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Yes. Yes they are. I’ve been monitoring
their interaction.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: They communicate. Through ultrasonic
soundwaves. Sort of like bats.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I can hear them.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Ripley…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Shhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>smash cut to: int. ripley’s chamber</strong>: As she suddenly
awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: interior mess hall - night</strong>: Christie, Call,
St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker game, stacks of
bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Raise you two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Oh, fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: That’s it. I’m out. I’m fucked.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: That takes me down, too. Johner?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Uh, Uh, fuck it. I fold. What do-you
got?</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: You’ll always wonder.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: You asshole.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Johner, your deal.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Deal me out. It’s not my night.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit,
battery acid?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Just for coloring.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Bitches should not play with the boys, they
will get cleaned out. Eight card throwback, fuck your sister and the
sevens are wild.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hall</strong>: As soon as she is out of sight,
Call straightens up, completely sober. She looks around her and takes
off toward the restricted areas.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. cellblock - moments later</strong>: As Call pads
silently down it, looking for one cell.</p>
<p><strong>to: int. ripley’s cell - continuous</strong>: The cell door
opens silently. Call hesitates a moment, then slips in, shutting the
door behind her.</p>
<p><strong>angle: ripley’s chest</strong>: Her shirt is open enough to
show a good portion of the scar. Call hesitates, staring, realization
flooding her face.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You gonna kill me or what?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: There’s no point, is there?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: It’s already out of you. Christ… Is it here?
Is it on board?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Curious. I’m the latest thing…</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Those sick fucks.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I can make it stop. The pain… this nightmare..
That’s all I can offer you.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What makes you think I would let you do
that?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Ripley, Ellen, Lieutenant first class,
number 36706.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Ellen Ripley died two hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I’ve read Morse – I’ve read all the banned
histories. She gave her life to protect us from the beast. You’re not
her.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: If I’m not her. What am I?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: You’re a thing. A construct. They grew you in
a fucking lab.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: But only God can make a tree.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: And now they’ve brought the beast out of
you.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s in my head. Behind my eyes. I can hear
it moving. The beast.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Help me. If there’s anything human in you at
all, help me stop them before this thing gets loose.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: It’s already loose.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Once the thought …. the hope for it … grows
here…. it has found its way.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: You want that.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’ve come to terms with the fact of it. It’s
inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Not so long as there’s breath-in me.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I can… make it … stop…</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hall - continuous</strong>: Call comes out and
before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head. She goes down but not
out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them and three more.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I think you’re gonna find that this was ill
advised.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mess hall, most of them.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Sound the alarm. I want them rounded up.
Now!</p>
<p><strong>angle: the card table</strong>: Being kicked over.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: What the fuck is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Looks like a doublecross, boss.</p>

<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Do you mind telling me what the fuck you’re
up to?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Look, if there’s a problem tell me what it
is. We can work this out, there is no need to get emotional …</p>
<p><strong>angle: behind st just’s back</strong>: As Elgyn speaks, two
guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: They got nothing to do with this, Wren.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: I do. St Just?</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. alien observation lab - continuous</strong>:
Alarms, flashing red lights. Gediman looking in a video monitor.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: What the fuck… You three! Go! Sector
two.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. mess hall - continuous</strong>: When the smoke
clears, There are two guards still standing. They point their weapons
inneffectually. St Just a has gun to wren’s head and a gun on the
guards, who are also covered by Johner.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Nice and easy, boys …</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I’m gonna finish this.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: You’re going nowhere, Annalee.</p>
<p><strong>angle: in the pen</strong>: The three aliens have picked up
the energy. are stalking back and forth like tigers in the dim light of
their pen.</p>
<p><strong>angle: their pov</strong>: We see Gediman and the guard,
their backs to us. The aliens-stop pacing. One of them, to the right,
looks at the one on the left. Something passes between them. They look
back at the humans. At each other.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Oh, God</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: No no no!</p>
<p><strong>angle: his pov</strong>: Their blood has already eaten
through two levels.</p>
<p><strong>gediman</strong>: Christ. They could be anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. mess hall</strong>: The mexican standoff is
getting even more heated.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Who gives a shit! We have to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: If Call’s got something going here I want to
know what it is!</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: You brought her here..</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Drop them! I’m not fucking with you!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I have to stop him. If I don’t we’ll all
die.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: In what?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Does anyone want me to make this simple?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hallway by labs</strong>: A technican RUNS
screaming just as an alien LEAPS on him from behind. The CAMERA RUSHES
AWAY, frenzied as the scene, to pick up a guard in the next hall firing
wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up an airvent. There are
three bodies lying dead before us.</p>
<p><strong>angle: in the pens</strong>: We see that the aliens have been
freed. Smoke, dead bodies, the plexiglass partition to one 1 cage is
cracked and open.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. ripley’s cell - continuous</strong>: Ripley sits
in the dark, the noise of Chaos just beginning filter in. And she just
can’t help herself.</p>

mostly dressed, still shaking off sleep. He stands at the command
console, bringing up visual. Everything on the screens is smoke and
noise.</p>

<p><strong>perez</strong>: Status!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Containment is impossible, sir… I think
they swept the barracks.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. barracks - continuous</strong>: It’s worst here
– the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep, and everyone
awake is screaming. One soldier runs for the weapons cabinet – an alien
hits him from behind and SMASHES him into it, falling in a tumble of
guns.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures
immediately. All hands. This is not a drill.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures

the emergency lighting are on.</p>
<p><strong>angle: down the hall</strong>: There is nothing.. Just the
floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. next hall - continuous</strong>: Nothing here
either. But Vriess’s fur is up – he moves slowly, carefully.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. lifeboat bay one - continuous</strong>: Men are
rushing into one of the lifeboats. They sit facing each other in the
tiny vessel and strap themselves in. Pere is here, hurrying the soldiers
in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after.</p>
<p><strong>perez</strong>: Bay three! Go!</p>
<p><strong>cut to: ext. the auriga - continuous</strong>: As the
lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. bay three - continuous</strong>: Men crowd into
this one too – it’s nearly full and an alien suddenly LEAPS into it..
starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are screaming.</p>
<p><strong>to: ext. auriga - continuous</strong>: The second lifeboat
comes shooting out and moments later. EXPLODES.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. mess hall - continuous</strong>: The noise of
the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all around the
group.</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Nothing. Not a goddanm thing. You thought you
could control it.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: All right. We make for the Betty. Can he
walk?</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: You can have him when we’re off. Not
before.</p>

<p><strong>cut to int. fall - continuous</strong>: Vries enters, looking

cutting right through a soldier halfway out.</p>
<p><strong>angle: air vents</strong>: Gates slam down here as well.</p>
<p><strong>angle: electrical ducts</strong>: Foam SHOOTS into them,

<p><strong>father</strong>: Breach contained. Sector five
nonfunctional.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hall - continuous</strong>: As the crew moves
quickly through. They come to a shut door, red lights along it
indicating it’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: He can’t! The sector’s closed. The hull’s been
breached!</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Okay, which way?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: We’ll have to go through the holding cells.
Here.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>int. chamber - continuous</strong>: that leads to the holding
cells. The room is big, a railing at one end looking over another
chamber two flights down.</p>
<p><strong>elgyn</strong>: Can you get that one open?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Christie! Hillard! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: What the FUCK is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: What was that thing? Are there more of that
thing?</p>
<p><strong>angle: hillard</strong>: on the upper level, kneeling by
Elgyn’s body. No tears, but terribly quiet.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Same thing we were doing. We get the
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: What if there’s more? Let’s stay here and let
the army guys deal. Someone will come… I mean, where are the fucking
army guys?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Doctor. You know what that thing is?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: And there’s others. How many?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Thirty.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Thirty! We are fucked in our pink bottoms if
there’s thirty of those things.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: There’ll be more.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’ll breed. In a few hours there’ll be
twice that number. So who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: You bought your ticket when you killed
that thing. welcome aboard.</p>
<p><strong>call.</strong>: Are you fucking crazy? She doesn’t care if
we….</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Christie, she’s not human. Wren cloned her
because she was carrying an alien in her.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Nobody cares about your opinion, you bitch,
you fucking mole –</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: She’ll turn on us! Just like that!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I don’t give a syphallitic fuck whether
you people can get along or not. If we’ve got a wish to live then we
work together, and that includes bug-lady.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: You can’t trust her.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I don’t trust anyone. CUT TO: INT.
CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: There’s a console in the guards, station. We
can punch up a diagnostic of the ship and plan a route. To your
ship.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: That likes me fine.</p>
<p><strong>angle: hillard</strong>: Gently lays her coat over Elgyn’s
face. Johner looks down a moment.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Via con Dios, man.</p>
<p><strong>angle: in the cellblock</strong>: The group makes their way
slowly, quietly. They approach a bank of elevators, but Wren points down
an adjoining doorway. They are about to go there when the elevator door
lights up, indicating arrival.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Who sits in his chair, a shotgun in each
hand, eyes wide. twitchier than they.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Oh, fuck…</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: vriess!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Thought you were toast for certain.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: You’ve seen that fucking thing?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: I was down by – what do you mean? I was in
maintenance, checking out your oxidation systems.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Doc’s got a bug up his ass ’cause Call’s a
mole and he thinks we’re a conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: A mole. A fucking spy.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: We got’a mission here, people. Let’s keep
moving.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the console</strong>: A hologram of the ship appears
above the screen. It looks a solid as the ship itself, except that parts
of it occasional break themselves down to show interiors.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: We’ve had hull breach by the lifeboats, here
on level five, and down – Jesus, right by the engine room. We’re very
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: What about the Betty? Our ship.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: The dock seems to be intact.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Then we head for it.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Can we track those fucking things?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: We could get to the Betty and they could be
all over it!</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: Are you toting a better fucking idea?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: All of the activity seems’to have been in the
aft-sector, by the barracks.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: They’re breeding. They’ve got new bodies to
work on. They’ll stay close. If they send anybody out, it’ll be here.
Where the… meat is.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: ‘The meat’ . Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: They’re breeding. How long does that
take?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Hours.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Or less. The process has accelerated,
something to do with the cloned cells.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Faster we get from here to there, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: With all the devils of hell in between.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Well, if we want to make decent time I say
we ditch the cripple. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Nobody’s left behind, Johner. Not even
you.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: So what’s our route?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I’m trying to figure it. we can cut through
the labs, but we’re blocked on both sides here,</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: Sir? There is the lift.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: The lifts. They run straight from the top
of the ship down to engineering. No stops, but if we can get in the
shaft, there’s a maintenece access tunnel here that runs above level one
deck. Take us right to the dock.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: I don’t have the code for the access
tunnel door.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I can override.</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: Then we head through the labs, then down
to the kitchen. To the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p><strong>angle: vriess</strong>: Is unloading additional ammo from
inside his chair. He toss one of his shotguns to Hillard.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: They never check the chair…</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Call.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Try not to shoot your foot off.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: You people should know –</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: We.won’t shoot at the windows, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: No. The aliens, they bleed molecular acid.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: That’s right, I saw that.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: We can’t shoot them? Fuck that, I’m shooting
them.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: This is a big vessel, and for the most part we
should be okay. But if we get anywhere near the outer hull and start
strafing them…</p>
<p><strong>chistie</strong>: If we’re clear then let’s get on it. We’ll
go by twos –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We’re moving.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: The ship is moving. 1 can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: I don’t feel shit – what, do you mean they’re
piloting this fucking thing?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: This ship has stealthrun, even if we were
moving there’s no way she could feel it.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: The ship’s been going since the attack.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: It’s uh, it’s standard, I think.</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: That’s right. If the ship takes on any
serious damage it autopilots back to homebase.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: What is homebase?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Earth.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Oh, God. Oh, you bastard…</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Earth? I’m not going to that fucking
slum.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: If those things get to Earth, It’ll be…</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: That’s not our problem.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: We’ve got to blow the ship.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: We don’t have to do anything till we get
off it. How long till we get there?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Three hours. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Then that’s what we got. Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Don’t you understand what this means?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I understand my hide. And I like it on me.
Let’s go. What are you called, Ripley? You mind taking point?</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. labs - later</strong>: As they progress.
Everyone with a gun has it at the ready. Ripley is a few yards in
front.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: You’ve come up against these things
before?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: So what did you do ?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I died.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: That wasn’t really what I wanted to
hear…</p>
<p><strong>distepfano</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. lab - continuous</strong>: As Ripley enters, we
can see that this lab has been trashed. Ripley surveys the wreckage
calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their horrified expressions
lend contrast to her lack of one.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Fuck me …</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Let’s keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>int..next chamber</strong>: Something LEAPS at Ripley from
out of the shadows – a metal bar SLAMS into her side, throwing her off
balance.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Drop the rod, man. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>purvis.</strong>: Get away…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Purvis. What’s going on is that we’re
getting the fuck off this ghost ship.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What ship? Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the
way to Xarem, work crew for the nickel refinery…</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Look, you come with us. It’s dangerous
here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Leave him.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Fuck you. We’re not leaving anyone on this
boat.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: He’s carrying..</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: He’s what?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: He’s got one…. inside him. I can smell
it.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Inside me? What?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Shit, I don’t want one of those things
birthing anywhere near my ass.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: It’s a bad risk.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: We can’t just leave him.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: I thought you came here to stop them from
spreading.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: We’ve got no time for that.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: I couldn’t do it here. The lab’s torn
apart.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: There’s gotta be another way. If we freeze him
–</p>
<p><strong>what’s in-fucking-side me?!?!?</strong>: They all look at
him, a bit sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: A parasite. A foreign element that ….</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: There’s a monster in your stomach. They
hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him and he put an alien in you.
In a few hours it will punch its way through your chest and you’ll die.
Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I’m the monster’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: He comes with us. We can freeze him on the
Betty and get the doctor to remove it later.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Since when are you in fucking charge?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Since you were born without balls.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Ease off, people.</p>
<p><strong>cut-to: int. hall - later</strong>: still in the same general
area, still looking around every corner. It’s been too quiet too long,
and the group senses that &amp; They move into</p>
<p><strong>int. observation room two - continuous</strong>: It’s in bad
shape, so we might not recognize it as the chamber the queen was in.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: The Queen.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Pull back! Pull back!</p>
<p><strong>other soldier</strong>: It’s on me!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: We’ve got to help them!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Can’t.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: You bitch, let go of me!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: You want to get yourself killed, then you
run solo.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: At least two.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Think they heard us?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Fine by me …</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Yeah, let ’em come.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Wren. Any other way around?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: We can’t just walk in there.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: The cages all have failsafes. Liquid nitrogen.
Get ’em to come to us and I can freeze em.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Excellent. Get-ready.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Okay… Hey!</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Hey, guys!</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Here, kitty…</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: They’re not coming.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Hey! Fresh meat here!</p>
<p><strong>ripley.</strong>: They know it’s a trap.</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: Oh, bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Shoot the fucking things!</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: There’s too many, and we don’t have the
angle.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Bait.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Give em a reason to go in there. Throw
somebody in.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: DO we want to live? Give em her.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Or the skinny one, it doesn’t matter. We
can’t resist the smell of meat.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: We ?</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Fuck, I’m with her! Give ’em Annalee!</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Now hold on</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: You people are insane.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Now you’re not exactly in the club either,
soldier.</p>
<p><strong>rane</strong>: Fuck you all, I’m not dying for you.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Stop this.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Come on! Do you want to live or not?</p>
<p><strong>now!</strong>: Wren hits the button just as three aliens are
bounding across the cage – they’re almost to the posse, people
screaming, scrambling, when the freezing gas hits, turning the beasts to
statues.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: That’s how they knew it was a trap. They
couldn’t smell the fear.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: ext. auriga</strong>: Gildihg through space, passing
Jupiter’s moons with dazzling speed.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. hall later</strong>: Ripley and Call are on
point. Ripley looks down the hall. Call is staring at her, and</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I think you still might.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I want to live.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: And you don’t care about anything else.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: To kill you, remember? Because somebody has
to.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: well it’s not me. I did my time. Now I just
want to…</p>
<p><strong>distephmo</strong>: That’s not the way.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Ripley, we got no time for
sightseeing.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Ripley… don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. cloning storage facility - continuous</strong>:
She stands a moment, staring, before proceeding through it. Call stands
in the doorway, others crowding behind her. Every face registers the
horror of what they are seeing, but none more so than Ripley’s</p>
<p><strong>number seven</strong>: Kill … us …</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Ripley!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Ripley… Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Don’t do what?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Had it coming, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: What’s the big deal? Fucking waste of
ammo.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Let’s move before anything comes to check
out the noise.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Chicks, man….</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: We go down from here.</p>

<p><strong>christie</strong>: Kawlang maneuver, all right?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Just like old times…</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. room - later</strong>: A hatch opens. Ripley
drops down, surveys the scene. Quiet dark, empty.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No. You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: The cooling tanks. They must have blown
during the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the cooling tanks</strong>: We see the round
underbelly of two huge tanks. There are gaping, twisted holes in
them.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: The nasties couldn’t have done it, could
they?</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: What for…?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Down here. He is at the front with Ripley
and-Call, where the water is waste deep.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: There’s no other way?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: We’re at the bottom of the ship. Some of the
worst damage is down here.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: There’s the noncom’s entrance back there, but
it’s flooded too, and it’s a longer run.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: He’s right. We’re gonna have to do it this
way.</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: It’s just through the kitchen, then up, maybe
seventy feet.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: What’s to like?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: You sure about the distance?</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Yes.</p>

the gun, slides a panel over the digital readout.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: These are disposables. They can take
it.</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: Disposables. I heard about those. How
many rounds?</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Twenty. Split points, give you a good hole
even at the smaller caliber.</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: They’re big with hitters. ’Cause you throw
em away after the job. Nobody likes throwing away a weapon they’re
attached to. You know?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Do I have to tell everyone to take a deep
breath?</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Christie, do me a favor. When we hit the
surface on the other side… no backstroke. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. stairwell- continuous</strong>: It’s all
underwater. Visiblity is poor. The crew move swiftly and gracefully down

<p><strong>clamps down on her.</strong>: Ripley goes back under, pulling
at the thing as others break the surface.</p>
<p><strong>angle: underwater</strong>: Ripley pulls the face hugger with
all her might – it comes off, its fingers singeing the sides of her
face, leaving marks like warpaint. Worse, its probing fleshy member
pulls last of her throat, thrashing horribly.</p>
<p><strong>above - the surface</strong>: Most of the crew has gotten up
out of the water. Christie holding a facehugger inches from his face,
others screaming, taking a bead on it.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Get it! Kill it!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: The blood’ll burn you! Throw it!</p>
<p><strong>angle: under the surface</strong>: Ripley is grabbed by an
alien – and St Just comes up behind her and shoots it.</p>

water, and an alien rises right behind them. Everyone who can, shoots
it. It falls back into the water.</p>

<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Let’s get the fuck!</p>

<p><strong>johner</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>wren</strong>: Not far!</p>
<p><strong>angle: lift</strong>: Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge. He
climbs on. Set back a few feet from the shaft is a small maintenance

the code and slipped through the opening door..</p>
<p><strong>angte: calls face</strong>: As the facehugger CLAMPS onto it.
Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits probing Call’s nostrils. Sensing no
breath, the thing scurries away to find a better host.</p>

<p><strong>angle: down the shaft</strong>: The aliens are still coming,
but suddenly the lift passes them heading up at high speed.</p>

<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>cut to: int. lift - continuous</strong>: Call flips the brake

up the shaft.</p>

<p><strong>call</strong>: I’m fine.</p>

<p><strong>call</strong>: I’m fine!</p>
<p><strong>angle: call’s chest</strong>: Wren has indeed made a messy
hole here, but where blood and bone should be there is a tangle of
synthorganic wiring. To state the obvious:</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Call’s a goddam sythetic!</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Son of a bitch. Little Annalee’s just full
of surprises.</p>
<p><strong>st just</strong>: Couldn’t smell this one out?</p>

inhibitors. Didn’t feel like being told what to do.</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: 1 always heard there were a few that got
out alive, but man… I never thought I’d see one.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Oh, Christ. Doing fucking nickel and dime
border runs, selling second hand junk to the farm belt… and we’re
carrying the most expensive piece of contraband in the system.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Yeah, get your socket wrench, Vriess.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Let’s go.</p>

think we can get through to the garden.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: It’s a good point.</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: Another way?</p>
<p><strong>distephano</strong>: Uh, yeah. Through the wall. We’ll have
to get one of these panels off. It’ll take a while.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Yeah, but no torch.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Fucking blow the door!</p>
<p><strong>hillard</strong>: Assface, We’re on the top of this thing.
That’s hull.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: What about Wren? if he gets in the computer
he can really fuck us around.</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: We have to get in too.</p>

the hatch release sequence.</p>
<p><strong>angle: vriess.</strong>: Desperately pulling up as wooded,
snowy mountains zoom dangerously close below.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the alien</strong>: Turns as the HATCH OPENS nearby,
the door sliding slowly beast is torn between Ripley and this new
distraction –</p>
<p><strong>int. the betty</strong>: Ripley is hanging on Call,

<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Johner, strap in! We’re coming down
hard!</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: -BETTY Approaches the rough, wooded terrain,
just above the trees. Hits a relatively clear patch, touches down –

up hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>angle: the betty</strong>: The ship blasts through trees. The

<p><strong>newbom</strong>: Engulfed in flame, losing its grip –</p>

it</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Kill thrust! Now!</p>

debris. It hits another wooded area</p>

finally grinding to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: To make sure that thing is really dead</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: I think it’s gone!</p>

<p><strong>call</strong>: That thing is thirty minutes old! In a few
hours it’ll grow up. If it reaches a place with people…</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: You’ll never catch it.</p>
<p><strong>cut to: ext. betty - moments later</strong>: The ship sits
silent in the woods, the trees around heavy with snow.</p>
<p><strong>a city.</strong>: Sprawling, huge, a million tiny lights
cutting through the darknes it’s just before the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>angle: call</strong>: SLAMS into the newborn from behind, the
girl nearly thrown out of the harvester, the newborn spins and grabs it,
Call throws it into reverse but the newborn is too strong, holds on,
bringing its head up to face Call herself.</p>

the rockface, as she climbs back to the top</p>
<p><strong>angle: the newborn</strong>: SWINGS the harvester into a
tree, Call nearly knocked loose again. The monster is jolted as well,
lets go, Call pilots the machine back through the trees, the alien
watching it, growling –</p>
<p><strong>ripley</strong>: No! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: Ripley! Let it come! Let it come!</p>
<p><strong>angle: the grenade launcher</strong>: Halfway between her and
the newborn.</p>
<p><strong>angle: call</strong>: Still trapped below, she sees the
aliens blood seeping through the machine all around her!</p>
<p><strong>ripley!</strong>: Galvanized by the cry, Ripley TEARS herself
out of the beast’s dying grasp, flips backwards off the Harvester as it
begins to smoke and spark, blood eating through the controls.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to.- angle: the newborn’s skull</strong>: Burning,
hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it. Collapsing gently on
itself.</p>
<p><strong>ext. same - later</strong>: The four of them sit by the huge
camp-fire, watching the flames.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: The bitch takes her time in burning.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Well, it looks like she’s finally giving it
up.</p>
<p><strong>johner</strong>: Troopers should be finding our ship any time
now. 1 don’t much love the idea of being around when they do.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>vriess</strong>: Well, we’re on Earth, for Chrissake. Plenty
of places to get lost here.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: So I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>call</strong>: It’s a drink. You drink it.</p>
