<p><strong>grove air force base</strong>: AIR DEFENSE COMMAND
COLORADO</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: What’s happening here, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We must see Colonel Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Yes. We have to see him. Call him. He
talked at my school. He said we could come here any time we wanted. I
have to tell him what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: It’s extremely important. I’m the nurse
for the Tri-School District. It’s a public health problem.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. rinaldi</strong>: Base Commander’s office. Yes. Who?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: This is Colonel Wilson. Yes, I did
speak at the Hillcrest School a couple of days ago. Really. Hm. Very
well. Send them up. No, not in their own car. Have them driven up.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: You better not keep them here too damn
long.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I’m Colonel Wilson. This is Sergeant
Rinaldi.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I’m Linda Magnuson. I’m the nurse for the
Tri-School District, which includes the Hillcrest School.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: You mentioned something about a public
health problem.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll get to that. This is Jimmy Gardner, a
pupil at Hillcrest.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Won’t you sit down.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Please tell me what’s on your
minds.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: First I have to look at the back of your
neck.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s serious, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: All right. I had to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Sure of <u>what</u>?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s rather difficult to tell this story.
Yesterday Jimmy came to see me in my office. He was very upset…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: She’ll be out in just a second. … I’ve
had things like that happen. I had a dream, last night, where my little
sister showed up at my front door. Skinny little thing, we don’t get
along … anyway I open my front door this morning … and there she is! We
haven’t spoken in years. Now, you tell me how that happens.</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: Oh, Ms. Magnuson, he’s here to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I was just leaving – I’m due over in Riverton
in 20 minutes. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You look like you’re feeling better. I’m here
to help you. Is there anything you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nothing I can help with?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re going to wait me out, are you?</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: “I couldn’t get a word out of him,
and I did have to get over to Riverton. But I stopped into the
Principal’s office on my way out …”</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s the story on Jimmy Gardner?</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Gardner? Oh, um – he’s a new student.
Just moved here. Why?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: His teacher brought him in to see me. Said
he’d been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance. I couldn’t get a
thing out of him.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s his family background?</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: They’re from out of state. Father’s an
engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don’t know much about
them.</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: “I had a busy afternoon and evening,
and I didn’t think any more about it until the following morning, when
it was brought back to my attention in a forcible manner …”</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Jimmy, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You have to help me! You have to!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s all right, Mrs. McKeltch. Let me talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What did he see you doing?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How was he spying on you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All right. Wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s okay. I’m here to help. I won’t betray
you. Whatever you tell me, stays in this room.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: First … can I see the back of your neck?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Now, have I earned the right to know what
that was about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mrs. McKeltch, if you’re going to wait, could
you please have a seat? It’s very hard to concentrate with your shadow
on the door.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is a new town for you. Do you like it
here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why not? Moving is hard for anybody. Was it
hard for you to leave all your friends?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t have many friends. Dad’s all the time
moving.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Can you tell me about that?</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: “Finally, he broke down and began to
talk.”</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’d better take over here. Tell it to the
Colonel the way you told it to me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, sir, it all started a couple of weeks
ago …</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: … sounds interesting …</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: … critical … great opportunity, George … up
the ladder … arranged.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: … moving again …</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: … all right … you’re right, of course …</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Good night … night … George. Talk to me from
there.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: … up yet, do you suppose?</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: … look … maybe.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Son … are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We’re going to be moving, son.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do we have to?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know, son. But you’ll like it where we’re
going. I’m getting a good job. It’s a pretty part of the country.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll have to go to a new school – again.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You’ll meet new friends. I know … it’s rough.
But I have to move, son.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s voice</strong>: “Like I said, we move around a lot.
Dad’s really good at his job, and when they open a new plant, they
always ask him to go work at it. So I was used to it. But I was sad
…”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s that, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s the Air Force Base.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you going to sell power to them, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No, son. They have their own.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are those, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s their radar, Jimmy. It picks up anything
that moves across the sky.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Our new home, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: This furniture will have to go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow. Look at the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: This can be your room if you want it. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is the hill ours too?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: If we want it, it is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s check it out, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow. There’s the town. And there’s the air
base. This is a great hill.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: It’s got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be
a copper mine near here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s see what’s on the other side. Maybe
we’ll find some copper.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow …</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Well, isn’t this something. Be careful if you
play here.</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: George … ! Jimmy … !</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Let’s go help your mom set up house.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A meteorite, Dad, look!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: It’s that time of year again. We should get a
pretty good show out here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Because the sky is so clear out here.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Okay, Jimmy. You’re all set. This man,
Mr. Cross, is your Principal. He’ll take you to your classroom.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cross</strong>: Hello, Jimmy. Welcome to Hillcrest
School. Will you come with me.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Jimmy, I’m Mrs. McKeltch. Your new teacher.
This is the fifth grade – Class, this is a new pupil, Jimmy Gardner. I
know you’ll make him feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>a kid</strong>: Lookit his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Welcome. I’m new here myself.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: The United States Government maintains
bases in every state and even in some other countries, by mutual
agreement between those countries and us. Grove is part of the Air
Defense Command – which has the responsibility of repelling any aerial
attack on the United States. You’ve all seen and heard our planes flying
over. They protect this city and the surrounding area out to a distance
of approximately 300 miles. In addition we do research involving some of
the most advanced aircraft in the world.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We have two fighter-interceptor wings
at the base … consisting of four squadrons each of F-15 fighters. Each
wing has 10 pilots. Some of them are administrators – just like your
teachers and principals who work in your school. There are maintenance
and supply buildings. Parts for planes, trucks, cars, food storage,
refrigeration plants … a power plant for electricity, fuel storage,
cooking facilities, mess halls … In other words, boys and girls, Grove
Air Base is just like a self-contained little city and can survive by
itself for an extended period of time.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We are your protection against any
hostile forces that threaten the peace and security of this school,
city, or the country. Do you have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Are there any girl pilots in the Air
Force?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: As a matter of fact there are quite a
few now. Most of them are attached to the Military Airlift Command.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: How do you prevent planes from sneaking
up on you?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We have radar that looks at the sky day
and night. It’s a brand new radar called phased array. So nothing can
sneak up on us.</p>
<p><strong>another boy</strong>: Can we come and see the planes
sometime?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I would welcome all of you to visit.
You can call me personally and arrange a school or group visit almost
any time. Well – boys and girls, I hope I’ve answered some of your
questions. I hope you have a better idea of what Grove Air Force Base is
doing here. I’ve enjoyed talking to you today and I know you’ll look at
me and the other airmen on the base as your friends.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Are you stuck up? Or maybe you’re just
dumb.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: He really looks dumb to me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, the same to ya!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: There goes another one. That was a bright
one.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There Dad – look!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There are more this year than last.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: This should be the heaviest shower of the
year.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There’s Cassius …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: … and Rigel.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: And that one – to the right of Rigel?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Pessius.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Which one’s that? The dull, red one.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s Mars. The closest planet to us, now.
That’s why it’s more than just a point in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Well, come on, you two. Time to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom – this is the best show all year.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know. But you have a full day of school
tomorrow – You, too.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Five minutes more.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Well, son? Should we call it a night? I for one
have had a long day.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Goodnight – sleep well. Dream a nice one for
me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You too, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Dad! Mom!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Jim – what’s wrong?!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’ve got to come see – a big thing went
down over the hill!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It was big – and it glowed – and it went down
over there – behind the hill.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What did it look like?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It was – it was – it changed shape. First it
was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Are you sure you saw that? In the rain – it may
have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know, Dad. But it was big.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’ll go take a look when the rain lets off.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What do you think he saw? Could it have been
something from the air base?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, Mom. It wasn’t a plane.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You go back to sleep. I’ll look when it’s
light.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did you see anything, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you all right, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Sure … fine.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: George, where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What happened to your other slipper?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I lost it. It’s kind of muddy out there.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Was there anything over the hill?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Nothing I could see, son. It was a bad dream is
all.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What happened to your neck, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A branch must have nicked me.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: How are you today, son?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your father asked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What? – I…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Both of you eat this before it gets cold.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I have to go over to the town this morning and
do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I’ll
probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you’ll be late.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’ll take you to school.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You don’t have to. The school bus stops right
outside here, at 7:30. I’ve got to run.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: George … the car won’t start.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: That’s strange. I had a dream last night, where
the car wouldn’t start. Isn’t that funny …</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Try it again.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: It’s probably the solenoid. Take it back to
Gleason’s, they said they’d fix it if we found anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I will. But isn’t that odd – about my dream …
?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Let me walk you to the bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You know something, son? You were right. There
is something over the hill.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Come on. I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Those are twin reactors. Sodium cooled
cores. Best damn design in the whole country. Never worry a minute about
them.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: There it is. We know exactly how much
extra juice we can throw into the network just by checking the
reactors.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Larry – George Gardner. I was just
showing George around. He’s our new whiz kid – trouble shooter. He’s
gonna be your new supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: George tells me he’s programmed a crisis
into our simulation tape. He wants to see how we do.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Flick that switch.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’ve just taken control of all the electric
power in the western sector of the United States. You’ve run one of
these before. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s the transient I programmed. … Okay?
– we’re losing Colorado … Nevada … Utah … It’s going to crash … the
whole system … There it goes –</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: See? The system’s self-limiting the problem.
It’s cutting off power in cells to preserve the entire network.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: … And how does it do that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It’s designed to. We just put it in. As long
as the ADP’s are functioning they’ll always save the total network.
Faster than any human response.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What if the ADP’s fail?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: That’s highly unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Unit #2 over there – – isn’t counted on the
grid. If it’s needed it kicks in and gives us a 12% safety margin.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And if that doesn’t do it?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Oh – well – in that case you’d have a
catastrophic failure. We’d lose the whole thing – “vapor lock” it so to
speak, and not be able to start it up again for hours.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Frogs?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: She’ll be out in just a second. … I’ve
had things like that happen. I had a dream, last night, where my little
sister showed up at my front door. Skinny little thing, we don’t get
along … anyway I open my front door this morning … and there she is! We
haven’t spoken in years. Now, you tell me how that happens.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You look like you’re feeling better. I’m here
to help you. Is there anything you want to talk about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nothing I can help with?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re going to wait me out, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s voice</strong>: “That was the first time I saw Linda.
I was too scared to say anything. And I didn’t want to get my Dad in
trouble. But when I got home that night …”</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hi. Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The back door was open.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: George? George?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hello … is George Gardner there, please. This
is his wife. How long ago was that? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He left just after three.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hello, can you tell me the phone number of the
police?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Evening Ma’am. I’m Chief Ward, and this is
Officer Keneny.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Thank you for coming, Chief. My husband left
work hours ago and hasn’t come home. It’s not like him.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Is there anywhere you can think of that he
might be? We’ll be glad to check.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We only just moved here. Where would he go?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe he went back over the hill.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What hill?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: My husband was looking behind that hill this
morning. We thought we might have seen an aircraft crash there.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Oh? When was that?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, it was early – just before dawn. But it was
nothing, he already looked.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’ll have a look.</p>
<p><strong>officer keneny</strong>: I didn’t hear anything about any air
crash …</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, my God, George, you scared the life out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: This is Ed. Ed, this is my wife. This is my
son.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Couldn’t hardly do much better. And
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Yes … I’m … fine. George, where were you? You
scared us to death.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, guess I better be going.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: See you later, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What happened to you? Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s Ed. Ed works with the Bell Telephone
switching division.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I left it at work.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You did? Why? Where were you? They said you
left hours ago. We were worried.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Yes, I see.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m home now.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Yes – but …</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I see that you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You know, it really is beautiful up there. Let
me show you. We’ll take a walk after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: George, you’re acting very strangely.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom. I gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t go over the hill, Mom. Please.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Why not, Jimmy? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom, something happened up there to Dad – He
got a scratch on his neck – Promise, Mom. Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What’s wrong, Ellen?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s his nightmare. He still hasn’t gotten over
it … about the other side of the hill.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m afraid you’re still upset by our moving,
son. You’ll get over it. Let’s finish the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: How about tomorrow, we’ll take a walk up there
when it’s light. Okay? Go to bed now, son.</p>
<p><strong>a door slams.</strong>: Jimmy awakes with a jerk. He’s fallen
asleep at the window sill. He looks at the clock. 12:20. His eyes fly to
the ridge.</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: … it’s late … he’s probably asleep.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: … tomorrow … midnight …</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: … yes.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Not hungry? Jimmy, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I have a wonderful idea. Why don’t we all go on
a picnic up in the hills.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: This afternoon. It’s wonderful up there – you
still haven’t seen the best part.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I have school.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’ll pack us a lunch. Hamburgers. You always
like that, don’t you.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Your bus is here.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: … Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Jimmy, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You have to help me. You have to!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s all right, Mrs. McKeltch. Let me talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s okay. I’m here to help. I won’t betray
you. Whatever you tell me, stays in this room.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: First … can I see the back of your neck?</p>
<p><strong>linda’s voice</strong>: “You can imagine my skepticism,
Colonel, when I heard Jimmy’s story.”</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Eating a frog?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s quite a story. You know that, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: A UFO lands in back of your house and puts
something in your Dad and Mom’s necks. Then it gets the police, and your
teacher too.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She said the frog came from around the Copper
Ridge. She must’ve been behind the hill.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What would you think if somebody told you a
story like this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’d believe him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ’Cause he wouldn’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stay here a minute.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mrs. McKeltch … Jimmy seems troubled by an
injury to your neck.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He says you have a bandage on it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why don’t you let me have a look at it? I
might be able to help you clear it up.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with
you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why, yes.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Jimmy’s father is on the phone. I wonder
if you’d take the call.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All right. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: I understand, Miss, that you have my
son in your office.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: May I ask why?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We were having a little talk.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Children often have trouble adjusting to a
new school.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: I don’t know what he’s told you – What
<u>has</u> he told you? Would you like to tell <u>me</u> – ?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mr. Gardner, I –</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: You people have a lot of nerve, taking
it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I’m
of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to
handle … What sort of training do you have anyway?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Mr. Gardner, I don’t think this is the place
to discuss this matter.</p>
<p><strong>dad’s voice</strong>: I’m not particularly interested,
<u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are
going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.
Keep him in your office until we arrive.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We’ll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes, Mr. Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That was your father. They’re coming to pick
you up in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You can go out that window – it leaves you
off at the back of the school building.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Do you know how to follow a map?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes. I can even read star maps.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This shows how to get to my home. I’m giving
you back roads and footpaths, so there’s less chance of you being
seen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is the key to my back door. I’ll meet
you there when school lets out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll go out and occupy the Principal. I never
saw you leave. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cross’s voice</strong>: Good afternoon, Mrs. McKeltch.
Enjoy your weekend.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What do you mean – gone? What the hell kind of
a nurse are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my
office for a minute and when I got back – he was gone.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What did he talk to you about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He was upset with moving, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Is that all he said?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why, yes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ms. Magnuson! Ms. Magnuson! I found them –
they’re down in the tunnels!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Jimmy, calm down! What happened? Tell me what
happened!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch’s van – and
she went to the tunnel and went down there with them – behind my house.
I saw them.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Behind my house, up on the ridge.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If we go and look and there’s nothing there,
you’ll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This is the spot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This is where it was – the tunnel
opening.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, but it was here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It isn’t here. It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I swear it was here.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But it’s not, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let’s go look at the sand pit behind your
house.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’ll get us.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We’ll be very careful. But we have to see. If
something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground.
Wouldn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Be careful. Please be careful.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Does it look to you like anything landed
here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe – it landed in the bushes.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Jimmy – we’re already in trouble, both of us,
because of me helping you run away. Now, I can make up a story that will
smooth things over. Your house is right down there. Why don’t you let me
take you home, and tell your parents something that will make them not
be mad at us?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: … Afterwards the two Air Force men came back
in their truck. They drove by us like nothing had happened. Now they’re
on the base. I saw them.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. rinaldi</strong>: That would be Hollis and Johnson. They
were assigned to ground search in this area.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are we going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, no! The cops are with <u>them</u>!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stay here. I’m going to make a phone
call.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The State Police.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes, I’d like the number of the State Police
in Denver, please. Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Did you call the State Police?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: All their lines were busy.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s one place we can hide, while we call
the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No one comes here after dark.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hide the car.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know a way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s the number?</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: “All circuits are busy at this time.
Please try again later.”</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Still busy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There was this guy with Dad … who said he
worked at the telephone switching division.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing
here –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But you saw – the men go under the sand …</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes … yes, but I’m not sure what I saw
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Don’t go in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m not. They must be tunneling under the
whole town.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We can’t do this alone. We’ve got to get
help.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from
the Air Force Base. He was talking in our class. He said we could visit
him any time we wanted. I’ll bet he could do something.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let’s try.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Colonel Wilson – whatever is supposed to
happen – it’s supposed to happen at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I assure you – it’s true, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I can see that you’re sincere, but I’m
sure you can understand how hard it is to believe this story.</p>
<p><strong>aide’s voice</strong>: Colonel, Lts. Hollis and Johnson are
here to see you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson’s voice</strong>: – Send them in.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: You two are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Now you two are going to tell me what
this is all about.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Close the base. Seal the perimeter.
Alert base security.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I want these two men taken to sick bay
and autopsied.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We’ve sealed the base. I’m increasing
security around the launch.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I’m not sure …</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We have a launch scheduled for tonight.
We thought, by launching it from here, we could minimize publicity.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We’re disguising it as a military
satellite launch. Only it’s not a satellite.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Go ahead. Tell them.</p>
<p><strong>technician #1</strong>: It’s a soft landing mission.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>technician #2</strong>: To Mars.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mars!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What will the rocket do?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: It will explore a 50-mile square of Mars –
looking for life. It’s designed to retrieve samples from beneath the
Martian surface, down to 200 feet.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Earth and Mars are in this relative
position only once every 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: We <u>have</u> to launch tonight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re looking for life?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They didn’t find any signs of life on the
Viking missions.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: That’s why we’re looking beneath the
surface this time. Something might be able to live down below.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: And if it does – it might not want to
be found.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The tunnels.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: There’s something you two should know.
Two nights ago there was a very large meteor fall on our radar – but no
reports of a strike. We were on full alert for an hour, and we’ve had
search teams out, looking for a sign of some kind of impact or landing.
Hollis and Johnson were the ground team assigned to your area.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: I want every man on the base checked. I
want updates every five minutes from launch control.</p>
<p><strong>fellow worker</strong>: George – you’re here late.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Mr. Gardner – I didn’t expect you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I have some work to do. This is my wife.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s not necessary, Mr. Gardner. Go right
in.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: What’s this, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s a simulation tape I have to run.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: What … ?!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom knocks the man out! –</strong>: while Dad grabs
control of the board. Jimmy’s Dad starts flicking switches – defeating
the system. SIRENS WHOOPING – people running around in the room.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Henry … Guards! … in here!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Dammit! Plant #2! The damping rods just
went in! Both reactors are out!!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s a shut-down – a complete shut-down
– Christ Almighty!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s wrong with our goddamn generators?! Get
them turned on.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Chief – the phones just went out.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Calm down! And SHUT UP!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I want this town sealed tight. No one in or
out – they’ll be no looting during this crisis.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Chief – we’re not going to have any looting
– and the power will be back in a few minutes, probably.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: That’s a direct order, Smith. I want everyone
armed with riot weapons. Set up roadblocks on all the main arteries.</p>
<p><strong>officer keneny</strong>: You heard the Chief, boys. Let’s get
to it.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Go to base auxiliary power.</p>
<p><strong>security men</strong>: Halt!</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Looks like the runways, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Launch security reports two men stopped
trying to damage the rocket.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Do they have any damage?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They’re running checks now.</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Telemetry and tracking reports radar
temporarily out.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Do we know what caused the power
blackout?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: It looks widespread, sir. A rolling blackout
that started with the power company.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Get me a status report on our aircraft.
Do we have anything up top right now?</p>
<p><strong>flight officer</strong>: An F-4 on approach. He’s out of
fuel, sir. Coming down.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Are we in radio contact with him?</p>
<p><strong>flight officer</strong>: He says it looks like the whole
state is out.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Sir, base communications are
out. It’ll take us an hour to get up. Cheyenne knows we’re not hit.
Their sensors will tell them that but we’re out of touch.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Scramble what we can. We’ll use our
planes as a radio link.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Flight operations reports heavy damage to
runways 2 and 4, sir. For the time being we’re down across the
board.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Christ –</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: What about our phones?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They’re out. Separate problem with the long
distance lines.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: I’m going down to the launch site and check
firsthand.</p>
<p><strong>tech #3</strong>: Launch center reports their computer
updates are suspect because of the power failure.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Telemetry and tracking are tied to
external power. We can’t launch. It looks like a scrub.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Sir, operations reports base
radar back in service.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Anything coming in?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Negative, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: They’re already here.</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Also, sir, base security just arrested
two technicians trying to steal equipment in the middle of the
blackout.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Steal? What?</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: Copper wire, sir. A lot of it was
loaded onto a base truck.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Copper wire?</p>
<p><strong>comm officer</strong>: They just finished the autopsy on
Hollis and Johnson. They say they’ve removed an “electronic pin” from
the base of both Hollis and Johnson’s brains. The thing was capable of
receiving radio signals. It triggered a cerebral hemorrhage in both of
them – on command.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Then my Mom and Dad …</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Jim – can you take us to that place –
the sand pit?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Are the jeeps and half-tracks okay?</p>
<p><strong>transport officer</strong>: Ready to go when you are,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: A base like this has troops stationed
on it to ensure its security. We’re not out of options yet.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Let’s roll, Rinaldi. Curtis. Everyone
we can muster, goes.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Colonel – the tunnel under the school.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Curtis, you take a platoon of men and
head for the school. Enter the tunnel and move forward to the extent
possible.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Let’s get those masks on.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Better put this on. You too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>the chief</strong>: No one allowed through.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: This is official government
business.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Get those men to sick bay.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s up there – just ahead.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: You have two seconds to move that
barricade.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: You crazy idiot!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Pick ’em up and move ’em out!</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Downstairs – in the furnace room.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: All right men. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Let’s go! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: It’s not going to go – it’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: This way! – Through the windows!</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>man with metal detector</strong>: We’re getting nothing
below.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: We’re getting a signal from the
transmitter on Rinaldi. If we get a second receiver we can pinpoint his
location.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Get going.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Any word from Curtis?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: A message 5 minutes ago. They’ve entered the
tunnel and are coming in this direction as fast as they can.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: We have your parents, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are they –</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: They’re still alive. They’re in a
hospital, being operated on right now. A neurosurgeon is on his way from
Denver. He should be there in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But in an hour –</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: They’ll be all right, Jimmy. They have
excellent doctors in Denver.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Better than the Martians?</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s aide</strong>: Colonel! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>colonel’s aide</strong>: The boy and the woman – were sucked
down! Like Rinaldi!</p>
<p><strong>technicians</strong>: Colonel – we have a fix on Rinaldi’s
transmitter.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: All right – let’s go in. Set the
charges.</p>
<p><strong>demolition man</strong>: Set, Colonel. Whenever you say.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Lieutenant, tell our people at the far
end of the pit to fire their mortars and rockets at ground targets so
they won’t be able to tell where we’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: All right, men. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’s Linda?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please don’t. Please don’t hurt her. I’ll do
anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Linda! Linda … !</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: This has been melted out, then instantly
re-sealed – amazing …</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: There’s no time. Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Stop. Go back.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know my name.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I ain’t tellin’ you nothin’. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’re trying to stop you. Why are you
invading us? What do you want with my Mom and Dad? Why are you stealing
copper?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let them go! Let my Mom and Dad go! I’ll fix
you!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Captain Curtis!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s voice</strong>: Captain Curtis … this way!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This way … hurry!</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Set charges.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Everybody out … !</p>
<p><strong>demolition man</strong>: We’ve placed the charges. Give me a
time.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Give us five minutes to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They’ve sealed off the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Start digging.</p>
<p><strong>demolition man</strong>: Three minutes thirty left …</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: They use these to tunnel. Maybe we can –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I saw them do it.</p>
<p><strong>col. wilson</strong>: Everyone get back – get back!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom … Dad!</p>
<p><strong>mom/dad</strong>: It’s all right … It’s all right …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I had an awful dream.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What, Jim, what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: First lemme look at your necks.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That must have been some dream.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I dreamed a UFO landed behind the hill and
put a thing in your neck. First you went out to look at it by yourself,
and then the cops came …</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: … And then everything blew up. And then I
woke up.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s a doozy of a dream, son.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It was so real, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: It was all made of stuff that’s happened to you
in the last few days. The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor
shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being
afraid of the new kids because you don’t know them …</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s all this moving from place to place. We’re
never settled. I’m having nightmares myself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What kind, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh, I can’t remember. But people do have bad
dreams when their routine is disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I know, Ellen. We’ll settle down soon.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was so scared.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Better now, son?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Better get some sleep, son, or you’ll be pretty
tired at school tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ’Night.</p>
