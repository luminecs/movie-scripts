<h1 id="awakenings">awakenings</h1>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - night - 1930</strong>: Drifting away from the
painting and slowly across a room. Across Venetian blinds, open, letting
in moonlight, across intricate handmade wooden models, dime novels and
comic books, across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and
forth, and settling finally on a small hand writing slowly and
deliberately, over and over, in synchronization, it seems, to the rhythm
of the metronome, the word, ” L E O N A R D . ”</p>
<p><strong>2. int. dining room - morning - 1930</strong>: The pendulum
of a clock. An adult hand placing a bowl of cereal on a table. Leonard,
ten or eleven, waits a moment for the adult to leave, grasps his spoon,
and manipulates it from bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular
rhythm of the clock.</p>
<p><strong>3. ext. street - new york - morning - 1930 3.</strong>:
Schoolbooks slung over their shoulders, Leonard and another boy his age,
a classmate, move along a street. All around them are “visual rhythms” -
lines in the sidewalk, the even placement of trees, the sunlight
breaking through the branches above them - and somewhere unseen, the
rhythmic pounding of an elevator train. As they climb a fence, a pocket
watch, Leonard’s, falls to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>4. int. classroom - day - 1930</strong>: An adult hand
chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard. Children at desks
dutifully transcribing the lesson. All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are
trembling slightly and whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack
of rhythms. A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk. The boy
from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently tapping the end of
his pen against his desk. Leonard, “guided” by the cadence of his
friend’s tapping, begins to write.</p>
<p><strong>5. int. classroom.- later - day - 1930</strong>: The finished
poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at play on the
schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,</p>
<p><strong>6. int. leonard’s bedroom - day - 1930 - winter</strong>: The
painting on the wall. The intricate wooden models and dime novels. The
Venetian blinds, closed, shutting out sunlight. Voices, barely audible,
from somewhere else in the house:</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: When can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: When he’s well.</p>
<p><strong>6.c0nt. boy’s voice 6.cont,</strong>: When will he be
well?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>6a. ext. bainbridge -hospital - the. bronx - day - 1970 .
6a</strong>: Tight on the face of a man , late thirties, glasses,
staring up at the face of a building, imposing in its institutional
dullness.</p>
<p><strong>6b. int. lobby - bainbridge - day 6b.</strong>: A dim, sleepy
cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard operator thumbing through a
magazine. Echoing footsteps reach her station and she glances up and at
the man from outside.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>7. int. administration office - bainbridge - day</strong>: He
seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it’s the suit. Or the place. Or the
situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he’s in. When he does
finally speak, it’s with great sincerity –</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: When you say people … you mean living people,
.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Living people, yes. Patients.</p>
<p><strong>7.c0nt. 7.</strong>: There’s some mistake. And Sayer’s chair
begins to feel more</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I ’ m here for the research position . . . in
your neurology lab.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Neurology lab?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We have an x-ray room.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: - The-position-ds-Staff-^Neurologist. .</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: A doctor … doctor.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: The Camel Institute. Tell me about that,
anything with patients there? Or . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Earthworms.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Sorry? ,</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It was an immense project. ” I was trying to
extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms.</p>
<p><strong>7.c0nt. director 7.</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I was on it for five years. I was the only
one who really believed in it. The rest of them said it couldn’t be
done. t</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: It can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Well, I know that now. I proved it.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Maybe before. At Saint Thomas. All
research. Earth - ?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Pigs brains . . . they�re quite similar to
human brains.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Are they?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Oh, yes . . . three years.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here.
Clearly you’re looking for someone with more of a clinical
background.</p>
<p><strong>7.c0nt. sayer . 7.</strong>: I’ve taken enough of your time.
You must have a hundred applicants more suitable.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Back in medical school …</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I mean, you couldn’t have graduated
without some clinical experience. .</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well, there we are, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: You do want the job, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>8. int. corridor - bainbridge - day 8.</strong>: Moving along
a corridor crowded “with patients, some ambulatory, some in
wheelchairs,”living people” living with profound neurological
disease.</p>
<p><strong>anthony o.s.</strong>: Spent much time in chronic hospitals,
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>female patient 1</strong>: Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello . .
.</p>
<p><strong>8.c0nt. anthony 8.</strong>: You’d remember.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Hey, how you doing? Dr. Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>old patient</strong>: Fn … ie</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Dr. Sullivan, this is Dr. Sayer;</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Not the neurologist, that’d be asking too
much. You’re not the neurologist.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I think I am.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for
Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>10. int. dayroom - day 10.</strong>: A woman in a wheelchair
uttering high-pitched screams . Sayer in a lab coat trying to calm
her.</p>
<p><strong>10.cont. sayer . 10.</strong>: They’re just pencils,
pens.</p>
<p><strong>11. int. dayroom - day 11.</strong>: A man in his sixties
confronts Sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice -</p>
<p><strong>male patient 1</strong>: X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae,
New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided
a� the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I
was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the hell &gt;are.v.ou? .</p>
<p><strong>12. int. dayroom - day 12.</strong>: Stepping around a
wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly woman, nicely dressed, her hair
done-up, a ribbon in it. Glancing at the chart in his hand -</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Mrs. Cohen?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cohen</strong>: He�s here?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I ’m here. To examine you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cohen</strong>: Oh, no, I ’ m leaving today. My son’s
coming to take me home.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen’s son. He’s coming
today?</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: I wouldn’t bet on it, he hasn’t for twenty
years.</p>
<p><strong>13. omitted .</strong>: v</p>
<p><strong>14. int. examination room/office- later - day</strong>:
Silence. Institutional beige walls. Glass cabinets, locked, containing
medical instruments. A metal examination table with leather straps.
Sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room, still unsettled
from the experience with Mrs. Cohen. Eventually, he gets up, crosses to
a window and tries to open it. It’s jammed shut, painted shut perhaps,
but finally gives way, sliding up. He lets the air from outside wash
over his face as he stares out absently at children on an elementary
school playground beyond a debris-strewn field.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello o.s.</strong>: It gets easier.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: You don’t think it will, but it
does.</p>
<p><strong>15. int. tenement - new york.- day 1</strong>: The needle of
a Victrola clawing at the endless music-less inner bands of a 78 . . . .
. Cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette table.
A puddle of coffee on the floor. Ceramic shards, a broken cup. . An old
woman on her knees, eyes closed, arms tangled in an aluminum walker,
limp and stiff at once somehow, like the limbs of a discarded
marionette. Beyond her, beyond a threshold, a shuttered living room.
Furniture from another era and the clutter of a lifetime. A shadowy
figure in a wicker wheelchair near the Victrola. Another old woman, with
spindly limbs, profoundly afflicted and preposterously still. The back
of her head is flat and bald, the result of lying supine upon it for
much of several decades. On her passive face rest round wire-rim
glasses. Insane or retarded and unaware of the dead woman, she mumbles,
just barely audibly, a melody.</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: Can you hear me? .</p>
<p><strong>16. int. examination room/office - bainbridge - day</strong>:
Distant music of children’s laughter. Perhaps real, emanating from
outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote region of the
woman’s damaged mind. Arrested of all movement, she stares, transfixed,
at the blades of a fan.</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: Do you know where you are? Do you
remember being brought here? Do you know what has happened?</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>16.cont. 16.</strong>: Sayer reaches to her face and
carefully pulls the glasses from it. He cleans them with a flap of his
lab coat – they are loose, bent out of shape– and gently slides the
temples back over her ears. He turns away from her and types at a manual
Underwood. The form in the machine, at the top, reads – BAINBRIDGE
HOSPITAL / ADMISSIONS / CONSULTATION REQUEST / NEUROLOGY. Sayer types in
a lower section headed – FINDINGS / DIAGNOSIS. He turns back in his
chair to find the woman doubled-over in her wheelchair, one arm very
close to the floor, the hand clutching the glasses. She is not moving,
but she has moved. That, or she is dead. Sayer rights her, takes the
glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face. He studies her
for a moment, and for that moment remains as still, as entranced, as
her. He takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the
floor. He waits. She doesn’t retrieve them. He picks them up and holds
them out to her. She doesn’t move to take them. He lets go of them and
she lunges forward, catching them the instant before they hit the floor.
Sayer just stares.</p>
<p><strong>sayer�s voice</strong>: Her name is Lucy Fishman . . .</p>
<p><strong>16b. int. corridor outside examination room - late afternoon
16b.</strong>: Dr. Kaufman, the hospital’s Chief of Medicine, notices a
number of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on
his way into Sayer’s examination room -</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: She was found by neighbors with her
sister, several days after the , sister had died . . .</p>
<p><strong>17. int. examination room - late afternoon 17.</strong>: The
same room as before. The same woman. All that has changed is the light.
It’s late afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: According to the neighbors, she’s never set
foot outside her apartment, has no other living relatives, and has
always been the way she is now - without any comprehension or
response.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: And yet . . .</p>
<p><strong>dr. kaufman</strong>: A reflex.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: If she batted it away I might call that a
reflex. She doesn’t bat it away, she catches it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kaufman</strong>: - It’s still a reflex.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’m sorry, if you were right I’d agree with
you.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It’s as if . . . having lost all will of her
own on which to act, she borrows the will of the ball.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tyler</strong>: The “will of the ball?”</p>
<p><strong>dr. sullivan</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kaufman . i</strong>: You’re trying to make a good
impression. That’s it, isn’t it? You’re still settling in.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kaufman</strong>: Miss Costello, you’ll see that
Dr. Saver’s patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kaufman</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>18. ext. parking lot - bainbridge - late afternoon</strong>:
C’ Sayer climbs into his Toyota and, as he buckles his seat belt, -�
recites in a mumble to himself –</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: One . . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What’d I forget?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: I just wanted to say to you I
preferred your explanation.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: And that I’ll look after things for
you until you’ve “settled in.” Good night, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Thank you . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>19. int. sammy’s grotto, city island, the bronx - night
19.</strong>: Sayer at a table eating dinner alone. He should’ve brought
along something to read. He glances at the little “Catch of the Day”
notice on his table for the tenth time, then absently in at an eel in a
fish tank, which seems to be peering back out at him.</p>
<p><strong>sidney v.o.</strong>: I am not mad … not mad . . .</p>
<p><strong>20. ext. schoolyard &amp; bainbridge hospital - day
20.</strong>: A tether ball dangling from a rope, resting against a
pole. The chains of a swing. Pigeons scavenging scraps on the asphalt of
the elementary school playground, deserted.</p>
<p><strong>sidney v.o.</strong>: I know the difference between what is
real and what is not . . .</p>
<p><strong>21. int. sidney’s dayroom - day 21.</strong>: Tight on the
elderly man’s face.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: The voice was real.</p>
<p><strong>21.c0nt. 21.</strong>: Sayer nods in agreement though he is
not altogether as certain of tne claim. They are in a ward crowded with
many patients who are mad, obviously and irretrievably so.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What did the voice say?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: “Mr. Titch, get your coat and hat, go up to
the roof and jump off.”</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Did you recognize it as belonging to a
person? Or was it just a voice?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You don’t deny it was you.</p>
<p><strong>’ ’ � sayer ’ .</strong>: I do deny it. It wasn’t me. It
wasn’t real. We’ve only just now met, sir. �</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: If that’s true . . . I’m in a
predicament.</p>
<p><strong>22. int. staff cafeteria - bainbridge - day 22.</strong>:
Sayer in line with Drs. Tyler and Sullivan, both younger than himself.
He seems distracted, Sayer, lost in the color of the beets on his tray.
Or a thought. Like George telling Lenny again about the rabbits:</p>
<p><strong>22.cont. dr. tyler 22</strong>: fp � Aquarium in the waiting
room, George. ,</p>
<p><strong>dr. sullivan</strong>: We could have all that … but we’d miss
all this. We’d miss the wards.</p>
<p><strong>dr. tyler</strong>: The smell of them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sullivan</strong>: We’d miss this place - We’d miss this
. . . Whatever this is. .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Ye ….</p>
<p><strong>. ’ sayer</strong>: Yes . . . ,’</p>
<p><strong>23. int. sidney’s dayroom - day 23.</strong>: Sayer back with
Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Did you see me when-1 “spoke?”</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: You see me now though.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sid ne y</strong>: U nle ss you us e th e P .A. sy ste m.</p>

<p><strong>s ay e r</strong>: H ow ar e y ou ?</p>
<p><strong>26. int. leonard’s dayroom - later - day . 26.</strong>:
Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands before a
table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs. It is Lucy, the
one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement of nurses and other
patients only accentuates her stillness. Sayer considers her from all
angles as one considers an abstract art piece that baff les but in
trigues. Unlike the others, she’s on her feet. A nd unlike the others,
she seems, to Sayer, to have been headed somewhere before turning to
stone again. He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain
across the room. And that it’s the table, like a barrier, that has
arrested her progress. He moves the table. In what appears to be slow
motion, she takes a tiny step. And another. And another before
encountering and being “blocked” by an empty wheelchair. She stops.
Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path. She
continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before
mysteriously stopping again. Sayer studies the puzzle … there are no
longer any barriers in her way, but she’s not moving. Defeated, he goes
to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her. Across
the room, a man in a wheelchair, another “ghost” , stares through eyes
which seem more dead than alive. “At” Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>state of new york</strong>: A typed date / AUGUST 2, 1929.
The admitting physician’s name. The patient’s name. And age / 15. An
identification number and ward assignment number. As Sayer pulls the
folder and closes the drawer of one of several filing cabinets lining
the walls of a claustrophobic room, Miss Costello slides open another,
locates a particular folder in it and in the folder another admitting
form – The date / MAY 7, 1932. Names and numbers. Another drawer. Sayer
pulling another folder. Another admission form ~ Date / DECEMBER 12,
1930. Age of the patient / 22.</p>
<p><strong>28. int. examination room - later - day</strong>: The files
spread out on a table. Sayer and Miss Costello leafing through them. .
Sayer considers one’s original admission forms. He scans bodies of text
and finds a diagnosis – ATYPICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA. He sets it aside and
picks up another.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: “Atypical Hysteria,” this one.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: There must be more recent files we missed
somehow. “Part Twos” to their medical histories. In some other filing
cabinet somewhere. . ..</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: One would think that after a point enough
atypical somethings would amount to a typical something. But a typical
“what?”</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: , Doctor . . . would you like to g e
t a</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Ah . . . normally I’d say yes . . . only I’ve
made other plans . . .</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Some other time.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: ,</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>30. int. sammy’s grotto, city island - night 30.</strong>:
The tiny gree/i eyes in the head of the eel staring out at refracted
light and shadow. Sayer, alone at the same table as before, finished
with his meal.</p>

arrived, intrigued by its pictures. The parcel paper lies beside it on
the table.</p>
<p><strong>34. int. sayer’s house - living room - later - night
34.</strong>: Fingers on the keys of a baby grand piano that seems out
of scale with Sayer’s small living room. Wrapped in a robe, he plays a
melody. on nature itself,, botany, many first editions - two and three
deep on shelves, on the floor, on tables, stacked on the couch - and
chairs almost like figures of people.t</p>
<p><strong>35. int. sayer’s house - living room - later - night
35.</strong>: A lamp, on, in the living room. Sayer asleep on the couch,
an open book and reading glasses resting on his chest. His eyes blink
open. Not at a noise. At a thought.</p>

the lights on.</p>
<p><strong>36’.cont. 36.</strong>: Glancing up from files strewn across
the table, Sayer shares a discovery with the janitor -</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: They all survived encephalitis years before
they came here. In the 1920’ s .</p>
<p><strong>37. int. medical library, new york - day 37.</strong>: Sayer
displays what he has written on the back of his hand to</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: The New England Journal of Medicine, April
6th, 1935.</p>
<p><strong>38. int. medical library - later - day . 38.</strong>: A
microfilm machine. Sayer manipulating its levers and eventually finding
what he’s after, an article titled:</p>
<p><strong>encephalitis lethargica, ten years later.</strong>:
Accompanying the text are grainy black and white photographs taken in an
old operating theatre. An anatomical skeleton, a doctor in a white coat,
subjects– men, women and children with haunting eyes.</p>
<p><strong>39. ext. residential garden, new york - day 39.</strong>:
Close on the doctor from the photographs - ancient and ill.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Pus and pain, that’s the final reward.
Pus and pain and obscurity.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor .</strong>: I believe you when you say some still
live. But I can assure you they’re medically irrelevant. As they were
thirty years ago when I fought to get my work published.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: That’s the problem with a unique
disease. Once it no longer rages, I’m telling you, it becomes very
unfashionable. .</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: What would I be without this thing? A
man with a1 shred of dignity le_ft.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Should I get your nurse?</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: God forbid, no.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: How many have you found there?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Five. So far. I think there may be more.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: How are they?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: As you described them. As they were back
then. As “insubstantial as ghosts.” Only I guess most of them were
children then.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Yes. Children who fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Most died during the acute stage of the
illness, during a sleep so deep they couldn’t be roused. A sleep that in
most cases lasted several months.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Those who survived, who awoke, seemed
fine, as though nothing had happened. Years went by - five, ten, fifteen
- before anyone suspected they were not well. . They were not.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: I began to see them in the early 1930’s
- old people brought in by their children, young people brought in by
their parents - all of them complaining they weren’t “themselves”
anymore. They’d grown distant, aloof, anti-social, they daydreamed at
the dinner table. I referred them to psychiatrists.</p>
<p><strong>40.cont. doctor 40</strong>: 0&lt;</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What must it be like to be them?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What are they thinking? .</p>

<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Bec use . . .</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Because the alternative is
unthinkable.</p>
<p><strong>40a. int. dayroom - day ’ 40a.</strong>: The hand of a
stone-like woman catches the tennis ball while the rest of her remains
absolutely still. Sayer gestures to Anthony, Okay, and the orderly
wheels her out of the crowded room.</p>
<p><strong>4ob. int. ward 5 dayroom - day � 4ob</strong>: The hand of an
otherwise still-life man snaps to catch the ball. Sayer nods to an
orderly who wheels him out past younger patients, Ward 5’s
residents.</p>
<p><strong>40c. int. corridor - day 40c</strong>: The ball glances off
the face of a nan who turns in his wheelchair and glares at Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Sorry. .</p>
<p><strong>41. int. leonard’s dayroom - later - day</strong>: Sayer has
assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are
post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden
of stone. He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient. It
remains suspended, doll-like. He tries to follow the trajectory of
another’s gaze. It leads only to blank space. He considers another who
appears “deeply involved” in some minute and curious activity with his
twisted hands, a kind of tearing, shredding motion. Across the room,
paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and Lolly. He’s gently brushing
her hair. Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she
“draws” a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until
it reaches a “vanishing point” in the center.</p>
<p><strong>42. int. examination room - later - day 42.</strong>: The
results of standard perception tests scotch-taped to a wall of the
examination room. Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum,
consider each for a moment before moving onto the next. Printed in the
left column of each are a circle, square, triangle and daisy. In the
right are the post-encephalitics’ failed “attempts” to copy them.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: It’s different.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Quite. It’s quite bad.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Did he fail to understand? Or was he
unwilling to fail?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Could he be saying, “I can’t draw a triangle,
don’t make me”? Could it be willfully bad?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Which one is this?</p>
<p><strong>43. int. leonard’s ward - day 43.</strong>: The painting of
the Western town from the prologue - saloon, livery stable, sunset.
Below it, in his wheelchair, Leonard. His face is unlined and passive,
like a mask. His body is still, like the dead. Leonard’s mother, a woman
of seventy or so, is combing her son’s hair, being careful to get the
part straight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Of course not. Not in words.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: He speaks to you in other ways. How do you
mean? You don’t have children.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: No. ,</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: If you did you’d know.</p>
<p><strong>43a. int. leonard’s dayroom - continuous - day 43a</strong>:
Sayer, trailing after Mrs. Lowe and her sonr becomes momentarily
distracted by Lucy, the most recently arrived post- encephalitic, the
one he tried unsuccessfully to coax to the drinking fountain. She is
there again, “stuck” at the same point, angled toward the fountain but
unable to reach it. Sayer brings her a cup of water and rejoins
Mrs. Lowe. -</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’d like to examine him again-if that’s all
right with you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe ,</strong>: He did well.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: In a sense.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He’s very clever. Aren’t you, Leonard.
.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Does this mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe .</strong>: ;�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Well it’s abstract, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: That’s the problem with all you doctors,
you have no imagination. Everything has to be real to you.</p>
<p><strong>44. int. mrs. lowe’s apartment - night 44</strong>: The door
opens from the inside revealing Sayer in street clothes. Judging from
the look on Mrs. Lowe’s face, he has arrived unannounced.</p>
<p><strong>sayer .</strong>: I want to know more about him.</p>
<p><strong>44a. int. mrs. lowe’s apartment - leonard’s bedroom - night
44a.</strong>: An old photograph. A sixth grade class picture from
1930?, Moving slowly across the young faces to Leonard, eleven, at the
end of a row.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe 0.8.</strong>: Something was wrong, they said, with
his hands. He couldn’t write anymore, he couldn’t do the work, I should
take him out of school, they said. He was eleven.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He slowly got worse. He’d be talking,
suddenly he’d come to a stop. After a few seconds he’d finish what he
was saying like nothing happened, but these standstills got longer.
Sometimes he’d call to me and I’d come in and find him at his desk in a
trance. An hour, two hours. Then he’d be okay again.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: One day I came hone from work and found
him in his bed, his arm like this, reaching. “What do you want,
Leonard?”</p>
<p><strong>mr.s lowe</strong>: He never spoke again. It was like he’d
disappeared. I took him to Bainbridge later that year. November
fourteenth, 1937. He was twenty.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What’d he do with himself, Mrs. Lowe, those
nine years he stayed in this room?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He read. y</p>
<p><strong>45. int. examination room - bainbridge - day 45</strong>:
Leonard’s face in shadow. Wires emerging from his scalp. A sluggish EEG
pattern. A blinding flash from a strobe.suddenly lights up the room. The
pupils of Leonard’s eyes shrink, but his EEG remains stuporously
slow.</p>
<p><strong>46. int. research lab - day 46</strong>: A monkey flipping
switches on a panel built into a laboratory room, searching for a
sequence. In an observation booth, years of collected data - charts and
graphs, EEG’s and notes.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: When you say you’re working with people, you
don’t mean living people.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Living people, yes. Patients.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It’s in The Bronx. It’s a poor private
chronic hospital called M ou nt –</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: Oh, Malcolm, Malcolm, come back, come on.
You’re a benchman, you’re no clinician, why would you lower
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: How’s Hank?</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: How’s Hank? He’s great, he’s brilliant, look
at him.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: A physician? You?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Subtract two seconds off his time.</p>
<p><strong>48. int. research lab - later - day 48</strong>: Rats in
cages, wired up, manipulating elaborate series of ladders and pulleys,
traversing catwalks, or ratwalks, leading to glucose rewards. While
Mann, with something less than great enthusiasm, considers an EEG Sayer
has brought, his monkey drags toys over to Sayer and tries to engage him
in play. One of the toys is an Ouija Board.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. It’s for his
alphabet lessons. We’re busy, Hank, go play solitaire.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: Asleep. First stage normal. Second a little
dull. Normal</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: He shrugs, lays out a second EEG, and gestures at
patterns on it –</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: Awake. Slightly erratic. No more so than a lot
of people walking the streets of New York. I give up, what’s wrong with
him?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: You have them backwards. This is him awake .
. . This is him asleep. .-,” - . ^ �</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: This is him awake? This is him asleep?</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: What are you saying? When he’s awake, what,
he’s dreaming?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: When there’s any brain activity at all, which
is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: And when he’s asleep . . . ?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: When he’s asleep he manages to create a kind
of reality. What we might call reality.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: That’s what you think these say?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: 1 don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mann</strong>: What’s this peak? Strobe?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: No. This is the strobe.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: This . . . . . . is me saying his name to
him.</p>
<p><strong>49. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 49</strong>: Tight on
Leonard. Something blurs past him but his eyes don’t follow it. Pulling
back, the object blurs by again from the other direction. Tight on
Sayer. The thing blurs past his face. His eyes don’t follow it either.
Pulling back, it blurs again.</p>
<p><strong>50. int. examination room - day 50.</strong>: Sayer alone in
the examination room, tired, at its window staring blankly out. His
perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned couches,
refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses. And beyond the lot, the
elementary school playground. Laughing children on swings and slides.
Jumping rope. Batting tether balls. Playing hopscotch. Moving slowly in
on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl tossing a bean bag into a
square. Jumping over it and into the next square. Turning and jumping
back. Balancing on one foot. Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down
again. Into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the
asphalt.</p>
<p><strong>51. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 51.</strong>: From above,
patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white checkerboard
linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The pattern is regular to a point
but then breaks up – is interrupted by an area of solid white, where a
wall once stood – before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow
“sea,” the white area, on either side of which lies “land.”</p>
<p><strong>52. int. dayroom - day</strong>: A soap opera on a portable
black and white TV in a narrow passageway of a nurses’ station.
Beyond.it, beyond a glass partition, a crowded idle dayroom. Miss
Costello crosses into and out of view and reappears moments later next
to the TV. She switches it off and turns to face the three RNs who were
watching it. In their defense –</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The patients have all been given their
morning medication.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Good. Dr. Sayer was hoping you’d have
some free time.</p>
<p><strong>53. int. dayroom - later - day 53</strong>: The nurse holds
the book like it’s something quite foreign to her. She finds the
beginning of the first chapter, clears her throat, and reads –</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: “Call me . . . Ish-ma-el . . .</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: “Some years ago, never mind how long
precisely, having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see
the watery part of the world . . .”</p>
<p><strong>54. int. examination room - day</strong>: Leonard’s head
locked on his shoulders at an improbable angle that forces his entranced
gaze upward to a point well above Sayer.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Can you hear me, Leonard? I want to hear you
speak your name. : . -</p>
<p><strong>55. int. sayer’s house - morning ” 55</strong>: Tight on
Sayer pulling record albums from his extensive classical collection.</p>
<p><strong>56. int. dayroom - day 56</strong>: An.old box-style
phonograph. The kind whose top is also a detachable speaker. An orderly,
Fernando, dusts it off, rigs it, takes the record Miss Costello holds
out to him, gets it spinning, and sets the needle down. Opera music. For
the “enjoyment” of two more post- encephalitics. The eyes of one narrow
slightly, almost imperceptibly. -.</p>
<p><strong>57. int. examination room - day 57</strong>: The keys of
Sayer’s old manual Underwood typewriter. And Leonard’s claw of a hand
hanging over them like one of those unmanageable penny arcade
cranes.</p>
<p><strong>sayer 57</strong>: L . . . Leonard . . . L . . .</p>
<p><strong>58. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 58.</strong>: Under Miss
Costello’s supervision, maintenance men remove the gratings from the
windows and washhthe panes.</p>
<p><strong>int.- dayroom - day 59.</strong>: 59. 30’s jazz music. The
orderly from before with “his” two post- encephalitics. Each has a tray
of cafeteria food, but only one is eating, and mechanically at that.
&lt;</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: . . . not just any music, it has to be the
right, music for them. Jazz does nothing for Bert. Only Rose. It’s like
they’re only moved by music that moves them. I’m that w ay .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes, so am I. &gt;</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: I haven’t found anything that moves Bert
yet.</p>
<p><strong>59a. int. corridor - day ’ 59a.</strong>: A ” no r ma l” pa t

<p><strong>sayer</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>ms woman</strong>: I wish I had something like that.
SSmething that would interest you instead of this stupid boring MS.</p>
<p><strong>60. int. examination room - day 6</strong>: Leonard in his
wheelchair, absolutely motionless. Sayer behind the lens of the 8mm
camera on the tripod. Drs. Tyler and Sullivan, at the doorway, watch
with some amusement.</p>
<p><strong>60a. int. dayroom - day 60a</strong>: Miss Costello wheels
the man who shreds invisible things to a window and places a piece of
toast from a tray into his hands. He tears at it, the crumbs sailing out
onto a landing, and a flock of pigeons swoops up.</p>
<p><strong>61. int. dayroom - day 61</strong>: Three post-encephalitics
with cards in their hands and the best poker faces you ever saw. :</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: They’ll sit there all day like that if I
let them. I have to play the first card.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Is it a real game I wonder?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: If it is, I don’t know it. Maybe it’s
three different games.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>63. int. corridor / dayroom - day 6</strong>: Sayer moving
past “normal” patients lined up in the hall like planes on tarmac.
Suddenly, from a dayroom, booms the opening bass line of Hendrix’s “Foxy
Lady.”</p>

<p><strong>68. int. leonard’s ward - later - night 68.</strong>: In a
far corner of the darkened ward, in a pool of lamp light, two
silhouetted figures. Sayer and Leonard. Sleeping patients all around
them. Sayer carefully, awkwardly, places his hand on Leonard’s. After a
moment, the contact brings the useless appendage “to life.” As it slowly
turns over and grasps the doctor’s hand, a glimmer of life seems to
appear in Leonard’s eyes as well. Sayer, unfamiliar, it seems, with the
feeling the contact produces in him, nonetheless places his other hand
on Leonard’s other. Soon it too turns and holds onto Sayer’s. The doctor
draws both of Leonard’s hands toward him and sets them down on the
pointer of an Ouija Board.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’ll begin moving the pointer toward the “L.”
For “Leonard.” Once I feel you beginning to move it, I’ll stop and
you’ll take . over. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’m beginning . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes, good . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: No. No, I didn’t make myself clear. My fault.
I . . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer ’ “.,</strong>: No. No, I . . . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes. Yes. That’s what I meant. . “L.” Good.
Now the “E.”</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: . . . you’re spelling something el e . .
.</p>
<p><strong>69. int. examination room - night</strong>: Sayer alone in
the examining room, standing over his desk. The lab coat is on it. And
on it is scrawled:</p>
<p><strong>rilkespantherilke</strong>: He has to study it only a moment
before he sees the meaning of it; he quickly scratches out the last four
letters,and adds a slash between the “S” and the “P,” so that it
reads:</p>
<p><strong>70. int. public library - day ’ 7</strong>: A card catalogue.
Cards flipping by, stopping on one that .reads:</p>
<p><strong>71. int. public library - later - day . ., 7</strong>: Moving
slowly in on Sayer at one of the library tables with a V . book. ,

<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: “His gaze from staring through the

into the Western painting.</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: “For him it is as though there were a
thousand bars, and behind the thousand bars, no world . . .</p>
<p><strong>72a. ext. bronx zoo - day 72a.</strong>: Moving in on a
panther, limbs weakened, spirit broken, slowly pacing back and forth
before the bars of a small cage.</p>
<p><strong>sayer v.o.</strong>: “As he paces in cramped circles, over
and over, his powerful strides are like a ritual dance around a center
where a great will stands paralyzed . . .</p>
<p><strong>73. int. leonard’s ward - day 73.</strong>: Moving slowly in
on Leonard as, in bed, flannel pajamas, as his mother diapers him for
the night.</p>
<p><strong>sayer v.o.</strong>: “At times the curtains of the eye lift
without a sound . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer v.o.</strong>: “. . . and a shape enters, ’.slips thr

<p><strong>73a. ext. auditorium - new york - afternoon 73a.</strong>:
Professional and professorial types filing in past a placard, an
enlargement of an article from the Journal of Neurochemistry titled:
LEVADOPA IN THE TREATMENT OF PARKINSONISM. Below it:</p>
<p><strong>a discussion with martin s. thomas, ph.d.</strong>: There’s
excitement in the air.</p>
<p><strong>74. int. auditorium - afternoon 74</strong>: An anatomical
skeleton dangling from a metal stand.</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: There’s an ordinary medicine with
which we are all familiar. An everyday medicine of stubbed toes and
bunions and boils.</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: And then there is another kind. A
medicine that holds out to the afflicted the promise of restored
life.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Thank you. Yes. Yes, I’m very much interested
in your work with this drug. I’m curious if . . .</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: Doctor …?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Sayer. I’m curious if you . . .</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: After I’m through, Dr. Sayer. If you
wouldn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>75. int. auditorium lobby - later - afternoon 75,</strong>:
Refreshments on tables. Sayer, uncomfortable in his suit, wandering
around the crowded room with a glass of wine. He approaches its hub of
activity, the neurochemist surrounded by several impressed colleagues,
but can’t manage to get close enough to speak with him.</p>
<p><strong>76. int. men’s room, auditorium - later - afternoon
7</strong>: The neurochemist walks in and crosses to the urinals. A
moment later, he hears the door opening, and footsteps, and then
nothing, until –</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Do you think it’s possible that simple
Parkinsonian tremor taken to its furthest extreme could appear as no
tremor at all?</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: Are you speaking to me?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: If jail the compulsions in the Parkinson’s
patient were somehow accelerated - - the hands, the shaking, the tics,
the head bobbing, the quickening speech - - might they not cave in on
themselves and, in effect, turn the person into stone?</p>
<p><strong>neurochemist</strong>: Dr. Sayer, yes? I’m a chemist, doctor.
I leave it to you guys to do the damage.</p>
<p><strong>77. ext. parking lot - bainbridge - morning 77</strong>:
Emerging from his car with some papers, Dr. Kaufman is ambushed by

<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Freud believed in miracles. Prescribing
cocaine like it was candy . . .</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: We all believed in the “miracle” of
Cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it. Now it’s L-Dopa.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: With all due respect, I think it’s rather too
soon to say that.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: With all due “respect,” it’s rather way too
soon. Let the chemists do the damage.</p>
<p><strong>77a. int. kaufman’s office - later - morning 77a</strong>:
The stack of papers drops onto Kaufman’s desk. The one on top reads, NEW
DRUG LETS SHAKING PALSY PATIENTS EAT JELL-O.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Did you read the case - the husband who came
home to find his wife singing. She hadn’t felt like singing in
years.</p>
<p><strong>77a.cont. kaufman 77a.</strong>: I read them all. Soberly.
All thirty cases had mild Parkinson’s. Your Parkies - if that’s what
they are - haven’t moved for decades. You know better than to make a
leap like that, you want to believe there’s a connection, that doesn’t
mean there is one.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What I believe, what I know, is that these
people are alive inside.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: How do you know? Because they catch tennis
balls?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: r..iiJi! And what if this drug were to</p>
<p><strong>sayer -</strong>: &gt;</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: How many did you think I ’ d let you put on
it?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: All of them … some of them … one of them . .
.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: One. With the family’s consent. Signed.</p>
<p><strong>77a.cont. kaufman 77a.</strong>: Sayer -</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That “immense” project of yours. The
myelin? The worms? When that failed, what was the reaction of your lab
supervisor? �</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: He asked me to leave. .</p>
<p><strong>kaufman .</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>78. int. mrs. lowe’s apartment - night 78.</strong>: :</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: People with ordinary Parkinson’s Disease
sometimes complain that they’ve “lost their grace . . .” They have to
think about the things we just do . . . It has to do with a chemical in
the midbrain, or rather the lack of it, called dopamine. L-Dopa
replenishes this dopamine, making it possible for these patients to move
more naturally.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Leonard has Parkinson’s Disease?</p>
<p><strong>78.cont. sayer</strong>: No. No, his symptoms … are like
Parkinsons … and then again they’re not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Then what will this medicine dp. for
him?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I don’t know what it’ll do for him, if
anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: What do you think it will do?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: What db&lt; you hope it will do?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I hope it’ll bring him back from wherever he
is.</p>
<p>****: To what?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: To the world.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: What’s here for him after all these
years? ’</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: You are here.</p>
<p><strong>79. int. pharmacy, bainbridge - day</strong>: The hospital
pharmacy, a subterranean structure built into the basement, cluttered
from floor to ceiling with medicines. Ray, the pharmacist, dips into a
bag of powder. He spoons some out onto a scale and looks to Sayer to
tell him the dosage.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I have no idea. What do you say we ease into
it with … what, � . fifty milligrams?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Let’s say a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>80. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 80</strong>: Leonard,
sphinx-like in his wheelchair, his mother by his side. Sayer, stirring
the L-Dopa into a paper cup of orange juice. Miss Costello, in the
doorway, watching. Sayer hands the glass to Mrs. Lowe. v</p>
<p>****: Consult w/Sacks on this; may need the contents of a ’ - ‘-’</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard? Your mother’s going to give you some
juice. There’s medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than
usual.</p>
<p><strong>81. int. the pharmacy, later - day 81.</strong>: Ray
measuring out another 100 milligram dose.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe the acid in the orange juice, neutralized
it.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Or maybe it’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’ll try it in milk.</p>
<p><strong>82. int. leonard’s ward - night 82.</strong>: An empty milk
glass on a night table. ” Leonard, in his wheelchair, in pajamas, still
and silent under the painting of the boat. His mother, Sayer and Miss
Costello watch and wait while around them nurses atid orderlies hoist
other patients into bed.</p>
<p><strong>83. int. the pharmacy - day 83.</strong>: Ray scrapes powder
from the scale into a pharmaceutical funnel which takes it down onto a
miniature glass dish. Handing the dis h to Say er – ;</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Five hundred milligrams.</p>
<p><strong>84. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 84.</strong>: Another empty
milk glass. Leonard, stoic, or so it seems, in his wheelchair. His
mother and Sayer and Miss Costello waiting for a movement, a change of
expression, a sign of any kind that something is happening inside him.
But there’s nothing . . .</p>
<p><strong>85. int. bainbridge - night 85.</strong>: A corridor.
Mrs. Lowe is leaving. Sayer is with her, seeing her to the door.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’ll call if there’s any change.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>86. int. leonard’s ward - night 86.</strong>: Sayer and Miss
Costello lift Leonard out of his wheelchair and into his bed.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: I’m going home too. If you need me .
�</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes, I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>87. int. the pharmacy - night 87.</strong>: Ray has
gonejhome, too. Sayer, alone in the pharmacy, measures out 1000
milligrams, ten times the original dose.</p>
<p><strong>88. int. leonard’s ward - night 88.</strong>: Sayer at
Leonard’s bedside, holding the glass to Leonard’s lips, draining the
liquid into him, all of it.</p>
<p><strong>89. int. leonard’s ward - later - night . 8</strong>: Sayer
asleep in the wheelchair. He stirs. Wakes. And takes a moment to remind
himself where he is. And why. His eyes narrow, uncomprehending.
Leonard’s bed is empty.</p>
<p><strong>90. int. dayroom - later - night</strong>: A claw of a hand
dragging a crayon across a sheet of paper. Tight on Sayer, framed in a
doorway, as still and silent and entranced as a post-encephalitic. His
perspective of the dayroom – deserted except for a figure, a patient,
Leonard, hunched over the table. As Sayer crosses toward him, Leonard’s
head slowly rises. Sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other
in silence for several moments. Leonard struggles to speak, to form
words. They come out in a halting cadence, flat, without inflection, and
are only barely . recognizable as words: .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It’s quiet.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It’s late. Everyone’s asleep�&gt;</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m not asleep?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: No. You’re awake.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>91. int. examination room - dawn 91</strong>: Alone in the
room, Leonard moves slowly around it, feeling things: the smoothness of
the cabinet glass/ the warmth thrown by a desk lamp, water from the
cooler splashing onto his hand.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Your mother is here.</p>
<p><strong>92. int. corridor - morning .92.</strong>: :</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: My name is Elizabeth. It’s a �
pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>9.3. int. another corridor - morning</strong>: Miss Costello,
flanked by Sayer and Mrs. Lowe, watches as Leonard extends his hand to
the “card playing nurse.”</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: How do you do, sir? My name is
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Fernando. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: Great, man. How’re you?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Great, too.</p>
<p><strong>95. int. the pharmacy - morning</strong>: Fernando is along
for the ride and watches Leonard shaking Ray the pharmacist’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Lowe?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: !</p>
<p><strong>95a. int. cafeteria kitchen -morning</strong>: The cooks and
kitchen workers around Leonard and his entourage, shaking his hand.</p>
<p><strong>96. int. staff cafeteria - later - day 9</strong>: A tray of
truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer and Miss Costello,
watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush- like concoction and
manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into his mouth. He seems amazed
by its flavor.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It’s delicious.</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: I wouldn’t go that far, Len.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: I don’t think I could deal with
losing 3D years of my life. I can’t even imagine it.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: He does realize it, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: He must.</p>
<p>****: Sayer demonstrates a clapping motion. Leonard repeats it more
slowly but with decent motor control.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Splendid.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Can I see you walk the length of the
room?</p>
<p><strong>99. int. leonard’s ward - night 99.</strong>: Sayer and
Mrs. Lowe at Leonard’s bedside.</p>
<p><strong>l eo n ar d</strong>: I ’ m af r ai d to cl os e m y ey e s .
. . If</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: . . . you’ll sleep. And when you wake up in
the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>100. int. room adjacent to examination room - morning
100.</strong>: Sayer comes in with some books, sets them on Miss
Costello’s desk and crosses to a closet.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I didn’t sleep, did you?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Does it look like it? .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Do you know if Leonard’s awake?</p>
<p><strong>101. int. the examination room - morning 101.</strong>:
Showered and shaved and groomed and bright-eyed, Leonard sits listening
to his own heartbeat with Sayer’s stethoscope. Coming in –</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Good morning. .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Been waiting for me long?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Some things have happened while you’ve been
away. I thought you’d be interested.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: You don’t have to read them now, Leonard.
They’re yours. At your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I used to read quite a lot. Before. Yes, I
know. .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Thank you for these.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Have you thought about what you’d like to do
today?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’m not sure I can arrange that.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Let’s approach it this way. What . “.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’d like to go outside.</p>
<p><strong>101a. ext. bainbridge hospital - day 101a</strong>: Sayer and
Leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees along a path
toward the parking lot. At a point, the doctor realizes his patient is
no longer at his side; he’s several steps back, feeling the sunshine on
his skin.</p>
<p><strong>102. ext. parking lot, bainbridge - morning 102</strong>:
Though it is only a Toyota, its dashboard, to Leonard, resembles
something out of Jules Verne. He allows Sayer to buckle his seatbelt for
him and watches with fascination as Sayer performs the “complex”
preparatory sequence necessary, apparently, to make the car go. The car
pulls away. Above, framed in a second story window of one of the
buildings, stands a lone figure looking out – Leonard’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>103. int. sayer’s car - moving - morning 103</strong>: Tight
on the radio. Sayer switches it on. To Leonard’s amazement, classical
music fills the interior</p>
<p><strong>104. ext. the bronx - moving shots - morning 104</strong>:
Billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers. Buses
which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale. “Ultra-modern”
housing projects and gas stations. “Futuristic” cars. Leonard cannot
imagine a more enthralling re-introduction to the world and stares at it
all with wonder. Everywhere he looks there is something
“extraordinary.”</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What a wonderful place The Bronx has
become.</p>
<p><strong>105. int/ext. new york botanical gardens - day 105</strong>:
A rose. , Leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance.
He touches its petals gently, explores them, and is quietly astonished
by the tactile sensation. Sayer watches. He, too, can appreciate wonders
of the real world, especially those of a botanical nature, but not with,
the purity or intensity Leonard can. Pulling back reveals them in the
middle of a vast garden of countless thousands of roses.</p>
<p><strong>106. int. sayer’s car - moving - day 106</strong>: Leonard
turns the radio dial from the classical station to another playing a
very different kind of music, and listens to it bemused but intrigued.
It’s John Lennon singing “A DAY IN</p>
<p><strong>the life”</strong>: and it CONTINUES OVER:</p>
<p><strong>107. ext. park - the bronx - later - day 107</strong>:
Children playing flag-football on an expanse of grass. Dogs running
around, nannies with prams, lovers. A disk, a frisbee, falls at
Leonard’s feet. He retrieves it but has no idea what it is or what to do
with it. Sayer demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one.
Leonard doesn’t get it. Sayer takes it from him and flings it
pathetically not halfway back to its owners. The music CONTINUES
OVER:</p>
<p><strong>108. ext. street corner joint - the bronx - later - day
108.</strong>: Leonard watches with interest a Carvel ice cream machine.
He and Sayer are handed cones and Leonard’s attention moves to a girl
wearing an unbelievably short skirt. Her boyfriend stares at Leonard.
Sayer tries to pull his charge’s attention elsewhere. Leonard, finally,
glances away, up, to a sound overhead. The music CONTINUES OVER:</p>
<p><strong>109. ext. kennedy airport - day</strong>: A 747 roaring down
a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off and thunders over Sayer and
Leonard and the parked Toyota. Exhilerated, Leonard waves. The music
CONTINUES OVER:</p>
<p><strong>111. ext. the bronx / city island - day 111</strong>: An
expressway. The Toyota traveling at “astounding” speed, passing a sign
that reads CITY ISLAND.</p>
<p><strong>112. int. sayer’s kitchen / dining room - day 112.</strong>:
Tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter. Sayer,
exhausted from the day, hunts in vain through packing boxes on the floor
for crackers, cookies, something he can offer his guest. He keeps
glancing in at Leonard, who’s wandering around the dining room,
navigating around packing boxes, to browse at the spines of books.
Noticing Sayer watching -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You just moved here.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yeah. Well, five years ago. ,</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Your son?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Me, actually.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You seem uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I probably was.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Each has a specific purpose.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Those are my normal interior glasses. And
spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one.
Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for
close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses -</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: That’s heavy-gauge metal so when I fall
asleep and roll over on them I don’t wreck them. They’re
indestructible.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: As long as I pretty much know ahead of time
what I’ll be looking ’ at, it works out, I don’t have to carry all five
pairs around.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What if you just want to go for a walk?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Walks are a problem. Walks are the hardest
thing. You just never know.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I hope you’ll forgive the inelegant
presentation. I don’t entertain much. �/� .</p>
<p><strong>113. int. sayer’s living room - day</strong>: They’ve cleared
places on the sofa and chair and sit there</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I can date my interest in science precisely,
actually. I’d been sent off to boarding school - a place perhaps not
quite as Dickensian as I remember it - when I happened to come across
the periodic table of elements. I memorized it. Which I admit was a
rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do. And I remember
feeling . . . not so much a sense of accomplishment . . . as comfort.
The halogens were what they were. The alkali metals were what they were.
Each element had its place, and nothing could change that. They were
secure, no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: :</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’m not terribly good with people. I like
them. I wish I could say I had more than a rudimentary understanding of
them. Maybe if they were less unpredictable . . .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Eleanor would disagree with you.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: -~ Eleanor? ^r LEONARD</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Oh, yes, of course. She’s spoken to you about
me?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>leonard ’</strong>: That you’re a kind man. That you care
very much for people.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: But you meant normal people.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: We should be getting back.</p>
<p><strong>114a. ext. parking lot - bainbridge - day 114a.</strong>:
Climbing out of his car, Kaufman sees Sayer striding toward him. He
glances to the sky, Kaufman, to God, and silently complains to Him.</p>
<p><strong>115. int. staff cafeteria, bainbridge - later - day
115</strong>: Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the
kitchen. Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with
finished’ meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and
Kaufman at a table near the door.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: z^ When you say expensive, what are</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: That would be for how long?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: About a month.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: A month?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I can’t go before the board with that. I
could . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I was thinking of speaking to the
patrons.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: The few patrons this hospital has give what
they can.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Well, we’d have to convince them to give more
than theyre accustomed to giving.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I think you overestimate the effect
Mr. Lowe has on people. We’re talking about money here.</p>
<p><strong>116. int. board room - night 116</strong>: 8mm film of
Leonard before L-Dopa – a wide shot of him absolutely motionless in his
wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: There was extreme rigidity of the axial
musculature . . . only vague available motion in the neck . . . no
voluntary movement in the limbs . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Perhaps most striking was the profound
facial masking – which we now know should not have been confused with
apathy.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Virtually aphonic, Mr. Lowe could articulate
no words, but rather only, with considerable effort, an occasional
noise, a kind of, “h .. .”</p>
<p><strong>a �</strong>: In the darkness sit Kaufman, the rest of the
Board of Directors, some elderly patrons of the hospital, and, near
Sayer, Miss Costello. She hands him a scribbled note. “Less scientific”
it reads.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Isolated circumstances – the mention of his
name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human
being – managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings
were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: The rest of the time he remained in a
profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and
happening and self – encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical
if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: This was his condition when first seen by me
in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the
last 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: Whenever you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been
explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . .
.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>117. int. board room, later - night 117</strong>: The lights
are on, the screen rolled up, the board members and patrons visibly
moved, almost shaken, and silent. Eventually one of the patrons, an old
woman, reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another
patron, an elderly man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket
pocket. Another already has hers out in front of her … Sayer and Miss
Costello exchange a glance. The room is absolutely silent, except for
the muted scratch of pens on paper.</p>
<p><strong>118. int. the pharmacy - day</strong>: The raw L-Dopa powder,
20,000 dollars worth, has arrived. It sits on a pharmacy counter in
large clear bags. Sayer and Ray peer between racks of medicine at two
teenage girls and two very old men chatting in a corner of the
pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They’re volunteers from the : neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>120. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 120.</strong>: Several
empty medicine paper-cups. The “garden of stone,” reassembled. Sayer
knows better than to sit and wait, that nothing is going to immediately
happen, but he sits and waits anyway. As does Miss Costello. As does
Leonard and his mother.</p>
<p><strong>121. int. staff room - night . 121</strong>: Sayer asleep on
a couch that’s too short for him. Miss Costello asleep on another.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dr. Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>night nurse</strong>: It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>121a. int. corridor - night 121a.</strong>: i</p>
<p><strong>122. int. leonard’s ward - moments later - night</strong>:
They appear at the threshold, Sayer, Miss Costello, the night nurse, the
others, and peer into the darkened room: In the quiet, in the shadows,
in the moonlight filtering in through the windows, the
post-encephalitics are emerging from their “cocoons,” rising from the
“dead” like Lazarus from the earth, reborn. Moving slowly past the beds:
A figure rediscovering the feeling of her skin; another, the sound of
his breath; another,’ the beating of her heart. A figure still asleep .
. . wakes. And for the first time in nearly half a century sees herself
in the world. Tight on Sayer, on the look of awe on his face as he
stares at the scene going on in the darkened ward. His glance finds
Leonard who is sitting up in his bed, smiling.</p>
<p><strong>123. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 123,</strong>: Tight on
Lucy’s face, deep in thought, lost in thought. After several moments of
silence, she speaks -</p>
<p><strong>.,:, � . :… . ,.lucy v . .� .-.. .</strong>: . . . I just had
the strapgest dream . . .</p>
<p><strong>123.cont. nurse 12</strong>: Miriam, please, I -</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I’ve been sitting for 25 years, you missed
your chance.</p>
<p><strong>orderly 1</strong>: You’re Italian, he’s Italian, what’s the
problem?</p>
<p><strong>orderly 2</strong>: I was born here - X don’t speak �
Italian.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: I want a steak, rare. I want mashed potatoes
and gravy, string beans, a slice of pie and a ’ chocolate phosphate.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: I think I prefer them the other way.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And some dye. Black.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Black, are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And some clothes . . . my. clothes.</p>
<p><strong>123.cont. - 123</strong>: Sh e p ull s at he r f ade d s hape

<p><strong>frank &lt;</strong>: M y wi fe a nd s on . A re th ey w el

<p><strong>123.cont. 123.</strong>: Hiss Costello finds herself at a
loss for a moment . . .</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: We’ll find them for you. We’ll track
them down.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: . . . I called to my sister, but she couldn’t
hear me. No one could hear me. I was alone . . . And then I woke up.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Lucy, what year is it?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What year is it? You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: �26.</p>
<p><strong>miriam o.s.</strong>: DoctorI Doctor! .</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: I walked all the way over there. And back.
What a perfect day.</p>
<p><strong>123b. int- corridor - same time - day 123b.</strong>: The
corridor, and the sound of a woman’s voice, very faint, . from somewhere
unseen:</p>
<p><strong>paula o.s.</strong>: ” . . . Like crowds storming the
Bastille …</p>
<p><strong>129. int.’post-encephalitic dayroom - continued - morning
129.</strong>: Sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the
faces of the awakened post-encephalitics and staff. He spots Sayer,
seated with a woman, her back to him and the door. She slowly turns to
look over her shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>lolly</strong>: Hi, Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hi. i</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Is it real . . . or . . .</p>
<p><strong>123b.cont. , 123b</strong>: Leonard, moving along the
corridor with Saver’s camera and tripod slows and listens:</p>
<p><strong>paula o.s.</strong>: . . . the Mighty Mets stormed</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: “Released from bondage and ridicule after
seven destitute seasons, they raised the roof of Shea Stadium - while
their fans attempted to dismantle it - in one of the loudest, wildest
victory celebrations in baseball : history -” ._</p>
<p><strong>129. int. leonard’s dayroom - continued - day 1</strong>:
Sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the faces of the
awakened post-encephalitics and staff. He spots Sayer, seated with a
woman, her back to him and the door. She slowly turns to look over her
shoulder and, seeing Sidney, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>lolly</strong>: Hi, Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>129.cont. 129</strong>: He smiles and crosses toward her, but
by the time he reaches her the smile has disappeared. Something
troubling has occurred to him. He looks to Sayer and whispers –</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Is it real … or . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: As real as real can be.</p>
<p><strong>130. int. corridor - another day 13</strong>: Sidney and
Lolly emerge from the dayroom, followed by the other post-encephalitics.
They’re all wearing suits and dresses and walk with purpose past
wheelchair-bound patients with “uninteresting” diseases. As they wait
for the elevator, Leonard wanders slightly down the corridor to see if
the girl is there again reading in the crafts area. The chair she was in
is empty.</p>
<p><strong>130a. int. elevator &amp; corridor - moments later - day
130</strong>: The elevator door slides open revealing them. Paula,
inside, hesitates: the sight is almost surreal. &gt;As they crowd in,
she wedges out, and down the hall, Leonard watching after her.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Len - come on.</p>
<p><strong>131. ext. bainbridge -same day 13</strong>: They’re going on
a field trip. As they’re escorted onto an idling hospital bus, Leonard,
outside it, tries to reason with his mother:</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Sidney’s going.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: He’s a patient, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: C -j He’s not the same kind of
patient.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: He’s still a patient. You’re not a
patient.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: I’m your mother.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Wait a minute. What on earth have you
done to your hair?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: There’s your bus. .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’ve decided not to go.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m staying here.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Nothing. Wave.</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: ’ Let’s go, already.</p>
<p><strong>131.c0nt. . 131</strong>: As the public bus pulls away,
Leonard pats Sayer on the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’ll see you later, have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>132. int. museum of natural history - new york -
day</strong>: Moving slowly toward a herd of still and silent elephants
in a cavernous, darkened room. As a nun counts the heads of parochial
school children filing past the huge beasts, Miss Costello counts the
heads of the post-encephalitics. Both come up short and glance
frantically around.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Dr. Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>132a. int. another room - natural history museum - day
132a.</strong>: A lifeless polar bear in a diorama “stares” out at Sayer
who’s peering in, intrigued. Miss Costello appears at his side.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: It’s very hard to keep everyone
together, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Has someone wandered off?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>132a.cont. 1</strong>: .,-&gt;, She leads him away by the
arm.</p>
<p><strong>133. int. sidney’s dayroom - same day 13</strong>: A dayroom
thick with inactivity. And the voice:</p>
<p><strong>paula o.s.</strong>: “From the sleek skyscrapers of Wall
Street where a tickertape blizzard filled the sky . . .</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: ” . . . to the undistinguished bars of a
hundred neighborhoods, New York yesterday went pleasantly mad over the
World Champion Mets . . .</p>
<p><strong>133a. int. patients’ cafeteria - later - day 133</strong>:
Paula moving along the serving line with a tray. Leonard, next in line,
moving along with his tray, a little too close. He steals a glance.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You following me?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m kidding. I’m sorry. I saw you upstairs .
. . just now.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Visiting someone?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No. �</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You work here.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You’re a patient?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You don’t look like a patient.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>134. int. patients’ cafeteria- later - day</strong>: Leonard
and Paula at a table. At other tables are patients who do look like
patients.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I don’t know if he knows I visit him or not.
I don’t know that he knows who I am. My mother doesn’t think so. She
doesn’t; come around any more–</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: But you do.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Sometimes I think I see something. I think I
see a change. And for a second, I see him like he was . . .</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Does that make any sense?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: s</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>134.cont.</strong>: He doesn’t know how to begin to explain
it to her.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: ’ I receive medication. , She waits for
more, but it doesn’t come. Only a smile.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: , I’m okay now.</p>
<p><strong>136. int. natural history museum - another room - day
13</strong>: , . The post-encephalitics filing past still figures in
African � , ceremonial costumes and masks.</p>
<p><strong>nun o.s. ‘“’</strong>: William?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello o.s.</strong>: Dr. Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>136a. int. another room - natural history museum - day
136</strong>: A working display of a tide pool. Anthony’s reflection
joins Sayer’s in the glass.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’ve always loved tide pools, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: You chose this place? Why?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: ,</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>136a.cont. .</strong>: Sayer glances away, sees Miss Costello
coming. She looks a little irritated. As she arrives - He says it like,
Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: They are.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I ’ d thought about the opera house. Do you
think they’d prefer that?</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: The opera house?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: The Botanical Gardens?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: y5?. Well, where else is there?</p>
<p><strong>137. int. roseland - late afternoon</strong>: Roseland’s Big
Band belting out “That Old Black Magic.” On the dancefloor, the
post-encephalitics dance with one another amidst “normal” middle-aged
and older couples, all having a great time. At the bar, Sayer tries to
get the attention of a young bartender busy mixing drinks. Watching, it
slowly dawns on Rose that something is “wrong” here. More to herself
-</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s legal again?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: For some time now.</p>
<p><strong>- rose</strong>: A Rob Roy on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>137.cont. .</strong>: The young bartender has to think a
moment. Rose turns back to watch the action on the dance floor.
Gesturing to Rose, Miss Costello whispers to the bartender -</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: A Shirley Temple.</p>
<p><strong>138. int. lobby, bainbridge - late afternoon</strong>:
Leonard and Paula crossing toward the front doors. She’s just chatting
but he’s taking it seriously.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Things happen, people are late.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: They won’t be angry.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Oh, they’ll be angry. What’re they going to
do, fire me?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Thanks for talking to me. �</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>138.cont. 138</strong>: She glances back at him. She’s not
sure what he means.</p>
<p><strong>� leonard</strong>: Your father. He knows you visit him.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>� 139. int. roseland - later - evening 139.</strong>: The
band in the middle of “You Hade Me Love You.” At the bar -</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Is he betrothed, do you know?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Not that I know of. I kind of doubt
it.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You made me love you I didn’t want to do it �
I didn’t want to do it . . .</p>
<p><strong>141. int.- corridor &amp; leonard’s ward 14</strong>:
Returning from their night out, happy and satisfied, the post-
encephalitics come down a quiet corridor, trailed by their chaperons.
Passing the examination room, Sayer hears faint typing, and slows.</p>
<p><strong>142. int. examination room - moments later - night
14</strong>: Sayer steps into the room to find a figure hunched over his
typewriter in a pool of lamplight. Glancing over to the door, the figure
is revealed to be Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>leonard “</strong>: Everybody have a good time?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sayer v.o.</strong>: “One - typewriters and writing supplies
in all dayrooms at all times . . .</p>
<p><strong>143. int. board room - day</strong>: Drifting slowly across
the faces of Kaufman, the director and the other board members as Sayer
reads to them from a typewritten sheet of paper –</p>
<p><strong>sayer ;</strong>: ” . . . Two - music and dance classes for
those patients who desire them. Three - technical courses for those who
wish to learn a trade. Four - patients’ grievance committees. Five - the
same food in the patients’ cafeteria as in the staff’s. Six . . . ” and
I happen to think this is an excellent idea, “the establishment of a
permanent hospital library. And”Seven - televisions that work.”</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: “Respectfully, Leonard Lowe.”</p>
<p><strong>144. int. basement - bainbridge - day 144.</strong>: Rumbling
furnaces. The boiler room. Exposed conduit and pipes and ducts on the
ceiling like tangled roots of an enormous metal tree.</p>
<p><strong>144.cont. i</strong>: A subterranean corridor. Deserted
except for Sayer and Leonard above them.</p>
<p><strong>145. int. basement operating theatre - day 1</strong>: A
dusty anatomical skeleton shrouded in fdarkness is suddenly illuminated
as Sayer yanks down a sheet covering a high window. Yanking down
another, a second shaft of light falls on old discarded surgical tables
and equipment. Brain surgeries were once routinely performed here back
in a time when they held out hope for docile patients and dociled the
rest. Used only for storage now, its floor and tiers of observation
benches! are covered with boxes and files and broken furniture. Leonard
stares in at the eerie room and listens to the distant</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It’s your library.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: It’ll take some fixing up � obviously. A
thorough cleaning to begin with. Some desks. Books � of course.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: They agreed to find the money for it. And to
my suggestion that you oversee it and select the books.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>146. int. leonard’s dayroom - day 14</strong>: Fingers on the
keys of a piano, Sayer’s baby grand, moved here</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s still hasn’t talked?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: We think he got sick before he
learned how to talk.</p>
<p><strong>146.cont. 146.</strong>: Listening to the music a moment
more, she corrects herself:</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: To talk with words.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: She’s the daughter of the nephew of a Dutch
archduke. She’s royalty.</p>
<p><strong>beth �</strong>: He’s dead, this duke?</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: He’s been dead a hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Then forget it, I’m not curtsying.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Can I have your hand?</p>
<p>**lucy **: Yes, you can have my hand. Take me away from this place.
.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I’m your doctor, Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You’re my Prince Charming.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Another tough break for me.</p>
<p><strong>margaret o.s.</strong>: I don’t know how to say this, Miriam,
so I ’ m just going to say it.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Your husband? He was granted a divorce
from you in 1953. ,</p>
<p><strong>miriam</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: Francis?</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: Your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>daughter</strong>: Hi, mom.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Of course . . . ’</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: How’s it going, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s it “going?”</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do I feel? My parents are dead. My wife
is I in an institution. My son has disappeared … “Out West” somewhere. I
feel old and I feel swindled, that’s how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>, bert</strong>: He is old.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Pontiac Firebird, 350 engine, now there’s a
car, Bert.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Firebird . . .</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Hi, Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>146a. int. operating theatre / library - later - day 14
6a.</strong>: The anatomical skeleton being dragged across the flpor
like the lifeless thing that it is.</p>
<p><strong>mover 1</strong>: Excuse me, ma’am. .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: . . . bookcases there . . . there . . .
take some of these benches out . . . maybe have a ramp over here . .
.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m going to get rid of this thing.</p>
<p><strong>mover 2</strong>: Excuse me, ma’am</p>
<p><strong>148. int. examination room - day 148.</strong>: Mrs. Lowe,
slowly pacing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He never talked about girls before. He
certainly never had anything to d� with them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: It’s a bit ridiculous all this girl
business, don’t you think? A grown man like him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: You know what he said? I should take a
vacation. I should go away for a few days and “relax.”</p>
<p><strong>148.cont. sayer</strong>: Maybe you should. I’m sure he meant
you deserve a vacation. Which you do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe ^</strong>: I can’t leave him alone in this place.
He’d die without me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: Girls . . .</p>
<p><strong>149. int. sayer’s house - night 149.</strong>: Sayer in bed,
asleep with a book on his chest and his indestructible reading glasses
on his face. The phone rings. He groans and gropes for it, puts the
receiver to his ear.</p>
<p><strong>sayer :</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>leonard’s voice</strong>: I think we should organize a
speaking tour.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>150. int. examination room - same time - night 150.</strong>:
Leonard, wide awake, alone in the room. He’s seated at Sayer’s desk with
Sayer’s office phone to his ear.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I think it’s important. I think it’s
important some things were said.</p>
<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Things that matter. Things that have
happened to me. Things I’ve cone to understand. Things.</p>
<p><strong>151. int. sayer’s house - continued - night 151</strong>:
Sayer is gradually coining to. He glances at his clock. It’s like three
o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Where are you calling from?</p>
<p><strong>leonard’s voice</strong>: Your office. It’s very late,
Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>leonard’s voice</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Stay there. I’m coming over.</p>
<p><strong>leonard’s voice</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>152. int. examination room - later - night 152</strong>:
Dressed haphazardly, hair messed up, eyes still a little unfocussed,
Sayer resembles more a patient than doctor. Clean and alert, Leonard
appears rather more “doctor-like.”</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Read a newspaper, people have forgotten
what life is all about. They’ve forgotten what it is to be alive. They
need to be reminded. They need to be reminded what they have, what they
can lose, what I feel, this, the, the, the . . .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: . . . the joy, the freedom, the
spaciousness of life, the gift of life. This is what they’ve forgotten.
This is what they need to remember. This is what we’ll tell them.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I don’t know if it’s liberation or mania or
love.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: With me?- I never know. �</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What he says is absolutely true. We don’t
really live. Does that mean there’s something wrong with him or us?</p>
<p><strong>sayer &amp; ray</strong>: Us.</p>
<p><strong>156. int. leonard’s dayroom - night 156</strong>: A night
janitor with a cleaning cart peers into the darkened room at Leonard
standing at a window looking out.</p>
<p><strong>janitor .</strong>: Mr. Lowe? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>156.cont. . 156.</strong>: The janitor wheels his cart back
down the corridor. Leonard skyline.</p>
<p><strong>159. int. board room - day , 159.</strong>: Drifting slowly
across the faces of the board members again, and across Sayer -</p>
<p><strong>leonard o.s.</strong>: I ’ m thankful to everyone in this
room . . . I was dead, and you brought me back …</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I ’ m thankful, but what I need now isn’t
here.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Where is it? :</p>
<p><strong>leonard �</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: The simplest thing.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I want to know that I’m free to go for a
walk, if I feel like it. Like any normal person.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I am? Alone?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: What difference does that make?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I think you know.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I don’t know. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It makes all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>leonard -</strong>: You didn’t wake a thing, you woke a
person. I ’ m a person. �</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Mr. Lowe? I wonder . . . are you at
all aware of the unconscious hostility you’re exhibiting towards us
right now?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: How could I be aware of something that’s
unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I ‘m curious . . . I can tell this is
important to you but I’ m not sure why. What would you do if you went
out?</p>
<p><strong>159.cont. leonard 159.</strong>: I don’t know, what would you
do if you were me?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I ’ m hot you. Enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I ’ d walk around. I ’ d talk to people, I
’ d look at things. I’ d decide whether I wanted to go this way, or that
way, or keep going straight. I ’ d do the things you do everyday and
take for granted.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’ll tell you what, we’ll take it under
consideration. We’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>^ 160. int. patients’ cafeteria - day</strong>: Leonard at a
table. Waiting. Sayer appears. Sits.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yeah, I was aware of it. � I was nervous.
It’s nothing. What’d they say?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: They said it’s a dangerous place out there.
They said they can’t be held responsible for what might happen to you
out there. They said no.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: And what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: They don’t have to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Did you agree with them?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I ’ m not sure we’re out of the woods yet,
Leonard. I’m not sure this is nothing. I have to be sure you’re well.
There’ll be time enough -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard …</p>
<p><strong>161. int. corridor - moments later - day</strong>: Leonard
striding down a corridor. Sayer hurrying after him.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: For a walk.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard . . .</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: This is Dr. Sayer . . .</p>
<p><strong>162. int. corridors / lobby - day 162.</strong>: Faces of
patients in wheelchairs blur as Leonard runs past them. In another
corridor faces blur as orderlies rush past them. In another corridor
faces blur as Sayer runs. Leonard reaches the lobby just ahead of the
orderlies. They try to be gentle with him but when he fights to free
himself it it gets out of control. Sayer appears.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Let go of him.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Leonard, stop fighting.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Let ao of him. .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe o.s.</strong>: I don’t understand it, he was never
any trouble before.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He was quiet: and polite and respectful.
He never demanded anything. He was never disobedient.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: He was catatonic, Mrs. Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: I’m speaking of when he was a boy.</p>
<p><strong>163.cont. sayer 163</strong>: fT~ Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He was always nice-minded when he was a
boy. ^</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: I don’t know who that is up there. I
don’t think he knows. You’ve turned Leonard into something he is
not.</p>
<p><strong>164. int. ward 5 stairwell &amp; corridor - day</strong>:
Coming up a flight of stairs, 1930’s music can be heard. ,, Reaching a
caged landing the orderly escorting Sayer unlocks door, leads him along
a short corridor to another door and unlocks that one.</p>
<p><strong>165. int. ward 5 dayroom - continuous - day 165</strong>: An
old black and white musical blaring from a television bolted to the
ceiling. Young male patients, subdued with Thorazine, vacantly staring
at it. &gt; Sayer comes in, finds Leonard in one of the chairs, and
kneels to gain some confidentiality. Leonard cranes slightly to see
around him, to see the television.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: This is a mistake. It’s wrong and it’s cruel
and it should never have happened like this - but you have to understand
- nothing quite like this has happened before, no one knows what to do .
. . Leonard, please don’t ignore me.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I wish you could just walk out like that. I
wish it were that simple.</p>
<p><strong>165.cont. leonard / 165.</strong>: is. .</p>
<p><strong>166. ext. bainbridge hospital - night</strong>: Light glows
in only a few of the windows. In one, on the third floor, the
examination room, a figure in . silhouette , stares out. In another, on
the fifth floor, a second figure in silhouette , behind bars, slowly
paces.</p>
<p><strong>166a. int. ward 5 dayrooh - day 166a.</strong>: The blaring
TV again. Suddenly the picture goes dark. Leonard, who turned it off,
climbs down off a chair and faces the “somnambulant” men who were
“watching.” Moving along their chairs he considers each much as Sayer
considered the post-encephalitic “garden of stone.” Reaching one
stretched out across three chairs, asleep, Leonard</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>169a-. int. elevator &amp; corridor 169a.</strong>: The
elevator door slides open revealing an orderly with several trays of
untouched food on a cart. Kaufman steps in and the door slides shut.
Descending:</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: I guess they’re not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Ward 5.</p>
<p><strong>171. int. ward 5 dayroom - day 171</strong>: Leonard paces
before the entire Ward 5 population, gathered like the blind and the
sick under a revivalist’s tent.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It isn’t us that’s defective, it’s them.
We’re not in crisis, they are. We’ve been through the worst that can
happen to a person and survived it. They haven’t. They fear it. And they
hide from their fear by hiding us, because they know, they know . .
.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: How long have you been here? You don’t
know? A month, a year? .</p>

<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: Oh, is that it -</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: We wake him up, then lock him up, � that’s
not “paranoia,” that’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>kaufman</strong>: I’ve got 20 psychotics up there, “doctor,”

in his room, perched on his bed, Sayer pathetically cleans his remaining

<p><strong>178a. int. ward 5 - later - night 178a.</strong>: The shards
of the lenses layed out on a table. Leonard picks one up, and, turning
it over to consider it, sees that it has already cut his finger. He
doesn’t set it down.</p>
<p><strong>178b. int. stairwell - dawn , 178b.</strong>: A metallic dang
interrupts the music and echoes into silence. Footsteps. Sayer appears,
and slowly climbs up through the caged stairwell. He reaches a landing’
and unlocks a door.</p>

steps into room and quietly crosses it. He peers in at sleeping figures,

750 MGS. In front of it, Leonard seated in a chair, his hands performing
repertoires of tics. He seems wholly unbothered by them.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: . . . some are new . . . some are
elaborations . . . some are counter- tics. They don’t bother me. What

I feel nothing. Like I’m nothing. Like I ’ m dead.</p>

sliding up from 500 to 625 mgs.</p>
<p><strong>192. int. operating theatre - night</strong>: Though the junk
has been cleared and some of the railings ripped out, the place is still
grim, unpainted. Wood scraps and workmen’s tools lay around. There’s a

<p><strong>195. int. leonard’s ward - day 195.</strong>: Leonard buttons
his shirt, then picks up the bow tie he always wears when he’s seeing

<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No, I can do it.</p>

<p><strong>196. int. leonard’s dayroom - later - day 196.</strong>: The
trembling has escalated into a full-blown crisis. The staff and other
patients can’t ignore this one. Sayer wedges past them and into the
room, and crosses quickly to Leonard and his mother, both hysterical.
All trying to speak at once:</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>196.cont. leonard 196.</strong>: . . . I’m ungrateful . . .

<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: When my son was born healthy, I never
asked why. Why was I sp lucky, what did I do to deserve this perfect
child, this perfect life? -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: But when he got sick, you can bet I asked
why. I demanded to know why. Why was this happening?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: There was nothing I could do about it.
There was no one I could go to and say, “Stop this, please stop this,
can’t you see my son is in pain?”</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: He’s fighting, Mrs -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowe</strong>: He’s losing.</p>
<p><strong>196c.cont. 196c.</strong>: Sayer almost recoils, as if from a

alone at a table with a book. He glances up as Sayer sits opposite him,
then down again at the book.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I can’t read anymore. The words are written
too slow. I keep going back to the beginning, to the beginning, and
trying . . .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’ve let the others down.</p>

<p><strong>leonard</strong>: This . . . isn’t . . . me.</p>
<p><strong>198. int. bathroom - morning 198.</strong>: Standing before a
mirror above a sink, Leonard struggles to part his hair straight. He’s
wearing his best clothes, those he wears when he’s seeing Paula, but
they seem to drape awkwardly.</p>
<p><strong>199. int. patients’ cafeteria - day 199.</strong>: He may not
have looked like a patient when Paula first met him, but he does now.
It’s all she can do to not break down in front of him. &gt;</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: .. I worked . . . I had friends about it . .
.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I know, I should do something with my life.

never done any of those things.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: They’ll never let me out of this place.
They shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m not well. I feel well inside when I see
you. I wish you could see what’s inside. Instead of this.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I can see it.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Goodbye. �</p>
<p><strong>199. cont. . 199.</strong>: Some patients glance up from
their food. Ser vers glance up dancing without music . They watch as Leo
n ard ’s tics gradually disappear. They watc h as he finds a sens e of
grace and ease, as he borrows her gra ce and ease. They w a tch him
become, simply, a man dancing with a woman . From somewhere, perhaps
imagined, there is music, a quiet melody played on a piano.</p>
<p><strong>200. int. dayroom - same day 200</strong>: Rolando’s hands on
the keys of the piano, playing the melody.</p>

room. He’s bent, his arms at strange angles like the limbs of a diseased
tree, his legs managing each step only with great concentration. He
nears the center of the room, the area of inconsistent tiles which Sayer
and Miss Costello long ago conformed with shoe polish. Some of the black
has worn off, and as Leonard reaches i t, h e f in ds hi ms elf t hro wn
b y t he ir re gu lar it y. He t rie s to step over to “the other
side,11 but his feet or legs or mind will not do it. Everyone in the
room except Rolando becomes acutely aware of the problem, of the
struggle, of Leonard fighting with all his will, and nothing but it,
to”cross over.” H e-cro sses the “barr ier.” And, wit h sur er bu t sti

before disappearing around a corner. Rolando’s musdc CONTINUES OVER:</p>

<p><strong>sayer’s voice</strong>: When did you realize it wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: When I spoke and you understood me.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: You told him I was a kind man … It’s kind to
give life only to take it away?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: It’s given and taken away from all of
us.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Why doesn’t that comfort me?</p>
<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: Because you are kind. And because
he’s your friend.</p>
<p><strong>202. int. dayroom - night 20</strong>: Through a window,
autumn leaves on trees. And the school yard beyond the field, quiet,
deserted. Pulling back, panes of glass. Across the walls of the dayroom.
Drawings and water colors, of people and: places. To the arm of the
metronome slapping back and forth. And a twisted hand, a pen grasped
awkwardly in it, writing excruciatingly slowly, and just barely
legibly:</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Am I speaking?</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Your mother is well. She’s home. She
visits you on Sundays.</p>
<p><strong>leonard :</strong>: f ~^ She’s living her own life.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s. ,</strong>: She’s trying to.</p>

<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m stronger?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: ,x I’m here, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Do you think you can walk?</p>
<p><strong>203. int. corridor - day 203</strong>: A doctor in a lab
coat, one Sayer long ago imparted his “will of the ball” theory to,
emerges from a ward.</p>
<p><strong>fernando o.s.</strong>: Dr. Tyler?</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>dr. tyler</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: You know that woman in Ward 7 . . . Grace,
uh … what’s her last name … Grace …</p>
<p><strong>dr. tyler</strong>: Does it matter, Fernando?</p>
<p><strong>fernando</strong>: . . . no . . . I guess not . . .</p>

<p><strong>margaret o.s.</strong>: Dr. Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sullivan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>204 cont.</strong>: Sayer and Leonard approach. Margaret has
positioned herself, like Anthony, against the wall, and, pointing out
something on a clipboard to Dr. Sullivan, glances up briefly as Sayer
and</p>
<p><strong>205. int. corridor / lobby - day 205.</strong>: Sayer and
Leonard approaching the lobby. As they enter, the switchboard operator
glances up, notices them, and glances back down without a word. They
approach the front doors. They are almost there. From behind them,
loudly –</p>
<p><strong>miss costello o.s.</strong>: Dr. Kaufman?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman o.s.</strong>: Dr. Sayer?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kaufman ,</strong>: Put a coat on him for Christ’s sake.
�</p>
<p><strong>206. int. dayroom - same time - day 206.</strong>: Though
Rolando is not playing, cannot play, the piano, he can hear it, distant,
like an echo, as a nurse wheels him toward the windows. Other nurses and
orderlies are wheeling Rose, Frank, Bert, and Lucy and the others there.
Sidney is wheeling Lolly. They all “peer” out. They all “see” down
below, standing across the street, Sayer and Leonard.</p>
<p><strong>208. int. dayroom - same time - day 208</strong>: The others
“watch” Sayer cross back to the hospital. They “watch” Leonard staring
after him. He glances down the street, Leonard, glances down the street
the other way. He seems uncertain which way to go . . . He walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>209. int. subway - evening 209</strong>: Rhythmic pounding.
Metal wheels over metal tracks. Leonard feels things.inside his coat
pockets. He,pulls from one several capsules of L-Dopa in a clear plastic
bag; and from the other, a wad of money wrapped in paper on which is
typed his name and “Bainbridge Hospital, Bronx.” He stuffs it all back
into his pocket and glances up. : The train is crowded. Everyone seems
to be hiding behind a newspaper or the veil of a glazed look; everyone
but Leonard and the eleven year old boy seated next to him with his
mother. They’re taking everything in, Leonard and1 the boy - the rumbl
of the train, the overhead lights flashing off and on again, the
mounting excitement they both feel. The boy glances up at Leonard, and,
like a secret -</p>
<p><strong>boy on train</strong>: We’re going to the city.</p>
<p><strong>leonard .</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>210. int. subway station - n.y. - night 210</strong>:
Underground tunnels. People climbing stairs. Leonard climbing with them.
Under exposed pipes and ducts. Along passageways. Through an exit
turnstile. Up more stairs. And finally -</p>
<p><strong>211. ext. new york city - night 2 1..</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>211a. int. examination room - same time - night
211a.</strong>: An oppressive silence. The oppressive institutional
room. Sayer, alone in it, at his desk in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>miss costello o.s.</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: Eleanor.</p>
<p><strong>211b. ext. parking lot, bainbridge - moments later - night

Winded, he reaches her.</p>

<p><strong>miss costello</strong>: I ’d be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>212. ext. new york city - night . 212.</strong>: A mechanical
dog crosses Leonard’s path wagging its tail. Unlike everyone else, he
stops to admire it. He’s enchanted by it. He smiles at the peddler and
the “litter of pups” moving around his feet.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: , They’re so life-like.</p>
<p><strong>212.cont. peddler 212.</strong>: And only five bucks, can you
believe it?</p>
<p><strong>213. int/ext. taxi/streets - night 213.</strong>: In the back
of a taxi, Leonard stares out the window, mesmerized by all he sees. The

<p><strong>hector</strong>: How ’bout those Jets?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I like them.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Broadway Joe.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yeah.</p>

The meter clicks over and into double digits. The taxi is parked across
the street from a diner.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t mind sitting here if you don’t, but
to what end are we sitting here?</p>
<p><strong>219. ext. rockefeller center - night</strong>: Prometheus
stealing fire from heaven, dwarfed by the Christmas tree that towers
over him. Figures glide past the statue. Skaters on the ice rink. It’s
magical.- At least� as-seen, through .Leonard’s eyes. From the promenade
he watches the skaters gliding gracefully over the ice. Hector appears
at his side.</p>
<p><strong>hector :</strong>: I ’ m sorry to bother you, Len, I just
thought you should know this is adding up, you know?</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I didn’t mean that, just -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I don’t need it, you keep it.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Unforgettable.</p>
<p><strong>220. int. taxi - night 220.</strong>: The cab rattling down
another street.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You have children, Hector?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: He’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I thank God for him every day. Every single
day.</p>
<p><strong>221. ext. new york city - night 221.</strong>: The cab,
empty, parked in front of an apartment building in a working class
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>222. int. hector’s apartment - night 222</strong>: The
mechanical dog on a bathroom sink. Leonard staring at his reflection in
a mirror. And at his hands. It’s happening. He’s falling apart. HALLWAY.
Leonard at a bedroom door. Peering in at Hector’s sleeping son. He steps
quietly into the room and places the mechanical dog on the pillow beside
the boy’s head. THE LIVING ROOM. A small Christmas tree. Hector and his
wife sitting on cheap furniture with cups of egg nog. Leonard emerges
from the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I have to be leaving. I want to th-ank you.
You’ve been very kind to me.</p>
<p><strong>222.cont. . . 222.</strong>: Hector and his wife are both
thinking the same thing: this man’s not well and they shouldn’t let him
go.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Leave? You’re our guest, we got dinner
coming. We’re having something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Stay with us.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: Hey -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It has no value to me, believe ; me.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It’s for your son. It’s for him.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: At least let me give you a lift wherever
you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No, I think I ’ d like to walk. . Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: What’s wrong with you, Len?</p>
<p><strong>222.cont. leonard 222</strong>: This is good, what you’ve got
here.</p>
<p><strong>hector</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>223. ext. new york city - night 223.</strong>: Descending
from a fire escape strung with a single strand of Christmas lights . . .
down to the street below, to Leonard, moving along the sidewalk,
noticing: A young couple, bundled up, hurrying down the stairs of a
basement apartment, fumbling with keys; A Christmas tree too large for
the doorway of an another apartment across the street, being tugged at
by someone inside, unseen. &gt; Leonard smiles. His gait and tics, and
especially the smile, make him look insane. He passes a shop window with
very simple ornamentation as the proprietor inside switches out the
lights, and continues on, and into the darkness of the street ahead.</p>
<p><strong>224. ext. east river - night - 224.</strong>: Black water.
The river. The drone of engines and syncopated rhythms of wheels of
unseen cars. Leonard, at the river’s edge, stares into the water. His
hand comes out of his pocket holding the bag of L-Dopa capsules, and he
lets it fall in. It floats for a moment before a force from below, like
a hand, pulls it under.</p>
<p><strong>224a. ext. east river - dawn 224a.</strong>: Leonard on a
bench. Behind him, across an empty field, bums huddled over a barrel
fire warming their hands.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>224a.cont. sayer 224a.</strong>: I’ m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Isn’t that something . . .</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Can you take me home?</p>
<p><strong>leonard v.o.</strong>: When I was a boy I felt myself being
carried away by illness like a swimmer sucked out by the tide.</p>
<p><strong>leonard v.o.</strong>: I feel it again, only this time I’ve
been somewhere. I vent to a</p>
<p><strong>j</strong>: place and felt things I never dreamed of. I went
to a place and felt hope and fear and hatred and love, I glimpsed life .
. .</p>
<p><strong>225. int. leonard’s library - bainbridge - day 225.</strong>:
Drifting slowly across the faces of patients reading in Leonard’s
library, and settling finally tight on him, “asleep.”</p>
<p><strong>leonard v.o.</strong>: It’s good, life.</p>
<p><strong>[– sayer o.s.</strong>: ;</p>
<p><strong>225.cont. 225</strong>: She pulls one of the books down at
random and crosses the , library with Sayer, passing patients -
including the woman with multiple sclerosis - readiny at tables with
flowers on them.</p>
<p><strong>sayer o.s.</strong>: Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>sayer</strong>: I ’ m sorry to wake you, but there’s someone
here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: “Night is generally my time for walking. In
the summer, I often leave home early in the morning and roam about
fields and lanes.: days or weeks together . . .</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: “But saving in the country, I seldom go out
until after dark, though Heaven be thanked, I love its light and feel
the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth as much as any creature living
. . .”</p>
