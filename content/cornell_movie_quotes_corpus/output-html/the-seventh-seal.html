<h1 id="the-seventh-seal">the-seventh-seal</h1>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I am Death.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Have you come for me?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I have been walking by your side for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: That I know.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Are you prepared?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: My body is frightened, but I am not.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Well, there is no shame in that.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Wait a moment.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: That’s what they all say. I grant no
reprieves.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You play chess, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have seen it in paintings and heard it
sung in ballads.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Yes, in fact I’m quite a good chess
player.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: But you can’t be better than I am.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Why do you want to play chess with me?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: That is your privilege.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: The condition is that I may live as long as
I hold out against you. If I win, you will release me. Is it agreed?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You drew black!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Very appropriate. Don’t you think so?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Between a strumpet’s legs to lie Is the life
for which I sigh.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Up above is God Almighty So very far away, But
your brother the Devil You will meet on every level.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: In F�rjestad everyone was talking about evil
omens and other horrible things. Two horses had eaten each other in the
night, and, in the churchyard, graves had been opened and the remains of
corpses scattered all over the place. Yesterday afternoon there were as
many as four suns in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Well, did he show you the way?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Was he a mute?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: No, sir, I wouldn’t say that. As a matter of
fact, he was quite eloquent.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: He was eloquent, all right. The trouble is
that what he had to say was most depressing. One moment you’re bright
and lively, The next you’re crawling with worms. Fate is a terrible
villain And you, my friend, its poor victim.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Must you sing?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Good morning. Have you had breakfast? I can’t
eat grass, worse luck. Can’t you teach me how? We’re a little hard up.
People aren’t very interested in juggling in this part of the
country.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Mia, wake up. Wake up! Mia, I’ve just seen
something. I’ve got to tell you about it!</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What is it? What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Listen, I’ve had a vision. No, it wasn’t a
vision. It was real, absolutely real.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Oh, so you’ve had a vision again!</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: But I did see her!</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Whom did you see?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: The Virgin Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Did you really see her?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: She was so close to me that I could have
touched her. She had a golden crown on her head and wore a blue gown
with flowers of gold. She was barefoot and had small brown hands with
which she was holding the Child and teaching Him to walk. And then she
saw me watching her and she smiled at me. My eyes filled with tears and
when I wiped them away, she had disappeared. And everything became so
still in the sky and on the earth. Can you understand …</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What an imagination you have.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: You don’t believe me! But it was real, I tell
you, not the kind of reality you see every day, but a different
kind.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Perhaps it was the kind of reality you told us
about when you saw the Devil painting our wagon wheels red, using his
tail as a brush.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Why must you keep bringing that up?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: And then you discovered that you had red paint
under your nails.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Well, perhaps that time I made it up. I did it
just so that you would believe in my other visions. The real ones. The
ones that I didn’t make up.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You have to keep your visions under control.
Otherwise people will think that you’re a half-wit, which you’re not. At
least not yet – as far as I know. But, come to think of it, I’m not so
sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I didn’t ask to have visions. I can’t help it
if voices speak to me, if the Holy Virgin appears before me and angels
and devils like my company.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Haven’t I told you once and for all that I
need my morning’s sleep! I have asked you politely, pleaded with you,
but nothing works. So now I’m telling you to shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: If we would only get some rain. Everything is
burned to cinders. We won’t have anything to eat this winter.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: We’ll get by.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I want Mikael to have a better life than
ours.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Mikael will grow up to be a great acrobat – or
a juggler who can do the one impossible trick.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: To make one of the balls stand absolutely still
in the air.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: But that’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Impossible for us – but not for him.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You’re dreaming again.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I’ve composed a song. I made it up during the
night when I couldn’t sleep. Do you want to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Sing it. I’m very curious.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I have to sit up first.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: On a lily branch a dove is perched Against the
summer sky, She sings a wondrous song of Christ And there’s great joy on
high.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Mia! Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: It’s a lovely song.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I haven’t finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I heard it, but I think I’ll sleep a little
longer. You can sing the rest to me afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: All you do is sleep.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Is this supposed to be a mask for an actor? If
the priests didn’t pay us so well, I’d say no thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Are you going to play Death?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Just think, scaring decent folk out of their
wits with this kind of nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: When are we supposed to do this play?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: At the saints’ feast in Elsinore. We’re going
to perform right on the church steps, believe it or not.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better to play something bawdy?
People like it better, and, besides, it’s more fun.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Idiot. There’s a rumor going around that
there’s a terrible pestilence in the land, and now the priests are
prophesying sudden death and all sorts of spiritual agonies.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: And what part am I to play?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: You’re such a damn fool, so you’re going to be
the Soul of Man.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: That’s a bad part, of course.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Who makes the decisions around here? Who is
the director of this company anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Bear this in mind, you fool. Your life hangs
by a thread. Your time is short. Are the women going to like me in this
getup? Will I make a hit? No! I feel as if I were dead already.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Jof!</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Sit still. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I’m as silent as a grave.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Shh! I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: What is this supposed to represent?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: The Dance of Death.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: And that one is Death?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Yes, he dances off with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Why do you paint such nonsense?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: I thought it would serve to remind people
that they must die.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Well, it’s not going to make them feel any
happier.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Why should one always make people happy? It
might not be a bad idea to scare them a little once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Then they’ll close their eyes and refuse to
look at your painting.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Oh, they’ll look. A skull is almost more
interesting than a naked woman.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: If you do scare them …</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: They’ll think.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: And if they think …</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: They’ll become still more scared.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: And then they’ll run right into the arms of
the priests.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: That’s not my business.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You’re only painting your Dance of Death.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: I’m only painting things as they are.
Everyone else can do as he likes.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Just think how some people will curse you.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Maybe. But then I’ll paint something
amusing for them to look at. I have to make a living – at least until
the plague takes me.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: The plague. That sounds horrible.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: You should see the boils on a diseased
man’s throat. You should see how his body shrivels up so that his legs
look like knotted strings – like the man I’ve painted over there.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: That looks terrible.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: It certainly does. He tries to rip out the
boil, he bites his hands, tears his veins open with his fingernails and
his screams can be heard everywhere. Does that scare you?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Scare? Me? You don’t know me. What are the
horrors you’ve painted over there?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: The remarkable thing is that the poor
creatures think the pestilence is the Lord’s punishment. Mobs of people
who call themselves Slaves of Sin are swarming over the country,
flagellating themselves and others, all for the glory of God.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Do they really whip themselves?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Yes, it’s a terrible sight. I crawl into a
ditch and hide when they pass by.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Do you have any brandy? I’ve been drinking
water all day and it’s made me as thirsty as a camel in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: I think I frightened you after all.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I want to talk to you as openly as I can,
but my heart is empty.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: The emptiness is a mirror turned towards my
own face. I see myself in it, and I am filled with fear and disgust.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Through my indifference to my fellow men, I
have isolated myself from their company. Now I live in a world of
phantoms. I am imprisoned in my dreams and fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: And yet you don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I want knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You want guarantees?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Call it whatever you like. Is it so cruelly
inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself
in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: How can we have faith in those who believe
when we can’t have faith in ourselves? What is going to happen to those
of us who want to believe but aren’t able to? And what is to become of
those who neither want to nor are capable of believing?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Why can’t I kill God within me? Why does He
live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse Him and
want to tear Him out of my heart? Why, in spite of everything, is He a
baffling reality that I can’t shake off? Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Yes, I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I want knowledge, not faith, not
suppositions, but knowledge. I want God to stretch out His hand towards
me, reveal Himself and speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: But He remains silent.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I call out to Him in the dark but no one
seems to be there.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Perhaps no one is there.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Then life is an outrageous horror. No one
can live in the face of death, knowing that all is nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Most people never reflect about either death
or the futility of life.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: But one day they will have to stand at that
last moment of life and look towards the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: When that day comes …</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: In our fear, we make an image, and that
image we call God.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You are worrying …</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Death visited me this morning. We are
playing chess together. This reprieve gives me the chance to arrange an
urgent matter.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: What matter is that?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: My life has been a futile pursuit, a
wandering, a great deal of talk without meaning. I feel no bitterness or
self-reproach because the lives of most people are very much like this.
But I will use my reprieve for one meaningful deed.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Is that why you are playing chess with
Death?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: He is a clever opponent, but up to now I
haven’t lost a single man.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: How will you outwit Death in your game?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I use a combination of the bishop and the
knight which he hasn’t yet discovered. In the next move I’ll shatter one
of his flanks.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You’ve tricked and cheated me! But we’ll
meet again, and I’ll find a way.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: We’ll meet at the inn, and there we’ll
continue playing.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: This is my hand. I can move it, feel the
blood pulsing through it. The sun is still high in the sky and I,
Antonius Block, am playing chess with Death.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Me and my master have been abroad and have
just come home. Do you understand, you little pictor?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: The Crusade.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Precisely. For ten years we sat in the Holy
Land and let snakes bite us, flies sting us, wild animals eat us,
heathens butcher us, the wine poison us, the women give us lice, the
lice devour us, the fevers rot us, all for the Glory of God. Our crusade
was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up. But
what you said about the plague was horrible.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: It’s worse than that.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Ah, me. No matter which way you turn, you have
your rump behind you. That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: The rump behind you, the rump behind you
there’s a profound truth.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: This is squire J�ns. He grins at Death, mocks
the Lord, laughs at himself and leers at the girls. His world is a
J�nsworld, believable only to himself, ridiculous to all including
himself, meaningless to Heaven and of no interest to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: That soup of yours has a hell of a stink. What
is it good for?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: She has had carnal intercourse with the
Evil One.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: And now she’s in the stocks.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: She will be burned tomorrow morning at the
parish boundary. But we have to keep the Devil away from the rest of
us.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: And you do that with this stinking mess?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It’s the best remedy: blood mixed with the
bile of a big black dog. The Devil can’t stand the smell.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Neither can I.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Have you seen the Devil?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: You must not talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Can that be so dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: I don’t know, but she is believed to have
caused the pestilence with which we are affected.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: Why do you look so surprised? I steal from
the dead. These days it’s quite a lucrative enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: You’re thinking of running to the village and
telling. That wouldn’t serve any purpose. Each of us has to save his own
skin. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Don’t try to scream. There’s no one around to
hear you, neither God nor man.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I recognize you, although it’s a long time
since we met. Your name is Raval, from the theological college at
Roskilde. You are Dr. Mirabilis, Coelestis et Diabilis.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Am I not right?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You were the one who, ten years ago, convinced
my master of the necessity to join a better- class crusade to the Holy
Land.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You look uncomfortable. Do you have a stomach-
ache?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: When I see you, I suddenly understand the
meaning of these ten years, which previously seemed to me such a waste.
Our life was too good and we were too satisfied with ourselves. The Lord
wanted to punish us for our complacency. That is why He sent you to spew
out your holy venom and poison the knight.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: I acted in good faith.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: But now you know better, don’t you? Because
now you have turned into a thief. A more fitting and rewarding
occupation for scoundrels. Isn’t that so?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: By all means. I’m not bloodthirsty.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: Don’t beat me.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I don’t have the heart to touch you, Doctor.
But remember this: the next time we meet, I’ll brand your face the way
one does with thieves. What I really came for is to get my waterskin
filled.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We have a deep well with cool, fresh water.
Come, I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: J�ns is my name. I am a pleasant and talkative
young man who has never had anything but kind thoughts and has only done
beautiful and noble deeds. I’m kindest of all to young women. With them,
there is no limit to my kindness.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Goodbye, my girl. I could very well have raped
you, but between you and me, I’m tired of that kind of love. It runs a
little dry in the end.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Now that I think of it, I will need a
housekeeper. Can you prepare good food? As far as I know, I’m still a
married man, but I have high hopes that my wife is dead by now. That’s
why I need a housekeeper. The devil with it! Come along and don’t stand
there staring. I’ve saved your life, so you owe me a great deal.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Noble ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for
your interest. Please remain standing for a little longer, or sit on the
ground, because we are now going to perform a tragedia about an
unfaithful wife, her jealous husband, and the handsome lover – that’s
me.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Here is the husband. Here is the wife. If
you’ll shut up over there, you’ll see something splendid. As I said, I
play the lover and I haven’t entered yet. That’s why I’m going to hide
behind the curtain for the time being. It’s damned hot. I think we’ll
have a thunderstorm.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Night and moonlight now prevail Here sleeps my
wife so frail …</p>
<p><strong>voice from the public</strong>: Does she snore?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: May I point out that this is a tragedy, and in
tragedies one doesn’t snore.</p>
<p><strong>voice from the public</strong>: I think she should snore
anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Night and moonlight now prevail. There snores –
I mean sleeps – my wife so frail. Jealous I am, as never before, I hide
myself behind this door. Faithful is she To her lover – not me. He soon
comes a-stealing To awaken her lusty feeling. I shall now kill him dead
For cuckolding me in my bed. There he comes in the moonlight, His white
legs shining bright. Quiet as a mouse, here I’ll lie, Tell him not that
he’s about to die.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Look, there he comes in the night My lover, my
heart’s delight.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: God has sentenced us to punishment. We shall
all perish in the black death. You, standing there like gaping cattle,
you who sit there in your glutted complacency, do you know that this may
be your last hour? Death stands right behind you. I can see how his
crown gleams in the sun. His scythe flashes as he raises it above your
heads. Which one of you shall he strike first? You there, who stand
staring like a goat, will your mouth be twisted into the last unfinished
gasp before nightfall? And you, woman, who bloom with life and self-
satisfaction, will you pale and become extinguished before the morning
dawns? You back there, with your swollen nose and stupid grin, do you
have another year left to dirty the earth with your refuse? Do you know,
you insensible fools, that you shall die today or tomorrow, or the next
day, because all of you have been sentenced? Do you hear what I say? Do
you hear the word? You have been sentenced, sentenced!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Lord have mercy on us in our humiliation!
Don’t turn your face from us in loathing and contempt, but be merciful
to us for the sake of your son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: This damned ranting about doom. Is that food
for the minds of modern people? Do they really expect us to take them
seriously?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Yes, now you grin at me, my lord. But allow me
to point out that I’ve either read, heard or experienced most of the
tales which we people tell each other.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Even the ghost stories about God the Father,
the angels, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost – all these I’ve accepted
without too much emotion.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: My little stomach is my world, my head is my
eternity, and my hands, two wonderful suns. My legs are time’s damned
pendulums, and my dirty feet are two splendid starting points for my
philosophy. Everything is worth precisely as much as a belch, the only
difference being that a belch is more satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: What are you screaming about?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I am Plog, the smith, and you are the squire
J�ns.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: That’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Have you seen my wife?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: No, I haven’t. But if I had seen her and she
looked like you, I’d quickly forget that I’d seen her.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Well, in that case you haven’t seen her.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Maybe she’s run off.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Do you know anything?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I know quite a lot, but not about your wife.
Go to the inn. Maybe they can help you.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: Yes, it’s true! The plague is spreading
along the west coast. People are dying like flies. Usually business
would be good at this time of year, but, damn it, I’ve still got my
whole stock unsold.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They speak of the judgment day. And all these
omens are terrible. Worms, chopped-off hands and other monstrosities
began pouring out of an old woman, and down in the village another woman
gave birth to a calf’s head.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: The day of judgment. Imagine.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: It hasn’t rained here for a month. We’ll
surely lose our crops.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: And people are acting crazy, I’d say. They
flee the country and carry the plague with them wherever they go.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: The day of judgment. Just think, just
think!</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: If it’s as they say, I suppose a person
should look after his house and try to enjoy life as long as he can.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But there have been other things too, such
things that can’t even be spoken of. Things that mustn’t be named – but
the priests say that the woman carries it between her legs and that’s
why she must cleanse herself.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Judgment day. And the Riders of the
Apocalypse stand at the bend in the village road. I imagine they’ll come
on judgment night, at sundown.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: There are many who have purged themselves
with fire and died from it, but the priests say that it’s better to die
pure than to live for hell.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: This is the end, yes, it is. No one says
it out loud, but all of us know that it’s the end. And people are going
mad from fear.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: So you’re afraid too.</p>
<p><strong>merchant</strong>: Of course I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: The judgment day becomes night, and the
angels descend and the graves open. It will be terrible to see.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Do you want this armlet? You can have it
cheap.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: It’s real silver.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: It’s nice. But it’s surely too expensive for
me.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Excuse me, but has anyone here seen my
wife?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Has she disappeared?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: They say she’s run away.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Has she deserted you?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: With an actor.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: An actor! If she’s got such bad taste, then I
think you should let her go.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: You’re right. My first thought, of course, was
to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Oh. But to murder her, that’s a terrible thing
to do.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I’m also going to kill the actor.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: The actor?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Of course, the one she eloped with.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: What has he done to deserve that?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Are you stupid?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: The actor! Now I understand. There are too many
of them, so even if he hasn’t done anything in particular you ought to
kill him merely because he’s an actor.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: You see, my wife has always been interested in
the tricks of the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: And that turned out to be her misfortune.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Her misfortune, but not mine, because a person
who’s born unfortunate can hardly suffer from any further misfortune.
Isn’t that true?</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Listen, you! You sit there and lie to the
smith.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I! A liar!</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: You’re an actor too and it’s probably your
partner who’s run off with Plog’s old lady.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Are you an actor too?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: An actor! Me! I wouldn’t quite call myself
that!</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: We ought to kill you; it’s only logical.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: You’re really funny.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: How strange – you’ve turned pale. Have you
anything on your conscience?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: You’re funny. Don’t you think he’s funny? Oh,
you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Maybe we should mark you up a little with a
knife, like they do petty scoundrels of your kind.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: What have you done with my wife?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Do you want to hurt me? Why? Have I provoked
someone, or got in the way? I’ll leave right now and never come
back.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Get up so everyone can hear you. Talk
louder.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Stand on your head so that we can see how
good an actor you are.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: What have you done with my wife?</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Don’t lie there moaning. Get up and
dance.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I don’t want to. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: Show us how you imitate a bear.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I can’t play a bear.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Let’s see if you can’t after all.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: Up again! Be a good bear.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I haven’t done any harm. I haven’t got the
strength to play a bear any more.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Do you remember what I was going to do to you
if we met again?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I’m a man who keeps his word.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Mikael.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Oh, he’ll soon be two.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: He’s big for his age.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you think so? Yes, I guess he’s rather
big.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You played some kind of show this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Did you think it was bad?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You are more beautiful now without your face
painted, and this gown is more becoming.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You see, Jonas Skat has run off and left us, so
we’re in real trouble now.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Is that your husband?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Jonas! The other man is my husband. His name is
Jof.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Oh, that one.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: And now there’s only him and me. We’ll have to
start doing tricks again and that’s more trouble than it’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Do you do tricks also?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: We certainly do. And Jof is a very skillful
juggler.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Is Mikael going to be an acrobat?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Jof wants him to be.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: But you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I don’t know. Perhaps he’ll become a
knight.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Let me assure you, that’s no pleasure
either.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No, you don’t look so happy.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Are you tired?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have dull company.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you mean your squire?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No, not him.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Who do you mean, then?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Myself.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Do you, really?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Yes, I understand rather well. I have often
wondered why people torture themselves as often as they can. Isn’t that
so?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Ouch, it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Why did you have to go there? And of course you
drank.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Ouch! I didn’t drink anything.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Then I suppose you were boasting about the
angels and devils you consort with. People don’t like someone who has
too many ideas and fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I swear to you that I didn’t say a word about
angels.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You were, of course, busy singing and dancing.
You can never stop being an actor. People also become angry at that, and
you know it.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Look what I bought for you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You couldn’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: But I got it anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Oh, how they beat me.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Why didn’t you beat them back?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I only become frightened and angry. I never get
a chance to hit back. I can get angry, you know that. I roared like a
lion.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Were they frightened?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: No, they just laughed.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you notice how good he smells?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: And he is so compact to hold. You’re a sturdy
one. A real acrobat’s body.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Yes, this is my husband, Jof.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have just told your wife that you have a
splendid son. He’ll bring great joy to you.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Yes, he’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Have we nothing to offer the knight, Mia?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Thank you, I don’t want anything.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I picked a basket of wild strawberries this
afternoon. And we have a drop of milk fresh from a cow …</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: … that we were allowed to milk. So, if you
would like to partake of this humble fare, it would be a great
honor.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Please be seated and I’ll bring the food.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Where are you going next?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Up to the saints’ feast at Elsinore.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I wouldn’t advise you to go there.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Why not, if I may ask?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: The plague has spread in that direction,
following the coast line south. It’s said that people are dying by the
tens of thousands.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Really! Well, sometimes life is a little
hard.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: May I suggest … … that you follow me through
the forest tonight and stay at my home if you like. Or go along the east
coast. You’ll probably be safer there.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I wish you good appetite.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I humbly thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: These are wild strawberries from the forest. I
have never seen such large ones. They grow up there on the hillside.
Notice how they smell!</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Your suggestion is good, but I must think it
over.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: It might be wise to have company going through
the forest. It’s said to be full of trolls and ghosts and bandits.
That’s what I’ve heard.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Yes, I’d say that it’s not a bad idea, but I
have to think about it. Now that Skat has left, I am responsible for the
troupe. After all, I have become director of the whole company.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: After all, I have become director of the whole
company.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you want some strawberries?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: This man saved my life. Sit down, my friend,
and let us be together.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Oh, how nice this is.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: For a short while.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Nearly always. One day is like another. There
is nothing strange about that. The summer, of course, is better than the
winter, because in summer you don’t have to be cold. But spring is best
of all.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I have written a poem about the spring. Perhaps
you’d like to hear it. I’ll run and get my lyre.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Not now, Jof. Our guests may not be amused by
your songs.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: By all means. I write little songs myself. For
example, I know a very funny song about a wanton fish which I doubt that
you’ve heard yet.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You’ll not get to hear it either. There are
persons here who don’t appreciate my art and I don’t want to upset
anyone. I’m a sensitive soul.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: People are troubled by so much.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: It’s always better when one is two. Have you no
one of your own?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Yes, I think I had someone.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: And what is she doing now?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You look so solemn. Was she your beloved?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: We were newly married and we played
together. We laughed a great deal. I wrote songs to her eyes, to her
nose, to her beautiful little ears. We went hunting together and at
night we danced. The house was full of life …</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you want some more strawberries?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Faith is a torment, did you know that? It is
like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears,
no matter how loudly you call.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I don’t understand what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Everything I’ve said seems meaningless and
unreal while I sit here with you and your husband. How unimportant it
all becomes suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Now you don’t look so solemn.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I shall remember this moment. The silence,
the twilight, the bowls of strawberries and milk, your faces in the
evening light. Mikael sleeping, Jof with his lyre. I’ll try to remember
what we have talked about. I’ll carry this memory between my hands as
carefully as if it were a bowl filled to the brim with fresh milk.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: And it will be an adequate sign – it will be
enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I have been waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Pardon me. I was detained for a few moments.
Because I revealed my tactics to you, I’m in retreat. It’s your
move.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Why do you look so satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: That’s my secret.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Of course. Now I take your knight.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Have you tricked me?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Of course. You fell right in the trap.
Check!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Don’t worry about my laughter; save your
king instead.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You’re rather arrogant.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Our game amuses me.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: It’s your move. Hurry up. I’m a little
pressed for time.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I understand that you’ve a lot to do, but
you can’t get out of our game. It takes time.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Are you going to escort the juggler and his
wife through the forest? Those whose names are Jof and Mia and who have
a small son?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Oh, no reason at all.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: God in heaven, isn’t this Plog, the smith?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Are you sitting here sniveling in
loneliness?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Yes, yes, look at the smith. He moans like a
rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: If I were in your boots, I’d be happy to get
rid of a wife in such an easy way.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I! A hundred times and more. I can’t keep
count of all my wives any longer. But it’s often that way when you’re a
traveling man.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I can assure you that one wife is worse than a
hundred, or else I’ve had worse luck than any poor wretch in this
miserable world, which isn’t impossible.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Yes, it’s hell with women and hell without
them. So, however you look at it, it’s still best to kill them off while
it’s most amusing.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Women’s nagging, the shrieking of children and
wet diapers, sharp nails and sharp words, blows and pokes, and the
devil’s aunt for a mother-in-law. And then, when one wants to sleep
after a long day, there’s a new song – tears, whining and moans loud
enough to wake the dead.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Why don’t you kiss me good night?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Why don’t you sing a song for me?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Why don’t you love me the way you did when we
first met?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Why don’t you look at my new slip?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You only turn your back and snore.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Oh hell!</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Oh hell. And now she’s gone. Rejoice!</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I’ll snip their noses with pliers, I’ll bash
in their chests with a small hammer, I’ll tap their heads ever so
lightly with a sledge.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Look how he howls again.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Maybe I love her.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: So, maybe you love her! Then, you poor
misguided ham shank, I’ll tell you that love is another word for lust,
plus lust, plus lust and a damn lot of cheating, falseness, lies and all
kinds of other fooling around.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Yes, but it hurts anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Of course. Love is the blackest of all
plagues, and if one could die of it, there would be some pleasure in
love. But you almost always get over it.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: No, no, not me.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Yes, you too. There are only a couple of poor
wretches who die of love once in a while. Love is as contagious as a
cold in the nose. It eats away at your strength, your independence, your
morale, if you have any. If everything is imperfect in this imperfect
world, love is most perfect in its perfect imperfection.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: You’re happy, you with your oily words, and,
besides, you believe your own drivel.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Believe! Who said that I believed it? But I
love to give good advice. If you ask me for advice you’ll get two pieces
for the price of one, because after all I really am an educated man.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Listen, J�ns. May I go with you through the
forest? I’m so lonely and don’t want to go home because everyone will
laugh at me.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Only if you don’t whimper all the time,
because in that case we’ll all have to avoid you.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: J�ns! Watch out. That one wants to fight all
the time. He’s not quite sane.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Yes, but now he’s just sniveling.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I’m really sorry if I hurt you. But I have
such a hell of a temper, you know. Shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Come in my arms, little brother.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Thank you, thank you, perhaps later. But now
we’re really in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Now the moon has come out of the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: That’s good. Now we can see the road
better.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I don’t like the moon tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: The trees stand so still.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: That’s because there’s no wind.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I guess he means that they stand very
still.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: It’s completely quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: If one could hear a fox at least.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Or an owl.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Or a human voice besides one’s own.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They say it’s dangerous to remain standing in
moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: To the place of execution.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Yes, now I can see. It’s the girl who has done
it with the Black One. The witch?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I see that they have hurt your hands.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I have a potion that will stop your
pain.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Why do you burn her at this time of night?
People have so few diversions these days.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Saints preserve us, be quiet! It’s said
that she brings the Devil with her wherever she goes.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You are eight brave men, then.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Well, we’ve been paid. And this is a
volunteer job.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: My name is Tyan, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: Fourteen, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: And is it true that you have been in league
with the Devil?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: They say that you have been in league with
the Devil.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Not out of curiosity, but for very personal
reasons. I too want to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I want to ask him about God. He, if anyone,
must know.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: You can see him anytime.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: You must do as I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: Look into my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: What do you see? Do you see him?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I see fear in your eyes, an empty, numb
fear. But nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: No one, nothing, no one?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: Can’t you see him behind your back?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No, there is no one there.</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: But he is with me everywhere. I only have to
stretch out my hand and I can feel his hand. He is with me now too. The
fire won’t hurt me. He will protect me from everything evil.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Has he told you this?</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Has he said it?</p>
<p><strong>tyan</strong>: I know it, I know it. You must see him
somewhere, you must. The priests had no difficulty seeing him, nor did
the soldiers. They are so afraid of him that they don’t even dare touch
me.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Why have you crushed her hands?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: We didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Ask the monk.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: What have you done with the child?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Don’t you ever stop asking questions?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No, I’ll never stop.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: For a moment I thought of killing the
soldiers, but it would do no good. She’s nearly dead already.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I’ve told you to be careful. Don’t go too
close to her.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Take this and it will stop the pain.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: What does she see? Can you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: She feels no more pain.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: You don’t answer my question. Who watches over
that child? Is it the angels, or God, or the Devil, or only the
emptiness? Emptiness, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: This cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Look at her eyes, my lord. Her poor brain has
just made a discovery. Emptiness under the moon.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: We stand powerless, our arms hanging at our
sides, because we see what she sees, and our terror and hers are the
same. That poor little child. I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it …</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Oh, now it came over me again!</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Don’t scream. What came over you?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: My wife, damn it. She is so beautiful. She is
so beautiful that she can’t be described without the accompaniment of a
lyre.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Now it starts again.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Her smile is like brandy. Her eyes like
blackberries …</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Get up, you tear-drenched pig. We’ll lose the
others.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Yes, of course, of course. Her nose is like a
little pink potato; her behind is like a juicy pear – yes, the whole
woman is like a strawberry patch. I can see her in front of me, with
arms like wonderful cucumbers.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Saints almighty, stop! You’re a very bad poet,
despite the fact that you’re drunk. And your vegetable garden bores
me.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Look there.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Do you see something?</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: There, over there!</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Hang on to something, my friends. The hour is
near! Who is that at the edge of the forest if not my own dearly
beloved, with actor attached?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: You miserable stubbleheaded bastard of seven
scurvy bitches, if I were in your lousy rags I would be stricken with
such eternal shame about my breath, my voice, my arms and legs – in
short, about my whole body – that I would immediately rid nature of my
own embarrassing self.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Watch out, you perfumed slob, that I don’t
fart on you and immediately blow you down to the actor’s own red-hot
hell, where you can sit and recite monologues to each other until the
dust comes out of the Devil’s ears.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Forgive me, dear little husband, I’ll never do
it again. I am so sorry and you can’t imagine how terribly that man over
there betrayed me.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I’ll kill him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yes, do that, just kill him. He isn’t even a
human being.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Hell, he’s an actor.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He is only a false beard, false teeth, false
smiles, rehearsed lines, and he’s as empty as a jug. Just kill him.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: She’s right. Just kill me. If you thought that
I was going to apologize for being what I am, you are mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Look how sickening he is. How he makes a fool
of himself, how he puts on an act. Dear Plog, kill him.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: My friends, you have only to push, and my
unreality will soon be transformed into a new, solid reality. An
absolutely tangible corpse.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Do something then. Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: He has to fight me, otherwise I can’t kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Your life’s thread now hangs by a very ragged
shred. Idiot, your day is short.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: You’ll have to irritate me a little more to
get me as angry as before.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: I forgive all of you. Pray for me
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: Oh dear, dear, I didn’t mean it that way!
Look, there’s no life left in him. I was beginning to like him, and in
my opinion Lisa was much too spiteful.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: He’s dead, totally, enormously dead. In fact,
I’ve never seen such a dead actor.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Come on, let’s go. This is nothing to mourn
over. He has only himself to blame.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: And I have to be married to her.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: We must go on.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Now that was a good scene. I’m really a good
actor. After all, why shouldn’t I be a little pleased with myself? But
where shall I go? I’ll wait until it becomes light and then I’ll find
the easiest way out of the forest. I’ll climb up a tree for the time
being so that no bears, wolves or ghosts can get at me.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Tomorrow I’ll find Jof and Mia and then we’ll
go to the saints’ feast in Elsinore. We’ll make lots of money there.
Now, I’ll sing a little song to myself: I am a little bird Who sings
whate’er he will, And when I am in danger I fling out a pissing trill As
in the carnal thrill. It’s boring to be alone in the forest tonight. The
terrible night doesn’t frighten me …</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Workmen in the forest. Oh, well! The terrible
night doesn’t frighten me … Hey, what the devil … it’s my tree they’re
cutting down.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Hey, you! Do you hear me, you tricky bastard?
What are you doing with my tree?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Can’t you at least answer me? Politeness costs
so little. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I’m sawing down your tree because your time
is up.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: It won’t do. I haven’t got time.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: So you haven’t got time.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: No, I have my performance.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Then it’s canceled because of death.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: My contract.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Your contract is terminated.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: My children, my family.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Shame on you, Skat!</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Yes, I’m ashamed.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Isn’t there any way to get off? Aren’t there
any special rules for actors?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: No, not in this case.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: No loopholes, no exceptions?</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Perhaps you’ll take a bribe.</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>skat</strong>: Help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Soon dawn will come, but the heat continues to
hang over us like a smothering blanket.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m so frightened.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: We feel that something is going to happen to
us, but we don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Maybe it’s the day of judgment.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: The day of judgment …</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Do you have some water?</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Can’t you give me a little water? I have the
plague.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: Don’t come here. If you do I’ll slit your
throat. Keep to the other side of the tree.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: I’m afraid of death.</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: I don’t want to die! I don’t want to!</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Can’t you have pity on me? Help me! At least
talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: I am going to die. I. I. I! What will happen
to me! Can no one console me? Haven’t you any compassion? Can’t you see
that I …</p>
<p><strong>raval</strong>: Can’t anyone … only a little water.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: It’s no use. It’s no use. I know that it’s no
use. It’s meaningless. It’s totally meaningless. I tell you that it’s
meaningless. Can’t you hear that I’m consoling you?</p>
<p><strong>ravel</strong>: Help me, help me!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Shall we play our game to the end?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Your move!</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Now I take your queen.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I didn’t notice that.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Mia!</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Yes, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I see something terrible. Something I almost
can’t talk about.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: The knight is sitting over there playing
chess.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Yes, I can see that too and I don’t think it’s
so terrible.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: But do you see who he’s playing with?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: He is alone. You mustn’t frighten me this
way.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: No, no, he isn’t alone.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Who is it, then?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Death. He is sitting there playing chess with
Death himself.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You mustn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: We must try to escape.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: One can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: We must try. They are so occupied with their
game that if we move very quietly, they won’t notice us.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I have harnessed the horse. The wagon is
standing near the big tree. You go first and I’ll follow you with the
packs. See that Mikael doesn’t wake up.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: It is your move, Antonius Block.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Have you lost interest in our game?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Lost interest? On the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You seem anxious. Are you hiding
anything?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Nothing escapes you – or does it?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Nothing escapes me. No one escapes from
me.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: It’s true that I’m worried.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: I’ve forgotten how the pieces stood.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: But I have not forgotten. You can’t get away
that easily.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Now I see something interesting.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: You are mated on the next move, Antonius
Block.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: Did you enjoy your reprieve?</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I’m happy to hear that. Now I’ll be leaving
you. When we meet again, you and your companions’ time will be up.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: And you will divulge your secrets.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I have no secrets.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: So you know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>death</strong>: I have nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What a strange light.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I guess it’s the thunderstorm which comes with
dawn.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No, it’s something else. Something terrible. Do
you hear the roar in the forest?</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: It’s probably rain.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No, it isn’t rain. He has seen us and he’s
following us. He has overtaken us; he’s coming towards us.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Not yet, Mia. In any case, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I’m so afraid. I’m so afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: Get into the wagon, Mia. Crawl in quickly.
We’ll lie down, Mia, with Mikael between us.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: It is the Angel of Death that’s passing over
us, Mia. It’s the Angel of Death. The Angel of Death, and he’s very
big.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Do you feel how cold it is? I’m freezing. I’m
terribly cold.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: I heard from people who came from the crusade
that you were on your way home. I’ve been waiting for you here. All the
others have fled from the plague.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: Don’t you recognize me any more?</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: You also have changed.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: Now I can see that it’s you. Somewhere in
your eyes, somewhere in your face, but hidden and frightened, is that
boy who went away so many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: It’s over now and I’m a little tired.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: I see that you’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Over there stand my friends.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: Ask them in. They will break the fast with
us.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: “And when the Lamb broke the seventh seal,
there was silence in heaven for about the space of half an hour. And I
saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given
seven trumpets. And another …”</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: “The first angel sounded, and there followed
hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and
the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was
burnt up.”</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: “And the second angel sounded, and as it were
a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and a third
part of the sea became blood …”</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Was someone there?</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: No, my lord. I saw no one.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: “And the third angel sounded, and there fell
a great star from heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell upon
the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters; and the
name of the star is called Wormwood …”</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: Good morning, noble lord.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: I am Karin, the knight’s wife, and welcome
you courteously to my house.</p>
<p><strong>plog</strong>: I am a smith by profession and rather good at
my trade, if I say so myself. My wife Lisa – curtsy for the great lord,
Lisa. She’s a little difficult to handle once in a while and we had a
little spat, so to speak, but no worse than most people.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: From our darkness, we call out to Thee,
Lord. Have mercy on us because we are small and frightened and
ignorant.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: In the darkness where You are supposed to be,
where all of us probably are…. In the darkness You will find no one to
listen to Your cries or be touched by Your sufferings. Wash Your tears
and mirror Yourself in Your indifference.</p>
<p><strong>knight</strong>: God, You who are somewhere, who must be
somewhere, have mercy upon us.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I could have given you an herb to purge you of
your worries about eternity. Now it seems to be too late. But in any
case, feel the immense triumph of this last minute when you can still
roll your eyes and move your toes.</p>
<p><strong>karin</strong>: Quiet, quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jons</strong>: I shall be silent, but under protest.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It is the end.</p>
<p><strong>jof</strong>: I see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against
the dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The smith and Lisa and the
knight and Raval and J�ns and Skat. And Death, the severe master,
invites them to dance. He tells them to hold each other’s hands and then
they must tread the dance in a long row. And first goes the master with
his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles at the end with his lyre.
They dance away from the dawn and it’s a solemn dance towards the dark
lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the
tears from their cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You with your visions and dreams.</p>
