<p><strong>angel eyes</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Can you hear me? This one’s conscious!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Paramedics on the way!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Wait. Wait. Listen to me. Can you feel
that?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s my hand. Hold it. Go on – as hard as
you can.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s over, and I’ve got you, and you’re
safe. You’re safe now. You got that? Don’t let go. Don’t let me go.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That car is older than they are.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: ’67 Chevy Impala.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Needs a servicing.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t we all.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Get it together, officer.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my coffee again!
You didn’t like his hair, or what?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I love Elvis hair. They were going two damn
miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Let’s roll to this – fight in progress.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Y’know… since we’re both walking the same
way, I could take one of those bags for you. That way, I do some upper
body work while I’m walking along. Helps my back. What d’you say?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Right now your mind’s making pictures of me
robbing your groceires, but, y’know, nine times out of ten, people do
the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It’s the dog food that makes it so
heavy.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I guess it’s worth it… for a good dog.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Look at this bitch. Whoo! Benny, look at
this!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You come in with me. Hey, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: You’re going to arrest me, you come into the
back seat with me. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Come on. We’ll have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Three Adam Five – show us 1019 to the jail
with one male prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Take off your uniform. Take off my handcuffs,
bitch, and come back here. I want one touch.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Give it a rest!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: If you’re going to put me away, you gotta give
me one sweet touch.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That ain’t the touch. That ain’t the touch I
want.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: As I remove your cuffs, I want you to put
your hands here. Spread your legs. More.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: That’s it. Back off, John, we got it.</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just dealt with the situation. The
prisoner…</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: And you don’t see a pattern here? I want
you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. All
right? Are you taking notes?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: You broke his nose.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He grabbed me. End of story.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: And you were waiting for him. You were
hoping. You were making long-range plans for his ass while he was
mouthing off in the car – and you’re supposed to be above that shit.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If you think I crossed the line, put it in
the report.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Pogo, stop the shit. What is it? You pissed
off at me, too?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Not you, Rob. You’re a rare unthreatened
male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where I eat – so
everything’s code four.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Come over for dinner tonight. I’ll call
Charlene. She’d like to see you. It’s been awhile. We’ll talk about
it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Thanks. But she’ll invite friends, try and
fix me up. She’s always trying to fix me up so she doesn’t have to worry
about you and me.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: She doesn’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: They all worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You don’t need to fix me, Robby, or fix me
up. I don’t want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away ’cause
he can’t stand the cop thing – or worse: he wants cop stories every
night ’cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my
head. Anyway, I’m busy tonight.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Got some action, huh? Well, that’s
promising.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yeah. Hot and heavy.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Hey! You want to turn that volume down?
What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What’s the point of blasting your music
through the whole zip code? Don’t you realize there are kids trying to
sleep in these apartments – old people, sick people?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You better watch your mouth, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why? What’re you gonna do? Kill me?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Guy’s nuts. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Hi. Your keys are in the…</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Oh, thank you. Thanks a lot. God. I was
trying to carry Tommy and all these bags. He was so tired. Of course, as
soon as I put him down he had all this energy…</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Y’know, we were just baking nectarine bars
because the peaches weren’t ripe. Ever had a nectarine bar?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Sorry. Gotta be going.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Sherry!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Vander. You’re looking good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Oh, you just wait. I splurged.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: It’s for the church and the party. It’s
just a little too long.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Looks great.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Y’know, I cried over the invitation –
just imagine me in church. It’ll be so good to spend time with you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: You know Dan and I renewed our vows
last year. I bet that’s where your mom got the idea.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Their vows?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Your mom and dad – the ceremony…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Oh, well… y’know, I just got that
invitation a few… just now, so I’m sure you’ll…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, yeah. We’ve had… there’s been some
problems with the mail in our building, so… I’ll probably get it
today.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So, I guess I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Sure, honey. I’ll see you there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I didn’t see his truck, so…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Kathy and the boy? Bet he’s big now.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Growin’ fast.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Is he looking more like you now – or did he
get lucky?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: He’s got Kathy’s looks and brains and my
strong back. You should feel his grip. You just passing by?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Place is coming along nice. The octagon
window. Dad’s signature.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Look, Larry, I shouldn’t have to hear it
from Mrs. Vander – about what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So you really weren’t going to tell me?
Nobody was going to tell me? Mom and Dad renewing their vows, the
church, the party. Mrs. Vander is all excited. She bought a new dress.
It’s blue.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We’re workin’ on Dad. We think you should be
there. We told him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mom told him?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: We mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He’s holding out, hah?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You want to come?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s my family. Jesus, Lar. It’s over ten
years, and he won’t let go of it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You two were always head to head.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: For good reason. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let’s just leave it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re still scared of him.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t think it’s a good idea you coming
around here in uniform. People see it, they think we’re in trouble
here.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Nice seeing you, too.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Two more minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Hi! Look – it’s your Auntie Sharon.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.</p>
<p><strong>larry jr.</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Ow! You hurt my hand with that grip.
Whew.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: We’re bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it’s
good to see you. It’s been awhile. What?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh, I went boom into a low shelf – chasing
after him of course. How’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m semi-okay. I heard about the… ceremony
and the party.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Oh. I hope you’ll be there. Really.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Take it easy. You too, Champ.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, no. You’re not breaking my fingers
again.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Break-in alarm. One suspect in – nobody out.
Take the back.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect fleeing
south on Pico Place, young man, green jacket. No visible weapon…
Robby!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Right behind you! Stop and lie down with your
arms… shit.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Careful!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I see him!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Citizen on your right! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Gun!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Freeze! Right there!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Hey! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You got him?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: He was armed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Citizen took him down.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No shit!?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I… just saw it and… I saw the gun, so…</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: You all right, Pogo?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I was dead. Y’know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He had me. I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I was just walking by. I live near here.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Sergeant’s going to want to talk to you,
Mr. Lambert. We’ll need a statement.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t worry about it. That’s just procedure.
Look – we appreciate what you did. No bullshit. Let us buy you a drink
tonight, all right? You know where the Rib House is?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I got you nectarines because the peaches are
hard as rocks.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Your jacket’s all dirty.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I tackled a guy.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Why would you ‘tackle’ a guy?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why do you think?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: He had the ball. He was going for a
touchdown.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Can you be serious?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What day is today?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Met somebody today.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Oh? That’s good. Ahh – they had the
broccolini today. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: A woman.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: You didn’t tackle her, too, did you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Good, Catch.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She’s a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Are you in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. No trouble.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Well… that’s a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I saw her once a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She looks the same.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Yeah. My wife’s got him in agility
class.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: ‘Rex.’ Rex is good. I wonder who the first
person was to name a dog ‘Fido,’ and what the hell does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I like how you’re always asking the big
questions, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got a big question for you, Pogo – but I can
only ask it when we’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Here – use this – call your wife and ask her
instead.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: I happen to know Ray’s wife is busy
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why doesn’t your partner ever come out with
us?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Robby’s a family man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m a family man.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yeah, but his family actually likes him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That Lambert – I guess he’s not showing
either.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: The head. Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: She’s just gonna freshen up her makeup.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re wearing makeup?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That reminds me, Ray. You still have that
eye-liner you borrowed from me?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We thought you wouldn’t show. Why you
sitting here?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t talk to a lot of people. Would
you…?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I didn’t have a chance to thank you. I’m
Sharon Pogue.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You look familiar.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I guess I live on the beat you patrol.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why would you do that – jump a man with a
gun?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: He was going to shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He could’ve shot you. You have a death wish?
You a bungee jumper?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. I didn’t have time to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What d’you think about it now?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I figure… it was worth the risk.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: For someone you don’t even know?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah – and for what you do. I think cops are
great. Out there, trying to keep it safe. You know? Tough job. Firemen
are everybody’s heroes. Kids wave at firemen. People should wave at
cops. Did you ever think about how many people are walking around this
town because you saved them?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I never thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: … because you helped them or because you
arrested somebody who would’ve hurt them or because you just… did your
job?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Now I’m walking around this town because of
you. Ever think about that? Maybe you should be a cop.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t know… I look pretty dumb in a
hat…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: … and I don’t drive and, like I said, I don’t
talk to many people. Am I talking too much? I am. You go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay. What d’you do? You employed around
here? Oh, God. Sorry. Every time I try to talk to somebody, it comes out
like an interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Where do you want to be ten years from
now?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Somebody taught that to me. Kind of a
shortcut. You ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow – what’re
your dreams for ten years from now. It’s supposed to get things
started.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Does it work?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I never tried it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. Really. I just remembered it – God is my
witness.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Not in here. It’s mostly cops.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You have a nice smile.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So… what were we talking about? Oh, yeah,
you were giving me some line about starting a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: The shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay. I’ll play.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Tomorrow I’ve got a night watch shift. If
the weather clears, in the morning I’ll go hiking. If it rains, I’ll go
to the gym – and the laundromat. Ten years from now… I want to be living
in some mountainous place.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Tibet?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Could be Tibet. Could be Colorado. Your
turn.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, Pogo – don’t keep him all to yourself.
Come on over, Lambert, join the group. We’ll buy you dinner, give you a
medal for saving Pogo’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Actually, I’m kind of tired, Ray. I’m taking
off.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Oh. I’ll… walk you to your car.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Least we could do. We don’t like her very much
– but we don’t want to lose her.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s not a great neighborhood. Maybe I
should walk you to your car.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t have a car.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Want a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Oh, thanks, but… I like to walk.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s starting to rain. Don’t be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah. If it’s no trouble. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay… ten years from now, what d’you want to
be doing?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t know. This is pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Can you drive okay?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m not drunk. You think I’m drunk? I’m not.
You’ll know I’m drunk when I’m throwing up, and I never throw up, so
don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: The only time I worry is when people tell me
not to worry.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Get in the car, will you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m on Lundy Street, just off Pico.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m good at this.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Streets are wet.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Are you one of those people who drive ten
miles an hour in the rain? I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I never drive.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Y’know, I can picture you in Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh yeah? What am I doing there?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Driving around… pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m not pissed off at you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Give me some time.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Those guys in the bar are my friends – sort
of. We work together, we tell jokes and we bullshit, but I can’t say to
them…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Every time I close my eyes, I see that
goddamn gun pointing at me and I don’t know why I’m telling you unless
it’s because you were there and because I had three drinks, but I’m not
ready to go inside and close my eyes and I don’t want to go to your
place and I don’t want to keep driving around, so what the hell do we
do?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Whew. I feel like we’re boxing, and you’ve
got me on the ropes. We’ll do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What I want is to know how you happened to
be walking by that parking lot at that minute. What if you hadn’ t been
there?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I guess we were supposed to meet.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If you want – you can come in for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sit down or something.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m circling awhile.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re not supposed to look around. I didn’t
have time to straighten up.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: So… it’s more real this way.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s rude.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Now that I’m in here, you seem mad about
it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m not mad. You’ll know when I’m mad. I
don’t usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That’s all. Let’s
talk about something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay – one thing I don’t believe is that
‘supposed to’ business. We were ‘supposed to’ meet. That sounds a little
fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You
believe that?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Some people say we each give off a particular
odor – that can only be detected by one other person’s brain.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So, we… smell each other? Who says that?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I have no idea. I’m more in the destiny
school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think
when we die – we come back in another form?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You mean like a duck? No. I think dead is
dead. I’ve been thinking about it all day – and I don’t want to think
about it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: See? Now you’re thinking about me.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Let me guess. Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s Austria, but I can’t picture myself in
Austria. I’m not good with languages, so I couldn’t qualify for the
departments over there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Thanks for… coming up here.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Does that mean I’m going?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No. You don’t have to. I…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You okay now?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh. You’re here as a medic.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Is this the mad part?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Maybe going is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Can I come back some time?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Must be the smell.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I better go.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey! Hey! What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s my car! What the hell were you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Nothing. I just…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I saw you! What did you take out of there?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No, I rolled up the window. It’s rain…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You take my phone?! Hah?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Hey! Hey! Wake up! Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I helped you. I helped you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Shopping day?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s looking great, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Thanks, honey. It’s the best year ever for
the impatiens. The very best.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Looks the same. Still smells like
cigarettes. I thought he quit.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s down to six a day.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Your hair looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Are you well?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I guess I’m well. Is this always here?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes. It’s always there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Did Larry tell you I came by where he’s
working? Is that why you called me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I called because we want to invite you to
our renewal of vows. It’s three weeks from Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Who’s ‘we.’ You said ‘we’ want to invite
you.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The family.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How come you’re renewing your vows?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s sort of… a fresh start.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Your idea?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No. Both of us. It’s a way of… having the
marriage blessed.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Wasn’t it blessed before?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sherry… of course it was blessed. You
just…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just what, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You just think about the bad, and you never
remember the good. I wish you remembered the good.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sorry. I wish I did, too. Does he? Remember
any good about me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Of course. He doesn’t hate you. He just…
still feels hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hurt? I hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Being arrested like that. Somebody doesn’t
forget that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh? How come you forgot what he did?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It wasn’t as bad – you always make it sound
worse. And it hasn’t been that way for years.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m glad it hasn’t been that way. That means
it worked, Mom. That was the point. That’s why I did it. Christ. Why do
I get punished for it?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Honey, nobody’s punishing you. We’re
inviting you. Will you come?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Of course I’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We didn’t think you’d want to.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We don’t want any trouble… on that day.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mom, I’m your daughter. I don’t want any
trouble – ever. I’ll come to the ceremony. I won’t come to argue, and I
won’t come in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s on the 23rd. Saint Monica’s.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’d like you to send me an invitation.
Mrs. Vander said it’s a beautiful invitation.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mom. I’d like to get one… in the mail… from
my family. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Tell Dad… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Do you have a machine?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Do you have an answering machine?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Will you hang up please, and I’ll call your
machine.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi. Maybe we can… have breakfast or
something. I get up early and run in Ballard Park. There’s a Denny’s
across from the park. Like eight or so. If you’re there, you’re
there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi, don’t pick up. Look, I didn’t sleep much
and anyway this is a bad idea. I was feeling funky last night and I’m
all right now so let’s just leave it where it’s at. Bye. Oh, thanks for
the… Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?! Who?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I was just falling asleep. Finally.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: We made a date.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It wasn’t a ‘date.’</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Okay, an ‘appointment.’ I keep my
appointments.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I called you. I called you at seven.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I get up early. I walked there. I waited
there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Check your messages.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I need more sleep. Come back in a month.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Come back? What makes you think I’d come back
here?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m here to tell you that when you tell
someone you’re going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his
life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate
instead of just…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s in the bag?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What? None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Did you bring some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You think you deserve coffee?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What else did you bring? Food?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You definitely don’t deserve food. I’ve got
coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Just black. Black. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So what kind of life did you rearrange in
order to get to Denny’s? You never said one word about yourself last
night. What d’you do?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s the difference?! You’re standing in
my bedroom. That’s the difference. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Somebody who keeps appointments.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re ducking. Don’t duck. Oh, shit –
you’re married, right?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You don’t believe me? Give me back the
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Give me the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, God. Oh, wait – you’re involved in some
criminal activity, aren’t you? Great – That’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: My name is Catch Lambert. I don’t work. I
don’t commit any crimes. I like being with you. We can start from here –
from now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Bullshit. I’m… I let you in here. I’m not
going to be some fool. I need the details.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: And I need to start from here.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s ridiculous. Why?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: That’s the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh. Your rules.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: My rules.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don’t really want to
know you anyway. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You live here? Nobody lives here. This place
is some kind of front, a scam, a drop – or what?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: This is what you told me about – right?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Your interrogation. Do I need a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just don’t want to be jerked around.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Then tell me straight out. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What is it you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Your life. I don’t want any surprises.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: This is it. I sleep here. I walk around town.
That’s all of it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s all of it?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah. Except for you – the way I feel about
you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Surprising. I thought it was impossible. I
thought I was…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You thought you were what? Gay?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Dead. In a way.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m supposed to understand that?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. Did you ever wonder what ‘scratch’ meant,
when people say, ‘we’ll start from scratch’? This is scratch. We can
start from here.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t know. I just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: I remember that. That was a smile.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You know the cop – the woman cop? She…
visited me.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Oh? Where did she sit?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I have a chair now.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: You’re… seeing her?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She has a lot of questions. She wants to know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Of course she does. Everybody does.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: We could start from today. What’s so wrong
with that?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Tell her.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Tell her what?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It’s been
almost two years.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Nora…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Every time I tell somebody, it gets a
little bit easier. I’m not saying it goes…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Nora!</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: She nice?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: She pretty?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: That doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: She is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She’s sort of pissed-off at me.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Apologize.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: It doesn’t matter. We like it when men
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m sorry I yelled at you.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Have a cookie. See?</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Sharon…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Anything bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why? What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Nothing. I’m talking about your general
attitude lately.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: My attitude’s fine. End of a long day. I’m
tired.</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Family matters getting to you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Family?!</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Your brother, Larry…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What about Larry?</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: You know Nester – on the Culver City
P.D.? He went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday. A neighbor
called it in. It got a little ugly. No arrest – a warning.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Larry. Oh Christ.</p>
<p><strong>sanderman</strong>: Nester said it’s not the first time.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Thanks for telling me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Jesus, you’re up early.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I wanted to catch you before you went to
work.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I thought you were on late shifts.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t sleep much. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where’s Kath?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She’s busy with Larry Jr. right now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hey, Champ.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Y’know, they call this one a woody ’cause it
has wood on the sides.</p>
<p><strong>larry jr.</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why’d you come by?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: To see Kathy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She’s not feeling good.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’ll just say hello.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Don’t make it worse.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It gets worse?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He’s okay now. He’s torn up about it. Don’t
make him mad.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: When Larry and I were growing up, our mother
said that all the time. ‘Don’t make your father mad.’ Has he hit Larry
Jr. yet?</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: He never would.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh. Just you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What d’you think you’re doing in my house,
Shar? In my home.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You see a pattern here, bro?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It
won’t…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: People always say that: ‘I’ve got a temper.’
Like it’s an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t need a goddamn lecture.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You want to hit someone? Next time your
‘temper’ flares up, Lar, and you just have to hit somebody, you go home
and hit your father.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You blame everything on him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m blaming you, you fucking coward.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You don’t come in here…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You don’t come in here and call me names.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What do you call a man who uses his wife as
a punching bag? Coward.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Don’t hurt her, Lar…!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I know how it feels, ’cause I remember. I
remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you – and
for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. And so did
I.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar,
knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I’ve got in my
hand? I’ve got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I’m thinking
of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I’m going to turn
you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, God. Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s you, right?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Can you just shut up? Just shut up and
listen.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t want to talk. I don’t care if you
have to play some game and pretend you’re a… ‘angel of mercy’ or…
whatever. I don’t care, but I don’t want to hear about it. All right? I
don’t want to hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s a bad night.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: This is good… but I’m too tired to stand up
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You want to kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Kiss me someplace I’ve never been
kissed.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why do you stop? You always stop.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: New day.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Catch?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Catch?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Drive, will you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Drive!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Will you get off this street?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What? You owe him money?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: If you take a right and stop – we can walk
from here. I’d rather walk.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If you’re in trouble…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If you’re in trouble with him, maybe I can
help.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Forget about him. Somebody I used to know. I
don’t want to know him anymore. That’s all. Forget about it. Walk with
me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: This is not a great place to walk.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I like it here. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I work here. It’s not fine.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes,
cart thefts? We’ve got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking ’em
over. Can’t catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight
and three. Can’t find him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You know everybody here?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Goin’ uphill, man.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You try it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Try what?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Go ahead. We need this. Everybody.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley
face.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Move your arm!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What are you staring at?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She feels bad ’cause you yelled at her.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What?! Who the hell do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: She just needs you to smile at her.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s none of your business!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why not smile at her? What’s it cost?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Who the hell are you to talk to me?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You’re so damn impatient.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You’re so busy being pissed off, and time is
going by.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s not her fault.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m calling the police!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. I’m calling the police. Hey – police.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Jesus Christ, Catch.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Maybe she’ll think about it now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You had no right to do that. God! You think
you know everything?! Who the hell are you, some expert on raising
kids?! The neighborhood angel?! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. No, I just… some people are walking
around blind…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s not your problem!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Don’t tell me what my problem is!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay, fine – you tell me what it is!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Maybe it’s not my problem. Maybe it’s your
problem. Maybe you’re going around blind.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Blind to what?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Blind to what’s going on around you. Blind to
what people need. We’re supposed to take care of each other. We’re
supposed to keep each other safe. That’s the way it should be – if
you’re not going around blind, like that woman…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Or like me, right? What about you? How come
you can see?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I think I’ll… walk the rest of the way on my
own.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yeah. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ll call you later – about the hiking.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’ll be out.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Shar… wait. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Do we go for… symmetry? Or… more off-center.
Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Are you into this? Bob?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I don’t want you around here.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Let’s go talk in the yard.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You took a swing at me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You asked for it – calling me a coward. You
knew I’d swing. You think I look bad now? Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops’ll love this,
right? Evidence. Don’t you guys love evidence?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You wanted me to swing.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m sorry I hit you so hard.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But you’re not sorry you hit me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy’s face?!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s not your business! Nobody called you,
right? She didn’t ask for you to come here. This is my family. You don’t
get it, ’cause you’ve got no family. Nobody. So you try to run everybody
else’s life. Jesus Christ – get your own life. That’s the goddam
problem. Get your own goddamn life.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Okay. I’m sorry I came here. I’m sorry I hit
you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Okay what?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t go to my department, all right?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Larry…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Because the job’s all I got.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That’s what I said, right? No life.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s what you said.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And you won’t come around here. You won’t
call. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And I don’t want you to come to Mom and Dad’s
celebration…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I
don’t want you around. I don’t want to see you, Shar.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Go get a life.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I got a life!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How the hell would you know about my
life?!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You know nothing about me, because you don’t
want to know. The family doesn’t want to know me. Well, too bad.
Sharon’s got a life. Sharon’s got a boyfriend. Sharon’s going hiking in
the morning with her boyfriend. She’s not sitting alone miserable like
you want. Too bad!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Hey. Hey! Can you wait up a minute?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I thought you walked all over the city.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can
we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I’ve burned every calorie I ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: My favorite lunch spot is another half
mile.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Up?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m not one of those competitive guys, you
know!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No thanks. I can’t eat and have a heart
attack at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: As soon as you get happy, you get sad.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m okay. Everything’s code four.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Everything’s what?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Fine? This isn’t fine. I know fine. This is
something else. Something happened yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yesterday – you mean you want to hear about
it?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Sure I do.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No kidding. Why? You never talk about
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: All my days are the same.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a
415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they
were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them
in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I
did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in
Sunset Park, old woman who’d been dead maybe six, seven days, and I
usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her.
Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her
little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real
tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head
mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother
Larry.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m sorry. That would make anybody sad.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sorry you asked?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. No, you can always tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Well… I feel better now. You feel
better?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I feel fine. Great.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch! There’s no swimming here! And you
can’t be naked in a state park!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Take the day off, Pogo!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What if a park ranger comes?!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Take your badge off for once. Don’t be such a
damn Marine about everything. Just…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Someplace I’ve never been kissed.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: They tell me I was in an accident. Long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Looks like a bad one.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t remember it. I…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We should be thinking about lunch. We have
to pack up.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: So soon?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Some of us have to work. You ever work?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah. I worked.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh? You remember that? Working?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Catch – Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How are you? Sit down. Been years. You been
out of town?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ve been around.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh, man, I’m really sorry about what happened.
I never got a chance to say…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: We don’t need to go there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Okay. All right. So… what d’you want, a
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I want my old job back. What d’you think?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You been workin’?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No, but I’m up to speed.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, it’s not good with Randal anymore.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, he’s out of it, but Danny Coley’s got
something going. Wanna go see ’im?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Finish your coffee.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I have to check these jacket pockets. What’s
your name – Allison?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I need to unsnap this, Allison. I’m checking
your waistband. You got to Whitney School?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: St. Mark’s.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball
team at St. Mark’s. You play basketball?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: What’s going on, Pogo? You’re not happy or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Well, it’s a mix, Robby. Life is shit, but
I’m dating this great dead guy.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He says before I came along, he thought he
was dead. Sounds better when he says it – Listen.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Shhh. Sh!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: The trumpet player.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: This time we got his ass.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Got ’im?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Look at that moon.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Full moon, man. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This guy’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>bat-man</strong>: This asshole side-swiped me!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Are you McGuire?</p>
<p><strong>bat-man</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mark McGuire?</p>
<p><strong>bat-man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Then put that bat away. Put it in your
trunk. Now.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I never touched his car.</p>
<p><strong>bat-man</strong>: You lying bastard!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Ow. Ow!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No. That’s good. Deeper.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: How heavy was this guy?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Like a truck.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: God. Tractor-trailer?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Pickup. Ow. Ow! That’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I better… More oil.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: This is pretty.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t get oil on it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Renewal of vows – that’s great. Is this your
parents?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yes. Just put it down. I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If I go, my brother’ll hurt me with the
department. I got mad and knocked him down. All they need is a
complaint. Just leave it alone and keep rubbing. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: So… he says you can’t go?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Can’t you rub without talking? It’s been bad
with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don’t
want me there, I don’t want to be there. All right?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: All right. Bad how?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: My father used to knock us around, all of
us. But I’m the one who called the cops – finally. They say I turned
against the family.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: But… they invited you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You don’t know anything about it. So forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Well… I know about family.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, yeah? What about it?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s… a door you don’t close.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I didn’t close the door.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You’re closing it now. Right? Family invites
you, you go. Family shows up, you welcome them in. That’s family.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, sure. What if they don’t deserve it?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Then you forgive.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You have all the answers.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. I just… It seems like a chance, doesn’t
it? A chance to make things right. I’d take it. Then you tried – y’know?
And it’s up to them.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You close with your family?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: See? So why should I listen to you?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What’s your favorite song?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch, I’m beat. So are they. I think
they’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: One more. It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Thanks, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Gonna be good having you back, Catch.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where I’ve never been kissed.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you in danger there?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I was talking to him, Pogo.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No thanks, Ray. Everything’s code four. Go
away.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: See that place? He’s going to be playing
there every weekend.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, yeah? What d’you play?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s music, Ray. You wouldn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You like these?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Well… They’re for you. We can pretend it’s
your birthday.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: They’re for me, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Yeah. I’ve… kind of been saving them up.</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: For Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Wow, Tommy – Look at them all. Did you say
thank you?</p>
<p><strong>candace</strong>: Excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Goddammit – I saw the kid. Jesus. I wasn’t
even close.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Wait a minute! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Why the hell did you cause a wreck?! I told
you – I saw the kid, you idiot. I was…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: One more word, and your life will change
forever.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch! Catch!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Are you all right? Your elbow’s bleeding.
I…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where are you going? Catch – you’re scaring
me. Please…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Please, Catch, don’t… Can’t you talk to
me?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Please. Wait. I… Catch!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Are you going to tell me why we’re sitting
outside this building again?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Watching for somebody. Tall guy. 40s.
Grey-blond hair.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Fine – what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Chill.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Hi! How are you? Have you been out in this
great afternoon? Brenda took me for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ve been… remembering.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Catch… This is good.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: No. No, there’s good to remember.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Catch?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Give me fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Excuse me – that’s a private entrance…</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Oh… is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m not sure. Who am I speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: I’m Dr. Pindella.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What kind of doctor?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Do you know a Catch Lambert?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Oh. Yes! Is he in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I… need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Well, I have a patient in five minutes.
But I can…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Are you a…?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: I’m a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: And Mr. Lambert…</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: My relationship with Mr. Lambert is
confidential.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He’s your patient. He’s your patient we…
know all this. This is police business. I’m officer Sharon Pogue –
L.A.P.D.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Look… I want to help Mr. Lambert but I
can’t tell you anything that isn’t public record.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: In general. In general. He’s your patient,
and he…</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: He’s not my patient. He walked away from
treatment. That was… nearly a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why did he walk away?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: I can’t discuss that, but if you know how
to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You can help by just telling me what’s in
the public record. It’ll take me half a day to do a search. Can you tell
me? Just…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Can you please tell me what’s in the
record?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: You were with him – in the car. Your
uniform threw me. Are you his friend?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: I can tell you he was in an accident,
hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What accident?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: A bus… a city bus hit his vehicle. That
was a couple of years ago. It was… an awful thing. His family was in the
van. His wife and child. His wife’s parents…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: A bus… and a van. Where? On… the
freeway?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: I think so. Yes. Near Santa Monica. On the
freeway. He was severely injured but… thrown clear. The others were
trapped in the van.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Survivors? Only him? I… don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Remember?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yes. I was there. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: His wife’s mother survived, but… she was
paralyzed.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: Elanora Chu. She’s still in town, I
believe.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Does he… still see her?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: He used to. I don’t know. I’m glad to see…
he has someone else who cares about him. I know he’s running from this.
He left all his friends, his home, his whole life.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He says… he doesn’t remember the
accident.</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help
him with that. He resisted. Walked away.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I think he remembers me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How does he live?</p>
<p><strong>pindella</strong>: He received a large settlement from the
city, but he…barely touches it. He was a professional musician.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch, it’s me. Can you pick up?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why don’t we… meet tomorrow? I’ll be in
Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o’clock.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Shar, I’m sorry about yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s hard to explain, but it’s… I’m okay
now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You don’t have to explain.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: So… why’d we meet here?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So you’re the trumpet player who was waking
people up – on my beat.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I used to practice late… outside. On my
roof.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: On your roof? That’s why we couldn’t find
you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I didn’t know it bothered anybody until you
mentioned it. You arresting me?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You going to tell me where we’re going?
That’s okay. I mean… I’ll go anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of death. The
mall on a Saturday. Just about any…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You can trust me, you know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’ve got you now. I’m holding on – like
before.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Like I held you before. Like I did – at the
accident.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What makes it so… unspeakable, Catch? What
makes it like that?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Is it because you were driving?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I read the reports, and it wasn’t your
fault. It wasn’t. Is it because you survived and they didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch. Please. Hold on, and we’ll go in
there together…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or
I love you or whatever…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: This is wrong! It’s wrong! Why are you doing
this?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: To help you.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I don’t need your help! I don’t need this. We
don’t need this – we’re fine…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We’re not. We’re not fine, Catch. Nothing is
fine – no matter how much you pretend.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You pretend that nothing happened. You walk
all over the city helping people, but you’re dying inside.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’m not dying! I’m not pretending! I don’t
remember! I don’t remember any of it. So leave me alone! What good does
it do? It’s gone! And I’m all right this way! Why do you have to change
it? I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Then walk in there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Walk in there, and I’ll walk in with you.
Walk in there and say it’s real – what happened is real. Your family
died.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Don’t talk about that! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: All right – you talk about it! You tell me
your family died and I say yes, I know, I’m sorry, and you say, I loved
them… and I say, what an awful thing to lose a family…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Damn you, Shar. Damn you – why won’t you
stop?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: So you can have a life!</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I have a life! We could have a life. We could
get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk
about before. We don’t need to do that! Why do we need to do that?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Because it happened! Because it’s the truth!
I’m sorry. I’m so sorry it happened, but…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Nothing happened! If we say it, then that’s
the truth, that can be the truth. Say it. Nothing happened. Say it,
Shar.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch – take my hand. Please.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Say it! I’m asking you to say it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Because I want it too much. I want
everything with you. I want all of you – not just the part that isn’t
hiding and running away…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why are you pushing so hard? Why does it have
to be your way? Why does it have to be your truth? This is who I am!
This is the way I am!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Not anymore. It doesn’t have to be this way
anymore because you’re not alone – because we’re the family now. We can
be the family…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You like to push people, don’t you? You just
have to push and shove and make it right for you – for you. You push
everybody, Shar. You even pushed your family away, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just… want to say…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: You already said it. You said it all.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: When you’re ready, I’ll be there for you. I
just want to say that.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rib House after shift today? 4:30?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: I think I’ll head home.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Pogo? Bring your friend.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No, I think I’ll turn vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Gotta have that meat to keep your strength
up.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How come it’s not working for you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Catch. Can you… pick up? Will you call
me?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Pogo…?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Which store is it?</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: The little market there. They came through a
back window last night. Mostly vandalism…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Whoa…</p>
<p><strong>skater</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>worried mother</strong>: Oh, God, thank you. Billy!</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Pogo?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: There’s something I have to do. I need an
address and phone.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: What’s the name?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Elanora Chu.</p>
<p><strong>robby</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Pogo?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m Sharon Pogue. I know all about the…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Elanora.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m sorry for… what happened. I know about
the accident.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: He told you?!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No. I found out, and… I remembered. I was
there.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Oh. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I guess he comes here a lot – to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: He shops for me. Twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh. And when he comes here – he never
mentions the past, never talks about the accident?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: And you… let him do that? All this time?
Why?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: It’s what he needs.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Walking all over the city like…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Like an angel. Yes. Sweet man.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: But… you let him get so lost.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: I let him find his own way through it. Why
did you come here, Sharon?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Because… I want to know how to help him.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: You are helping him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He… he was paying me back, I guess, for the
accident, for helping him. That’s why he felt… so close to me. But…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: But now he probably hates me.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I took him to the cemetery, and…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: The cemetery!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I thought it might help him… come back, you
know? But he wouldn’t even go in. He screamed at me.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: What made you take him there?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: For the truth…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: He knows the truth.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: But he won’t even say it, or…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: That’s his way. That’s his way through all
this. He made a wall – around that whole day, that night – other things,
too. He keeps them behind the wall – his little boy, my daughter. He
can’t help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to
the cemetery? Can you imagine?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: That’s where it stares you in the face –
the loss. And it’s too much sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: See? I’m still finding my way through it.
And Catch – it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a
car or see the place where it happened or… go by the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I was trying to help him… come back to some
kind of life. I…</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: But he was coming back. Do you realize how
much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is
coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon – for you. For
the two of you. Isn’t that coming back? Why do you have to rush?
Everybody has to rush these days.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I was scared. I push so hard… when I’m
scared.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Scared of what?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Losing him. So I did. I lost him. He won’t
talk to me. I… I didn’t know what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: You were finding your way. What else can we
do? You think I’m always sure what to say to him, what not to say? I do
what I think is right and hope he sees the love in it.</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: Look at you – so worried now, so miserable.
That’s the love in it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Did I… make it worse for him?</p>
<p><strong>elanora</strong>: I don’t know. I really don’t. But I think
he’ll see the love in what you did.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just came by to… wish you well. To…
congratulate you and wish you well. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: She came.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Don’t say anything. Think of your
parents.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Annie. Chet. I don’t… want you to think I
forgot about you. It’s just that I… I couldn’t find you. I woke up, and
you were gone. Everything was gone. It all just… disappeared. In one
minute. I couldn’t remember that minute. I lost it. It took me so long
to find it. I think I found it all now. I used a calculator. I did. I
figured it out. You know… we get about 1400 minutes a day and so I
figured it out. I was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so
it was… I’ve got it here…</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It was minute number 17 million eight hundred
ten thousand, two hundred… or so.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: That’s the one I lost. And… when I lost that
minute, I guess I tried to lose it all, all the memories – because they
hurt. I tried, but… I couldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Chet… you weren’t feeling so good, remember?
It was your birthday, and you ate too much.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: And, Annie, you said… you said…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Slow down in the rain, all right?</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: And I don’t know if I slowed down. I don’t
know. I hope I did, but… I didn’t always listen. I’m sorry. I’m really
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: … You put him on your lap, and he looked at
me, and I made a face. Remember? I made you smile, Chet.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: And then we all smiled, and it was a great
minute. It was. I’m really glad… I found that minute. No matter
what.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I won’t forget… anymore. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: All right. The whole family in this
one. Just…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where do you want me?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m the daughter.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Oh! Oh, well, how about…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You both look so great.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I just wanted to…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You coming to the party?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vander</strong>: Sherry! Look how nice you look.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Big police officer now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Not so big. Nice dress.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Larry…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How did you have the guts to walk into a
church after breaking your word?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I have to be here. It’s a chance to make
things right, and I’m taking it.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why even talk go me? You got what you wanted.
You laugh about it? You tell your cop friends how you…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You think I talk about it?! You think…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Here, Lar.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I was invited. I’m here. I’m going to the
party. You do what you want.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t make him talk about… anything
today.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Mom, I was going to fix his tie. His tie is
crooked.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It was a nice ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes. We’re running out of chicken, though.
Nobody’s eating the ham.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s a great party, Mom. You look happy.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Thirty-five years and still in love,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You think that’s wrong, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Of course not…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I always… I feel like apologizing to you.
But I love him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And then I feel like apologizing to him for
loving you. I’m the one in the middle. I’m the only one in this family
who knows how to forgive anybody.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Sorry about that, but… I couldn’t stand him
doing that to you. I took it on…</p>
<p><strong>kathy</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m not your mother. If he tries
it again, I’m gone. I’m out of there, me and Larry Junior. He knows
that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s up with you?</p>
<p><strong>larry jr.</strong>: They won’t let me watch T.V.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Oh. Well… let’s pretend this is T.V. It’s a
show about a party.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That man… is really a super hero.</p>
<p><strong>larry jr.</strong>: Is not.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Is too. And so is she. Look. See? Red tights
under her dress… Oh-oh, that man gave her a drink with something in
it.</p>
<p><strong>larry jr.</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: With stuff to make her sleep. He’s a bad
guy.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She drank it.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Watch. She’ll fall down any minute.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey, sport, you should go play outside.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Stay away from my family.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might
call the police.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Once the cops leave, we can really party.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Why don’t you give everybody a break – and go
home?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t walk away. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Is it working? Do you need to check it?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Dad…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sharon, please.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Please? Please what?! Will you stop
protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don’t talk to your
father. Don’t bother your father!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m going to bother you for one minute, Dad.
Okay? Can you handle that?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Just get the hell out…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: This isn’t about you, Larry – or you,
either, Mom. This is between me and my father, so leave us alone for one
goddam minute!</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How about you, Dad. Do you want me to
leave?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Up to you.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Dad… I’m asking. Am I welcome here?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jesus – you’re here, aren’t you? What d’you
want?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I want to know! Do you want me here? Do you
love me, Dad? I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Do you… need to… check that again?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I feel like…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What, Dad? You feel like what?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I feel like I don’t have a daughter
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Well… you do. It’s a shame you’re going to
miss knowing her. You’re going to miss all that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I’m next.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Y’know… being in this house reminds me of
something. I was about ten, I guess, and Larry and I were playing aliens
– remember, Lar? We’re making a lot of noise, and Dad comes home from
work tired and pissed off…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We’re yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into
the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I’m scared. I’m
really scared.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: And I say, we’re playing alien invasion,
Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I’ll show you a damn invasion, and he picks
me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that
couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch,
and then… then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we
came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he
tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we’re laughing so hard I
almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and
it was… it was great. It was great, and I’m never going to forget that.
Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just… I wanted to tell you tanks
for that, Dad. Thanks. That’s all. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Sorry, Shar. For what I said.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Was it bad?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: They don’t like me in there.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Then they don’t deserve you in there.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s a nice thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: It’s not a thing to say. It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: Why do you try so hard not to cry?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s not fair. Things got better for them
because of what I did. Things got better, and I’d still do it. I’d do it
all over again. And it’s not fair they shut me out. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s not fair. I was 19, and I didn’t know
what else to do. I didn’t know how else to stop it. It’s not fair I
don’t have a family anymore.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: No. It’s not, Shar. It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: We’re the family, Pogo.</p>
<p><strong>catch</strong>: I’ll drive.</p>
