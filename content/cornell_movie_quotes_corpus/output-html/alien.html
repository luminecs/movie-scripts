<p><strong>jay faust,</strong>: Engine Tech………….A worker.
Unimaginative.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh… God… am I cold…</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Is that you, Roby?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I feel like shit…</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Yeah, it’s you all right.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Ohh… I must be alive, I feel dead.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: You look dead.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: The vampires rise from their graves.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: We made it!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Is it over?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s over, Hunter.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Boy, that’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, how does it feel to be rich men?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Cold!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Okay! Everybody topside! Let’s get our
pants on and get to our posts!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Somebody get the cat.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’m going to buy a cattle ranch.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Cattle ranch!</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’m not kidding. You can get one if you
have the credit. Look just like real cows, too.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right, tycoons, let’s stop spending
our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Right. Fire up all systems.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Sandy, you want to give us some
vision?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Feast your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Where’s Irth?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Sandy, scan the whole sky.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Sandy, contact traffic control.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: This is deep space commercial vessel
SNARK, registration number E180246, calling Antarctica air traffic
control. Do you read me? Over.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I don’t recognize that constellation.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Dell, plot our location.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I got it. Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Just short of Zeta II Reticuli. We
haven’t even reached the outer rim yet.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: This is Chaz speaking. Sorry, but we are
not home. Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain
at your posts and stand by. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Chaz, I’ve got something here on my security
alert. A high priority from the computer…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Computer, you have signalled a priority three
message. What is the message?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: I have interrupted the course of the
voyage.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: I am programmed to do so if certain
conditions arise.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Computer, this is Captain Standard. What
conditions are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: I have intercepted a transmission of
unknown origin.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: A transmission?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: A voice transmission.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Out here?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: I have recorded the transmission.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Play it for us, please.</p>
<p><strong>strange, unearthly voice fills the room, speaking an
alien</strong>: LANGUAGE. The bizarre voice speaks a long sentence, then
falls silent.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Computer, what language was that?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Unknown.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Unknown! What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by
technological man.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Just hold it, hold it! Computer: have you
attempted to analyze the transmission?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Yes. There are two points of salient
interest. Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent
origin. Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human
palate.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, it’s finally happened.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: First contact…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Sandy, can you home in on that beam?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: What’s the frequency?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Computer, what’s the frequency of the
transmission?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: 65330 dash 99.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I’ve got it. It’s coming from ascension 6
minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Dell – show me that on a screen.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’ll give it to you on number four.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: That’s it. Let me straighten it out.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can you get it a little closer?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: That’s what I’m going to do.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Planetoid. Diameter, 120 kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’s tiny!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Any rotation?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Yeah. Two hours.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Gravity?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Point eight six. We can walk on it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, get the others up to the
lounge.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: If it’s an S.O.S., we’re morally obligated
to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I don’t know. Seems to me we came on this
trip to make some credit, not to go off on some kind of side trip.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Forget the credit; what we have here is a
chance to be the first men to contact a nonhuman intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: If there is some kind of alien intelligence
down on that planetoid, it’d be a serious mistake for us to blunder in
unequipped.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Hell, we’re equipped –</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hell, no! We don’t know what’s down there on
that piece of rock! It might be dangerous! What we should do is get on
the radio to the exploration authorities… and let them deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Except it will take 75 years to get a
reply back. Don’t forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: There are no commercial lanes out here.
Face it, we’re out of range.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Men have waited centuries to contact
another form of intelligent life in the universe. This is an opportunity
which may never come again.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Look –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You’re overruled, Martin. Gentlemen –
let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Dell, I want greater magnification. More
surface detail. I want to see what this place looks like.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s out of focus.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: No – that’s atmosphere. Cloud layer.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: My God, it’s stormy for a piece of rock
that size!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Just a second. Those aren’t water vapor
clouds; they have no moisture content.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Put ship in atmospheric mode.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Dell, set a course and bring us in on that
beam.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Activate lifter quads.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Activated. Vertical drop checked.
Correcting course. On tangential course now, orbiting. Crossing the
terminator. Entering night side.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Atmospheric turbulence. Dust storm.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Turn on navigation lights.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Approaching point of origin. Closing at
20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten. Five. Gentlemen, we are directly
above the source of the transmission.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’s the terrain down there?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Well, line of sight is impossible due to
dust. Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise. Infrared – noise.
Let’s try ultraviolet. There. Flat. It’s totally flat. A plain.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Is it solid?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: It’s… basalt. Rock.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Then take her down.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Drop begins… now! Fifteen kilometers and
dropping… twelve… ten… eight and slowing. Five. Three. Two. One
kilometer and slowing. Lock tractor beams.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Kill drive engines.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Engines off.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.
700. Hang on gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: And we’re… down.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Engine room, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Just a minute, hold it, I’m checking.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Has the hull been breached?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Uh… No, I don’t see anything. We’ve still
got pressure.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Martin, this is Jay. The intakes are clogged
with dust. We overheated and burned out a whole cell.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Damn it! How long to fix?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: How long to fix?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Well, get started.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Right. Talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s take a look outside. Turn the
screens back on.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Can’t see a blessed thing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Kick on the floods.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Not much help.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, we can’t go anywhere in this
darkness. How long till dawn?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Well… this rock rotates every two hours.
The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Good! Maybe we’ll be able to see
something then.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Or something will be able to see us.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: There could be a whole city out there and we’d
never see it.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Not sitting on our butts in here, that’s
for sure.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Just settle down. Sandy, you get any
response yet?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Sorry. Nothing but that same damn
transmission, every 32 seconds. I’ve tried every frequency on the
spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Are we just going to sit around and wait
for an invitation?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hello, Faust!</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: How’s it coming on the engines?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: I never saw anything as fine as this dust…
these cells are all pitted on a microscopic level. I have to polish
these things smooth again, so it’s going to take a while. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Sandy… how far are we from the source of
the transmission?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Source of transmission is to the
northeast… about 300 meters.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Close…</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Close enough to walk to!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, would you run me an
atmospheric?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: 10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon… and some
trace elements.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Nontoxic… but unbreathable. Pressure?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Ten to the fourth dynes per square
centimeter.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Good! Moisture content?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Zero. Dry as a bone.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Any microorganisms?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Not a one. It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yeah, rock particles. Dust.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, we won’t need pressure suits, but
breathing masks are called for. Sandy – can you rig up some kind of
portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its
source?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I volunteer for the exploration
party.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I heard you. You want to break out the
side arms?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’m sending. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Receiving.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Receiving.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right. Now just remember: keep away
from those weapons unless I say otherwise. Martin, do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Read you, Chaz.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Open the outer door.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Which way, Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You lead.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Okay, Martin. We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Okay, Chaz, I hear you. I’ve got you on my
board.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Good. I’m getting you clear too. Let’s
just keep the line open.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can’t see more than three meters in any
direction out here. We’re walking blind, on instruments.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: My signal’s fading.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’s the dust, it’s interfering…</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: … Hold it, I’ve got it again. It’s over
that way.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hell!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’s close, real close.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We should be almost on top of it. I just
can’t quite…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, uh, we’ve found it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Found what?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.
We’re going to approach it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: There are no signs of life. No lights… no
movement…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’re, uh, approaching the base.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Appears to be a door hanging open, the
entrance is clogged with debris.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Looks like a derelict.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, we’re going in. I’m going to hold
the conversation to a minimum from here on.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Air lock?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Let’s try and find the control room.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Look at these holes. This place looks like
Swiss cheese.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: This hole goes up several decks – looks
like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Climbing gear.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’ll go first.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, you’ll follow me.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Holy Christ…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Something has been scratched here… into
the veneer. See?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Keep away from that gun!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Just machinery.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: But functioning.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: That’s where the transmission is coming
from.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: A recording. A damned automatic
recording.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … This is the control room…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … Some details of the control room…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … This is the skeleton… another view of
the skeleton… the transmitting device…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … This is a closeup of the triangle we
found scrawled on the console in front of the skeleton…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … And that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Phenomenal. Staggering.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: We’ve got to go back and take a lot more
pictures, holograph everything.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: And bring back as much physical evidence
as possible, too. The rest of the skeleton. Some of the machinery.
Written records, if there are any.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I agree. This is the single most important
discovery in history.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: But?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What killed it?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Hell, that thing’s been dead for years.
Maybe hundreds of years. The whole planet’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: The way I figure it, they landed here for
repairs or something, then they couldn’t take off again. Maybe the dust
ruined their engines. They set up an S.O.S. beacon, but nobody came. So
they died.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: He died.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Not they… he…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: … There was only one skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Jay… how’s it coming on the repairs?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Well… I’m going to have to blow the engines
out…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: And when will you be ready to do that?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Oh – I’m not near ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Then why the hell are you sitting around
here?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: And there sits man’s first contact with
intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: You ready up there?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Sure, we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Okay. I’m going to start the extraction
procedure now.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Alas, poor Yorick.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Find anything we missed?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I don’t even know what I’m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Still worried?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh well… you know me.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’ve always respected your opinion,
Martin. If something worries you, it worries me.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What would you say that was supposed to
mean?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well… it’s obviously intentional… some
kind of attempt at communication… maybe it’s a symbol that means
something to them…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: But why draw it on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: This ship is full of cat hair.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Tell you what, Martin. As soon as the
engine’s fixed –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: This is Chaz.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Chaz, this is Dell. Can you come topside
for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Well, the sun just came up again, and it
seems the wind’s died down. It’s as clear as a bell outside. There’s
something I think you ought to see.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I was scanning the horizon to see what I
could pick up. Look there, on that screen.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What is it, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: This is Chaz. All hands topside. Now.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Doesn’t seem much doubt about it, does
there?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: That creature sure must have considered it
important… using his last strength to draw it…</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Maybe they built it.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: As what?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: A marker for buried instrumentation?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Or a mass grave.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Maybe the rest of the crew is in there –
in some kind of suspended animation, waiting to be rescued.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It wasn’t necessarily built by them.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Here comes the dust again.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, does anyone else agree with Martin
that we should not explore it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Then the sooner we get moving, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We can’t make out any details or features
yet… but it’s definitely too regular for a natural formation…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: … There’s one thing I can say for sure
though…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Now what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’ve completely lost their signal.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Can you get them back?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: This looks ancient.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can’t tell – these weather conditions
could erode anything, fast.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: There’s no entrance.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Maybe the entrance is buried. Could be
under our feet.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Maybe there is no entrance; the thing may
be solid.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Well, there ought to be some way we can get
through to them –</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Sorry to interrupt, but I’m gonna charge up
the engines for a minute, okay?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yeah, okay. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: I have a temporary sequence on the monitor
–</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hold it, I can’t hear a damn thing!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You mean… you’ve translated it?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Well come on, come on! What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What? What was that?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: The computer just translated the goddamn
message. It’s not an S.O.S. It was a warning.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Maybe we can get in by the top.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You want to try?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: You guys just wait down here till I say
it’s okay to come up.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: There’s a hole at the top.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can we come up?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: No, it’s too small, only room enough for
one person.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can you see anything in the hole?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I can see… partway down. It just goes
down like a stovepipe. Smooth walls. I can’t see the bottom – light
won’t reach.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Yes? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Jay, we’ve got a problem. I was wondering if
there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate
takeoff capability.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Why, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: The computer’s translated the alien signal,
and it’s kind of alarming.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It couldn’t translate the whole thing, only
three phrases. I’ll just read it to you the way I got it:</p>
<p><strong>not land… “</strong>: And that’s all it could translate.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Dell, you want to come down, we can figure
out where to go from here.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: No, I want to go in.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Okay, Dell, but just for a preliminary
look-around. Don’t unhook yourself from your cable. And be out in less
than ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Okay, I’m in the mouth of the chimney
now, and I’m starting down.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: It’s noticeably warmer in here. Warm air
rising from below.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Are you okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay. Haven’t hit bottom yet.
Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of
dust.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What was that Dell, I lost you, do you
read me?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Yeah, but this is hard work. Can’t talk
now.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’m way below ground level.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I couldn’t make it out – too much
interference.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’m getting nowhere. The whole area around
the pyramid is dead to transmission. I think we should go after
them.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What do you mean, no?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: But they don’t know about the translation!
They could be in danger right now.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We can’t spare the personnel. We’ve got
minimum takeoff capability right now. That’s why Chaz left us on
board.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Why, you chickenshit bastard –</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Just can that crap! I’m in command here till
Chaz returns! And nobody’s leaving this ship!</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Tunnel’s gone – cave or something below
me – feels like the tropics in here; air is warm and humid… … high
oxygen content, no dust, it’s completely breathable –</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: It’s unbelievable! It’s like some kind of
tomb… some primitive religion! Hey, is anybody there? Do you read me?
Standard!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: If we don’t hear from him soon, I think we
better go in after him.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Sun will be down in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I don’t know if you can hear me, but the
place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on
the other ship – except these are all sealed. Also they’re soft to the
touch.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Another funny thing – I just put my hand
on it, and now there are these raised areas appearing where my
fingertips were.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Here’s his line. We can haul him out of
there if we have to.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’ll yank him right off his feet if he’s
not expecting it. The line could get tangled in something.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: But what can we do? He’s out of radio
contact.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Maybe we should just wait a few more
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, I told him to be out in ten minutes.
It’s been much longer. Let’s get him out of there.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The line’s slack. Christ, do you think the
idiot unhooked himself?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: There, it caught!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on
something?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, it’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Can you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, I can’t see far enough. The line’s
moving, though.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I can see him! Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Get ready to grab him!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Look out! There’s something on his
face!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Don’t touch him, watch it!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Oh God, oh God no.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Help me – I’m going to try to get it
off.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It won’t come – it’s stuck.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How the hell should I know? Come on, give
me a hand, let’s get him out of there!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’ve got ’em! They’re back on my
screens!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Three blips! They’re coming this way!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hey, can you guys hear me?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Yeah, we hear you! We’re coming back!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Thank Christ! We lost you! Listen, there’s
been a new development –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can’t talk now; Broussard’s injured. We’ll
need some help getting him into the ship.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Jay, this is Cleave! Meet me at the main air
lock!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Martin, I’m by the inner lock door! I’ll
wait here for you to let them in!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Don’t know – Broussard got hurt somehow.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hurt! How?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Don’t know – maybe we’ll be real lucky and
he just broke his neck. I knew we shouldn’t of come down here.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Here, Chaz.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’re coming up now, open the outer lock
door.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Chaz – what happened to Broussard?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s some kind of organism, it’s attached
itself to him. Let us in.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You hear me, Martin? Open the outer
door.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Chaz, if it’s an organism, and we let it in,
the ship will be infected.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We can’t leave him out here, open the
door.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Chaz, listen to me – we’ve broken every rule
of quarantine. If we bring an organism on board, we won’t have a single
layer of defense left.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, this is an order! Open the
door!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Outer door’s open.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You men stay clear, there’s a parasite on
him.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Oh – God – oh –</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Is it alive?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I don’t know but don’t touch it. Give us a
hand here, let’s get him up to the Autodoc.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Help me, come on, let’s get him up
here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: That thing, God almighty, didn’t you try to
get it off him?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It wouldn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Medical gloves.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s really on there tight.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Here, let me try.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Stop it, you’re tearing his face.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’s not coming off – not without his
whole face coming off too.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s let the machine work on him.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Hey now, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I understand why you did that.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: He wouldn’t open the lock; he was going to
leave us out there.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Yeah… well, maybe he should have. I mean,
you brought the goddamn thing in here. Maybe you deserve to get
slapped.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Excuse me, I’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I
don’t like hitting.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I guess I had it coming. Let’s call it
settled.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Would somebody fill me in?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: He went into the pyramid alone. We lost
radio contact with him. When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It
won’t come off, not without injuring him.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: He’s the only one that knows that.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: How does he breathe?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Blood’s thoroughly oxygenated.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are
blocked.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s look inside his head.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What is it – I can’t tell anything –</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It’s some kind of organ – it’s inserted some
kind of tube or something down his throat.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Oh… God…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I think that’s how it’s getting oxygen to
him.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense. It paralyzes him…
puts him into a coma… then keeps him alive.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We can’t expect to understand a life form
like this. We’re out of our back yard. Things are different here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Well, can’t we kill it? I mean, we can’t
leave the damn thing on him.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We don’t know what might happen if we
tried to kill it. At least right now it’s keeping him alive.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: How about cutting it off? We can’t pull it
loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it’s
stuck to his face.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You’re right… we can’t stand here and do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Somebody give me a scalpel.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’ve made an incision… it’s not reacting…
but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Hold it, this stuff’s smoking!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: God, that smoke’s poisonous!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It’s eating a hole in the floor!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That stuff’s eating right through the
metal! It’s going to eat through the decks and right out through the
hull!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: There! Look!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Jesus, what can we put under it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: There. Should be coming through about
there.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Careful, don’t get under it!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Christ, that stinks.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Seems to have stopped penetrating.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What’s happening up here?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I think it’s fizzled out.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I never saw anything like that in my life…
except molecular acid.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: But this thing uses it for blood.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Hell of a defense mechanism. You don’t
dare kill it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s stopped?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Yes, thank heaven.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’re just plain lucky. That could have
gone right through the hull – taken weeks to patch it.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Reminded me of when I was a kid and the
roof leaked – everybody running for the pots and pans.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: My God, what about Broussard?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Did it get on him?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, thank God… just missed him.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Is it still dripping?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It appears to have healed itself.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It makes me sick to see him like that.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Isn’t there some way we can get it off
him?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I don’t see how. But let’s do what we can
for him.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I think we’d better get some intravenous
feeding started. God knows what that thing is leaching out of him.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Look there, what’s that stain on his
lungs?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It appears to be a heavy fluid of some
sort… it blocks the X-rays…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: That tube must be depositing it in him.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Could be some kind of venom, or
poison…</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: This is horrible.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hey! what about the film?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What film?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Broussard had film in his datastick, didn’t
he? We can see what happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: That must have been when he got it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: The same thing must’ve happened to the
creatures on the other ship… except they took one of those jars on
board, and opened it there.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: slides to a picture of</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I personally can’t make any sense out of
it…</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It’s a crude symbolic language – looks
primitive.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: You can’t tell – that kind of stuff could
represent printed circuits…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That sounds a little fanciful…</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Primitive pictorial languages are based on
common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting
point for translation…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What common objects?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Listen, hadn’t somebody better check on
Broussard?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’ll do it. The rest of you continue.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You know, it’s fantastic – the human race
has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form,
and now we run into a veritable zoo.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well, those things out there aren’t the
same, you know – the spaceship and the pyramid. They’re from different
cultures and different races. That ship just landed here – crashed like
we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: How could anything be indigenous to this
asteroid? It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Maybe it wasn’t always dead.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Now we’re in for it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The door was closed. It must still be in
here.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, don’t open the door. We don’t want it
escaping.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Well, what the hell good can we do in here?
We can’t grab it – it might jump on us –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Maybe we can catch it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: As long as we’re careful not to damage
it…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I think it’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Look at these suckers – no wonder we
couldn’t get it off him.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Is that its mouth?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: More likely that organ – the tube- like
thing – fits up in there.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Quick – it’s decomposing – gimme something
to grab it with!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Christ! Let’s get it out of here!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: For Chrissake, open the main lock!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: My God, it’s lethal even when it’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How’s Broussard?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: He’s running a fever.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Still unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can you do anything for him?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: The machine will bring his temperature down.
His vital functions are strong.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I need some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: These day and night cycles are totally
disorienting. I feel like we’ve been here for days, but it’s only been
how long?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: About four hours.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’m sorry to say it looks like you were
right in the first place, Martin. We never should have landed here.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Look, I’m not trying to rub anybody’s nose in
anything. The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I can’t lean on Faust any harder – he’s
been working non-stop on the engines.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: If we knew exactly what happened to the beings
on the other ship –</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We do know that.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: They never made it off the planet. The
parasites won.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Where did the parasites come from?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: They seem native to the planet. It’s got
an atmosphere and a dense gravity. It’s dead now, but once it must have
been fertile.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: No. It’s just too small to support fauna
as big as the parasites. If there were a native ecology, it would have
to be microscopic.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Couldn’t the pyramid have been built here by
space travellers?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Too primitive. It’s a pre- technological
construction. That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at
best.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: They’re from a dead civilization; they’re
spores from a tomb. God knows how long they’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I think we better take another look at those
heiroglyphs.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hey, guess what?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: The engines are fixed.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Switch on tractor beams.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Lock tractor beams.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Retract landing struts.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Take us up.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Up one kilometer, Jay.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Switch on lifter quads.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Engage artificial gravity.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Engaged.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s take her into an escape orbit.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I’m altering our vector now; should give us an
easy escape velocity –</p>
<p><strong>roby &amp; melkonis</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: This dust is getting clogged in the intakes
again!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Just hold us together till we’re in space,
that’s all!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We made it! Damn, we made it!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You bet we made it. Martin, set course for
Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: With great pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I feel like an escapee from Hell.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: That’s the part that always makes me feel like
I’m gonna puke – when we accelerate into light speed.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Quit complaining; we’re in space.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I think the best thing to do with
Broussard is to just freeze him as he is. It’ll arrest the progress of
his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back
to the Colonies.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We’ll have to go into quarantine, maybe for
quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That’s okay, he can remain in hypersleep
until they’re ready to treat him.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: … Mouth’s so dry… can I have some
water…</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How do you feel, Dell?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Wretched. What happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Don’t remember nothing. Can’t hardly
remember my name.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Are you in pain?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: Not exactly, just feel like somebody’s
been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Hell, you’re in great shape, you’ve got
your sense of humor back!</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: God I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Dell, what’s the last thing you can
remember?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: … I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Do you remember the pyramid?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: No. Just some horrible dreams about
smothering. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’re going home. We’re in hyperspace.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We’re going into the freezers now.</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I’m really starving; can we get some food
before we go into the freezers?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I think that’s a pretty reasonable
request.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Boy do I feel a lot better. It’s a straight
shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the
paydirt. Any bets on the top bid?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Well, we should at least be able to each buy
our own planet.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I’m going to write a book about this
expedition. I’m going to call it “The Snark Log.”</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The commander normally has first
publication rights.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Maybe we could write it together.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: First thing I’m going to do when we get back
is eat some biological food.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: What’s the matter, you don’t like this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Tastes like something you’d feed a chicken to
make it lay more eggs.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Oh it’s okay. I’ve had better cag than
this, but I’ve had worse too, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: I kind of like it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You like this shit?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It grows on you.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You know what they make this stuff out of?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Yes, I know what they make it out of, so
what? It’s food now. You’re eating it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I didn’t say it was bad for you, it’s just
kind of sickening, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Do we have to talk about this kind of crap
at the dinner table?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: I don’t know… I’m getting these</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Breathe deeply.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What Dell – what?</p>
<p><strong>broussard</strong>: OhmygooaaAAAHHHHH!!!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Oh, no. Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: What was that? What the Christ was that?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: It was growing in him the whole time and
he didn’t even know it!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: That thing used him for an incubator!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We can’t go into hypersleep with that
thing running around loose.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We’d be sitting ducks in the freezers.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: But we can’t kill it. If we kill it, it will
spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ll have to catch it and eject it from
the ship.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but
all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of
time out of suspended animation… and as you know, we used up most of
that time in harvesting.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ve got about a week left, right?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: And then we run out of food and oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: The water will still recycle.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We won’t need it then.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right, so that’s what we’ve got. A
week. It’s plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: But if we haven’t caught it in a week, then we
have to go into the freezers anyway.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: So does anybody have any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: We could put on our pressure suits and blow
all the air out of the ship. That would kill it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, we can’t afford to lose that much
oxygen. We’re going to have to flush it out.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Room by room, corridor by corridor.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: And what do we do when we find it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ll have to trap it somehow. If we had a
really strong piece of net, we could bag it.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: We could cut a section out of that metallite
netting. It won’t hold up to that acid, but aside from that it’s pretty
strong.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We have to avoid injuring it. What we really
need is some electric animal prods.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I think I could cobble something together. A
long metal rod with a battery in it. Give it a hell of a shock.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Good. Get on it. But first, I’m issuing a
standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear
protective garments, including helmets. Let’s get down to the locker and
change.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I thought I’d find you here.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I was thinking of a line from an old poem:
“Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.” All that space out
there, and we’re trapped in this ship.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That’s the one about the albatross,
right?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We can’t even radio for help; the carrier
wave wouldn’t reach its destination till long after we’d died and turned
to dust. We are utterly, absolutely alone. Can anybody really visualize
such a scale of distances? Halfway across Creation…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We came out there, we’ll go back. A long
time by the clock, but a short time to us.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Time and space have no meaning out here.
We’re living in Einsteinian equation.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I can see you’re putting your spare time
to good use. Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace
for long enough, they’ll be peeling you off a wall. I’ve seen it
happen.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We’re the new pioneers, Chaz. We even have
our own special diseases.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Come on – let’s go above and see how
they’re coming with the gear.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: These have portable generators in them.
They’re insulated down to here – just be careful not to touch the
end.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Might even incinerate the damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Don’t worry, it won’t damage it, it’ll just
give it a little incentive.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How do we locate the creature?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: With these.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Tracking device. You set it to search for a
moving object… It hasn’t got much range, but when you get within a
certain distance, it starts beeping.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: These will be very useful. At least we
won’t have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands. All
right, here’s the battle plan: we’re going to break into two teams and
start systematically covering the ship. Whoever finds it first, catches
it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Even simple.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: For starters, let’s make sure the bridge
is safe.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right – Roby and Melkonis will go with
Faust. Hunter and I will make up the second team.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ll all carry communicators. We want to
keep in constant touch.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Nothing yet… nothing… we can move pretty fast
as long as there’s nothing on the tracker.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: I’ve got something.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Where’s it coming from?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Machine’s screwed up, I can’t tell. Needle’s
spinning all over the dial.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Is it malfunctioning?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: No, just confused. It’s coming from below
us.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What happened to the lights?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace
’em.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It’s within 4 meters.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh, hold it!</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: We’re making fools of ourselves!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ve got it up here! It’s trapped! Get up
here fast!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Food-storage room!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: We’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We saw it inside and slammed the door on it!
It’s in there now!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What’s it doing, having a seizure?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It started crashing around right after we
locked it in.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I guess we open the door and net it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I hate to open that door.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It looks completely different from the
first one – it’s more like a worm with legs… and tentacles.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Well we better do something.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Maybe we don’t have to. It’s trapped in
there. We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Don’t be an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: I know what we can do. We can pump poison gas
into the room and kill it. Through those ventilator slots there.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hey, wait a minute! That’s all our food
supplies in there! We can’t pump poison gas all over them!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Once we kill the thing we won’t need the
food any more – we can go straight into hypersleep. Also, it sounds like
that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be
fouling them all.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You win.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Somebody gimme a hand, I’ll get the
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Get those masks on.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: This stuff’s deadly – I hope we know what
we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Go ahead, Jay.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Shut it off.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What do you think? Now we go in.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Looks like he helped himself.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: God damn it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It escaped.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Where does that go?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: All over the ship; we’ll have to check the
charts to know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Then let’s go and do it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Have we got any food at all left in the
ship?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: That one section of the ventilator shaft has
only two outlets – you notice? The food storage room on one end –</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: – And the cooling unit on the other.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: So it’s trapped in between – now we have
to drive it out.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Poison gas…</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We can’t pump poison gas down into the
cooling unit! It’ll flood the whole ship!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The only other thing I can think of is for
somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The man would need protection, obviously –
as well as some way to drive the thing before him.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: How about a flamethrower? That wouldn’t
poison the air.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: So one of us goes into the airshaft and
drives the thing along –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: While the rest of us wait down in the
cooling unit with the net.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Sounds like a rough one.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: So the only question left is: who gets to
crawl down the airshaft?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s be democratic.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Martin, take one.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Open it up, Cleave.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Well, uh… good luck. I hope you won’t need
me, but if you do, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Hey, do you guys read me down there?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Yeah, we’re getting into position.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Okay, I’m starting now.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: There. That’s where it’s got to come out.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: That’s a flip-flop gate to channel the air,
but we can use it to trap the thing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Right now let’s keep it closed.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: I’ve got Hunter… and something else as
well, in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Are they close?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: They’re on the next level up.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s get moving with this net.</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: They’re getting pretty close now.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right, then – when it gets to the
other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>melkonis</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: And you and I will bag it, and then we’ll
take it to the ventral air lock, got it?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Hey, you guys.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: I don’t think this shaft goes on too much
farther… anyway it’s getting pretty hot in here…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Okay, our screens show you as being near
to the opening. We’ll open it up, then we’ll cue you and you can start
blasting. That’ll drive it right out. You don’t have to go any
farther.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Okay, get ready.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Open the vent, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What happened? Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: How did it get so big?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: By eating our food supplies.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Where’s Melkonis?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Hey, are you guys still there? What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Meet us on the bridge. Be careful – it’s
huge now.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: You mean his body was still kicking when it
ran off with him?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It was horrible – horrible. Like a
chicken.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: What happened? Where’s Sandy?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Dead!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It’s monstrous – it grew, like some horrible
tapeworm. We were completely unprepared.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It’s still in the ship?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’d better seal off the lower maintenance
level; at least trap it there.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: At least it can’t get up here now.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Two down, four to go.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Listen, it sure didn’t like this
flamethrower.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That’s right – we can’t kill it on the
ship, but we can at least keep it at bay – and maybe drive it into the
air lock.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Thing is, I’m about out of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: There’s some more combustible fuel down in
the storage lockers next to the lounge. I’ll go get it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, I don’t want us separated.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: You just sealed it off; it can’t get to that
section.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Don’t count on it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We sure need this flamethrower.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right… but do not go below decks.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: And be right back.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I think it’s time we took a hard look at those
heiroglyphs.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Can you make out any pattern in all that?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well… yes… there’s a pattern… but it’s
meaningless to me.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I know it looks like a senseless jumble, but
if you look closely, there are recognizable forms.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Recognizable! In that?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: In symbolic form… very stylized… but if you
stare at it, you can see some of the different creatures we’ve been
dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Well… I suppose that star-shaped thing could
be the parasite that got on Broussard. Is that what you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: And right next to it, that oval design with
the markings – it’s a dead ringer for the spore casings.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That next thing there – six legs,
tentacles – that’s the thing we saw in the food locker.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: So the next step should be –</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: – The big one. And there it is.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: This is all the same creature. We’re seeing
the different stages in its life-cycle.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Then that tomb… must have been some kind
of fertility temple… where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating
rituals…</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: … And Broussard got caught in their
reproductive cycle.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You will notice, though, that there are no
more phases. Only four forms are shown. After that the pattern
repeats.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Which presumably means…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: … More spores coming.</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It’s in the lock – blow the main lock.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>faust</strong>: It’s in the main air lock. Blow the lock.</p>
<p><strong>faust screams in mortal agony as the inner door closes on his
waist,</strong>: crushing him to a thickness of about three inches.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: How much oxygen did we lose?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ve got six hours left.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Does anybody know what happened?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air
lock door. His body held it open.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Can we get to him?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: No, I had to seal off a whole section. We’d
lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Poor kitty; puss puss puss.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: At least we’re rid of the damn monster. It
must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: No such luck. I saw it running down one of the
corridors.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Oh no! We can’t fight this thing! There’s
only six hours of air left – we’re dead men!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I don’t buy that. There’s still time to
destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s time for drastic remedies.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It was time for that a couple days ago.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That kind of remark is pointless. Now come
on – I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how
wild.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We can’t kill it on board. It’s huge now and
must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I’ve got an idea, but you’re not going to like
it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Okay. First we shut down all the cooling
systems on the stardrive engines.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That’ll blow the ship up.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Right… but it’ll take a few minutes for the
engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in
the lifeboat and leave the ship.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Blow the ship up?</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: And the creature with it. We can make it back
to Irth in the lifeboat.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: But the lifeboat can’t accelerate to light
speed.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Doesn’t matter – we’re already at light speed.
And when we get back to the Colonies, they’ll pick us up in the
network.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What about all the minerals and elements in
the cargo hold? That’s the only reason we came out here. We’d have to
abandon them all. We’d be broke.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can
take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the
lifeboat.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No, it won’t work and I just realized why.
There’s only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us
could survive.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Yeah… I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: But the idea’s good, if we could just turn
it around somehow.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: If we could just get the creature into the
lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Good! That’s good!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We can load the lifeboat up with
explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I think it’s going to be almost impossible to
drive it up into the lifeboat.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: We can use the flamethrower.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: It’s not going to work.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You can’t say that; I think it’s a good
plan.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: The flamethrower needs more fuel.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Right. We’ve got a lot to accomplish.
Let’s get moving.</p>
<p><strong>long racks of shelves are stocked with metal containers of
various</strong>: SHAPES. Each container is well packed and
labelled.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Which explosive should we use?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I’d suggest the N-13 sticks. They’re
portable, and they can be radio detonated.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: You know, it’s funny – this stuff we went to
so much trouble to dig up – this treasure, the paydirt – it’ll make it
back to Irth just fine – even if we’re not with it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Here, carry these.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hey watch it!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It’s stable; it doesn’t hurt to drop
it.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish
loading the explosives into the boat – or do we flush it out now?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Now. If we can get it into the boat, we
won’t have to blow it up – we can just eject it into space.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: You can come up! It’s safe!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Oh – Jesus –</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: The ship’s gravitational attraction must
have drawn him back.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Should we go outside and bring him in?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No… the risk is too great. Perhaps after
we’ve destroyed the thing.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Along the base of the walls there.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: This should do it.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I should hope so! And we’d better make sure
it’s pretty far from the ship when we blow it.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: It will be.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What we really need is some red meat in here
for bait.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Well, if we had some, I’d eat it. I’m starting
to get hungry.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Well… now we have to herd that thing up
here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Whoever’s doing the herding is gonna have
their hands pretty full. I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to
slam the door on the thing once it’s inside, and to serve as… as…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Isn’t “bait” the word you used?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Hey look, somebody has to have his hands
free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it
too… if the others are injured.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Who gets the privilege?</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER. Three hands
pick them up.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Just keep your finger off the button till
she’s way away from the ship, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Is it armed?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: If you press the button right now, it will
blow the whole nose of the ship off.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Thanks for the thought.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: All right, Martin, we’ll be in touch with
you on the communicator.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: And you’ll let me know when you’ve got it
coming this way…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: And you stand aside while we drive it in,
then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and –</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Kablooey.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Come on; we haven’t much time, air is a
factor.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: We’ve got something on the tracker… got to
be it, it’s too big for the cat.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It’s coming from down there.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: It must have stopped moving. I’m not getting
anything.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Let me go first; you stay behind me.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: The flamethrower!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: I can’t, the acid will pour out!</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Hello? Standard? Hunter?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Kill me…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What did it do to you?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: That was Melkonis… it ate Hunter…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: I’ll get you out of there.</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No… don’t…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: But I can save you – get you to the
Autodoc!</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: No good… it’s eaten too much of me…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>standard</strong>: Kill me…</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: Kitty go bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>roby</strong>: What’ll it be, Kitty? Here – how about some
Tacitum-35, ten kilos of it. This’ll buy us an island on some nice
planet.</p>
