<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Why are we slowing down?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: We’re stopping. Why are we stopping?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I don’t know, mother. No idea.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Excuse me, why has the train stopped?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: It’s the crowd, ma’m, the people. They’re
blocking the track.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Long live Tolstoy! Long live the old
warrior!</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But if they block the track, the train can’t
go…YOU HAVE TO MAKE</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Oh, they won’t move. We are gonna die here.
Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It’s the only way we are gonna
get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I have seen your banner. And I�ve heard
what you say. You think I�m the hope of Russia, do you? Well, that�s not
true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say,
you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a
fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a
poor old men get on with his.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Do you know who that is? That is the
greatest man in the world.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Darling.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: But sex… You are twenty three. Not an easy
age for abstinence, is it?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Tolstoy does not approve of sexual
relations. I know this.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: He despises them, in fact…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I don’t want to belabor the point, but I
arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids
just like that. He was very upset.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: This would not be a problem. I’m celibate.
I’m also a strict vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Yes, I’ve heard many good things about
you. I’ve even read what you`ve written. So has he.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: My dear boy, if you were to become
Tolstoy’s private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You’ll be
with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan, I
have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas,
improving my very soul.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get
his work to the people.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of
passive resistance…just think of it Valentin thousands of ordinary
Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political
oppression-</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: In the name of truth and freedom.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy,
there are so many enemies-</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Enemies?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: The Czar’s police…You’ll be followed when
you leave here…and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back
into the fold. His children can’t be trusted… only Sasha… and then of
course there is the Countess… Well, one doesn’t like to come between
married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to
private property, her public criticism of our movement…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: And although they’ve allowed me to return
to Russia, I can’t see him. They keep me under house arrest… They might
as well keep me in a cage.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: So, I need you to put these letters
directly into his hands. One can’t be sure what gets through to him.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Sofya Andreyevna does not respect his
privacy.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: She wouldn’t open his private
correspondence…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I have another task for you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’ll keep a diary for me.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I need to know everything that goes on at
Yasnaya Polyana. Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the
copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come
and go. Anything Sofya Andreyevna says.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: She’s very, very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Godspeed, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: And remember what I said.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Write everything down! Go!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Nothing’s working… Hand me my other boot,
my friend, will you?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Let me finish.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It doesn’t matter. If my heart had stopped
beating, I’d still go riding today.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Your pulse is my responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: This is impossible! It really is! These
people are parasites! Look… “Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from
her husband. They barely speak.”</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You know who spreads all this rubbish….</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: C’est la meme en France. They gossip about us
in Paris… “They do not share a similar view of either religion or
politics.” Incroyable!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Peut-etre. You think that’s inaccurate?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I think it’s none of the world’s
business.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: What are you doing? Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Dushan Petrovich, you’re scribbling
again?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Darling, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Riding with Sasha. Don’t expect us for
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like
that.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Like the man who looks after the sheep.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It’s not meant to offend you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But it does offend me, because it offends
reason. You’re a Count, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Oh darling, I have something else to say.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I doubt it not, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: He’s forgotten his coat.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Count Tolstoy, you’ve forgotten your
coat.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Let him walk. Let him walk.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: Count Tolstoy, you’re no doubt
distressed by the Czar’s treatment of your secretary Nikolai Gusev ?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: These people are bandits.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: I said, let him walk.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: They come into my house and arrest a man
whose only crime is to express a view of life saner than that which
prevails.</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: So Gusev is innocent?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Of course, I’m the guilty one. I reject the
Orthodox church. I condemn the established order and I make no secret of
it.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Let him walk. Let him walk. But you don’t
banish these people very much to your credit…I wish I had your largeness
of spirit.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Papa.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sasha!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Did you ride this morning?</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Telyatinki was created by Vladimir
Grigorevich as a center for the movement. Just last week we had a
visitor from India. We talked to the group about the healing properties
of cobra venum.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Oh, goodness..It’s a beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Yes, but we will pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: The meeting room is behind us. This is
the tool shed. The dormitory ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Telyatinki is a place of freedom.
Nothing is forbidden here.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Each man is alone with his conscience
and his God. The kitchen is below. You’ll be expected to assist with
meals at least twice a week …and to give a hand in the garden. We’re all
equals here, you know…as Tolstoy teaches us.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Yes… you’re lucky….We’re all
envious.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you
begin your reports as soon as possible. You have the notebook he gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: You understand we must keep the
existence of the diary a secret.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Just that…secrecy doesn’t seem to me the
essence of Tolstoy’s thought.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: But you’ll admit, you’re no expert.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Yes, I…I’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: If we’re spared.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’ve brought you a glass of tea.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: That’s very kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: It’s your first day. Enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You met Sergeyenko?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Last night.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Ad what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He seems very sincere.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Thank you. Why are you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Say that again.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I said he seems very… Why?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I just arrived…What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Masha. But you should still say what you
think. Not just about him. We all should.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Thank you for the tea.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Tomorrow you can make your own.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: He’s a sorry old tight-assed stick in the
mud…but yes, he’s sincere.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Hello…hello…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re the new secretary.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Papa’s out. You can wait in the library. Ivan
will show you up.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’m glad you’re here. So glad.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m… I’m… Here is-</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m sorry. Sometimes I…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Vladimir Grigorevich has already written
about you at length. I need your help badly. The manifesto against the
government is hard work. They commit their idiotic abuses faster than I
can catalogue them…and the new book…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He told me about it…It’s very
exciting.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’ve become convinced that all the world’s
religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is?
Love! Love! Simple… Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was
your journey? Come, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You know, I was born on this sofa…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sit. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Myself, my brother, my children, at least
five or six of them, right here. Now, I’ve read your essays. How`s your
work progressing?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: My boy, what is it? I upset you in some
way. Was it the sofa? It’s only a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m very happy. You are very kind. I’m no
one and you are… you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You rest for a moment and I’ll fetch you a
glass of tea. Rest, because there’s work for both of us together.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: These people have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: It really is the most extraordinary
thing.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It’s not for lack of land that the muzhiks
live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’m not suggesting they be given land.
Private property is the root of the problem… We should be giving ours
away.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: Give it to whom?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It’s all ridiculous. You think that poverty
makes the peasants somehow morally superior.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes
I do.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It’s a keystone of the movement.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Oh, I know all about the movement.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: If the peasants had money, they wouldn’t
surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a
month.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: No, they’d spend it on drink and whores.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty
years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on
them hand and foot?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Oh, that’s good…that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I think…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Stop scribbling! You all think he’s Christ,
don’t you? He thinks he’s Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: I’m not…I don’t believe Leo Nikolayevich is
Christ. Christ is Christ but…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: I believe he’s one of the prophets. God
speaks through him. I recognize the cadence in his voice.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely.
I’m surrounded by morrons.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Mama, you’re being ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of
love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here
is fully prepared to give away everything we have.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You keep going on like that…Why do you
think we should profit from the work I�m doing which is only meant for
the sake of the people.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate.
It’s quite remarkable, really.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It’s your voice. It’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It’s tiresome. Another remarkable invention
will supercede it.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Please excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite,
I fear.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Oh, that�s better. That�s nice. Very nice
indeed.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Do your parents often speak to each other
so…bluntly?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: My mother doesn’t understand my father’s
goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary. His commitment
to the spiritual life offends her. They’ve fought about it for
years.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m sure she means well.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Your father is the greatest writer in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I mean to say, I feel privileged to be
here. It’s an… honor.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: God Bless You.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m sorry. Sometimes I sneeze when I’m
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: It�s a note, for him.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Well, give it to him then.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It�s from your mother. She wants to see
me.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She is looking for allies. Pay attention.
This is war.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes.
Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Thank you, Countess…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don’t stand on
formality here, as you may have observed. Many young men ruin their
looks by loose living. You’re a real Tolstoyan, I can tell!</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I admire your husband immensely.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: That’s excellent. He likes that.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: His ideas are beautiful…social justice…the
idea…Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: He’s very grateful for the help you’ve been
giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young
man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the
Caucasus.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy,
so I could read all the details…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’ve read War and Peace?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Many times… twice.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: When he was writing it, long before Chertkov
created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this “new religion”
and revolutionary nonsense… What do you think of Chertkov, by the
way?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He’s given me an extraordinary
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving
puritanical idiot. I have to say, it’s been extremely pleasant since
they’ve locked him in his house.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: When my husband was writing it, in the
mid-sixties, he’d bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one
who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too.
Afternoons, we’d drink tea and discuss changes. “Natasha wouldn’t say
that to Prince Andrey,” or “Pierre’s too simple here. He’s not
stupid.”</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But I don’t count anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want
only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the
situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while
they steal my children’s inheritance. Do you know I was the only person.
I could understand his intention.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don’t believe anyone wants to do
that.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I have a little gift for you</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It’s a diary. Everyone should always keep a
diary.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It’s a very popular activity around your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’re teasing me, but I trust you’ll write
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: That may not be so easy.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Nonsense. You’ve been listening to your
friends at Telyatinki… Write what you see. That’s always the place to
begin. What. You. See.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: More tea?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You’re finished for the day?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He didn’t need me this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of women
doing physical labor. Don’t you find that reactionary?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: No, I find it sweet. I find you
reactionary.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: He admires you, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Sergeyenko told me. He’s miserable about
it.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Tolstoy’s kind to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: What do you talk about when you’re with him?
Why are you blushing?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: We talk about me.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He wants to know everything about me, my
parents, my relations with women, my experience of god -</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: And what relations are these?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I had a lover before I came here… headmaster
of a school where I taught. He was married - happily married. It was
difficult. We could make love only at school.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: At school?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: In the gymnasium, after the girls had gone.
There were straw mats on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Have I upset you?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: No…I appreciate your frankness</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: But you disapprove of me. I see it in your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don’t. Not at all…I think sexual
activity…how men and women combine their physical parts is completely
neutral.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Listen to you. You’re a prig. Just like
Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: That’s not fair</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I don’t care if it’s fair. It’s
true…neutral…my God…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Do as you like.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Valentin Fedorovich.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You forgot your horse.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Yes. You know, I think that I… never
mind.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Where’s papa?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I couldn’t write. I was distracted I
think…I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the
war.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: A girl who died?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: No, no…A girl I had sexual intercourse
with… Sometimes we did it twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: God bless…I’ve never forgotten our time
together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: You shouldn’t torture yourself. It was a
long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Torture? You are a virgin, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I try to…you know, to…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: To be what, a good Tolstoyan?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You see, I myself am not a very good
Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything…
Torture…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Kalya, her name was…She’s an old woman now,
white hair, old body like me. She’d hardly remember my name, I suspect.
She may even be dead. Do you think that meant something?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I mean that little romance. Was there some
meaning to it?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It�s interesting. I think you would say..I
mean, I�ve read where you say that the physical body isn�t real. That
it�s all an illusion.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I say lots of things. What do you say? What
do you think?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I…I don�t know.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I don�t know, either.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Smell that…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Lilac?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Precisely. It’s lilac. The smell’s stronger
when the sun goes down.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Papa!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’ve enjoyed myself, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He’s free. He’s free…He’s coming back</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: My dear, dear man.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: He’ll try again to convince your father to
change his will.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: To give the copyright as “a gift to
humanity.”…the reptile.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: Papa’s not in his right mind. He can’t
defend himself against these thieves. My tooth is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’re a fine son, darling. None of this make
believe chastity and made up religion. I wish all my children had turned
out like you.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: A man’th responthibility ith to hith
family.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Chertkov’s notions of virtuous behavior are
calculated to destroy me.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: To dethtroy uth all.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: There is nothing more pathetic than
impoverished aristocrats.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Sofya Andreyevna, I’m happy to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: And I’m happy to make you happy…always.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I’m glad to have a moment alone with you,
Valentin. How do you think you’re getting on?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I hope my work is pleasing to Leo
Nikolayevich.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Yes. He seems satisfied and that’s good.
The reports I’ve received from you however… There seems to be some
confusion.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You send me never ending commentary on
Tolstoy’s writing. That’s all very interesting but not very useful. I
need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna. You must see by now
she’s committed to undermining her husband’s best intentions.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It’s not quite so obvious to me.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Because she is duplicitous. You are very
bright. Too bright to let her into you.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You value our work?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: The ideals we share?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: That’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Good, of course it is. Do you think the
Countess suspects something?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Well, I think the Countess is very
suspicios by nature.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don�t think she likes you very much.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What does she say?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It�s a tone I�ve picked up.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: We simply want to distribute Tolstoy’s
work to the widest audience possible. She just has no understanding what
it is we are trying to do. There�s nothing in it for any of us but a
real chance to increase the world�s happiness.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I can only be of limited help to the
master if I don’t know what’s going on. Any effort she makes to shore up
control of the copyright, I must know. The survival of our movement
depends on it. Remember who your friends are. What you’ve come here to
do.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Hello… Hello?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Ssshh.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Move the book.</p>
<p><strong>valenitn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Your book.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Is it alright?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What…what is it?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You really are a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m playing. It’s fine. It’s wonderful… Hold
me.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Wake up, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I am awake.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I want to ask you something..Say it
again.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: It was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Why did you come to a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: You don�t follow any of the rules.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You mean, why does someone who doesn’t follow
the rules come to a place like this?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: ..it’s not about rules. Not for Tolstoy
anyway…</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Valentin Fedorovich.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: At the moment, I’m indisposed.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Yes, well…Leo Nikolayevich is here. He
want s to see you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Tell him… I’ll be down at once.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Yes..and tell Maria Filipovna we could
use another hand in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: If I see her I will…</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: If you see her…yes. And if you’re going
to behave like rabbits, you should go live in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Let me go out first…give me five
minutes…</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Look at the love in him, like
Jesus..suffering the children…all that…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: An old man is a very ugly thing.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: My dear boy. Come and kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Now, who is this? Maria Filipovna.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You’re both looking so well. Life here at
Telyatinki obviously agrees with you.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: God bless you, boy. What are you nervous
about, now? Sit down. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you’re the
great treasure of Telyatinki. He claims you’re a very gifted
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: We’re happy to have you with us.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’ve killed a living thing.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Do you have something to say?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: It’s absurd. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m sorry but- It’s a mosquito.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Forgive him. He can’t help it. He’s a
better Tolstoyan than I am.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: It’s not the message we want to send.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: From my mother “Nerves dreadful. Stop.
Insomnia. Stop. Pulse 100. Stop. Please come home.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Don’t give in to her, Papa. It’ll never end…I
swear to God, that woman has an instinct for knowing when you’re just
about to enjoy yourself</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: From Sofya Andreyevna. “I beg you. Stop.
Unwell. Stop. Hurry back.”</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Who taught her to use that damned
machine?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Perhaps Sasha’s right. Encouraging this
may not be the best thing.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: It’s a trick, Papa. She’ll drain you. You’ll
be miserable.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Then, let me go with you.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: No, my dear, I’ll go alone.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sofya.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sofya, are you ill?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I’m fine…now that you’re home.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It’s no good, you know, all this. You
frightened everyone.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Did I really? I don’t believe it. Not you.
I’m your little bird. You know the sounds I make.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: That was some sort of love call?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It brought you back to me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Come out of the dark… where I can see
you.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We live in the
country and you insist on making it an opera house. What’s wrong with a
little peace now and then?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Look at me. This is who I am. This is what
you married. We’re older, maybe we’re old, but I’m still your little
chicken You’re still my big cock.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Let me make you crow.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Let me make you sing.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>sofia</strong>: I want you to love me.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m not supposed to do this either.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha. You are not supposed to smoke at
Telyatinki.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: You wouldn’t look at me.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It was difficult in front of the
others.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: But it wasn’t difficult in your bed… When it
was only you and me in front of God.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m not sure I was conscious of God.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: So, I made you forget God?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Yes, only for a moment. You forgot your rules
and remembered love.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: You make it sound very simple.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: It is simple. What we did is what men and
women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We
touched each other– stayed close together. Something passed between us.
Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m afraid I’ve hurt you, haven�t</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for
me. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Good morning, my darling? Do you mind if I
join you?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Of course, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It’s quite insane, my darling. Everyone is
making fun of you.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Even the muzhiks. I heard them laughing in
the barn.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Laughing about what?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I don’t want to ruin last night.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Laughing about the fact that you’ve developed
a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. Your passion for Chertkov
has become a standing joke.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I have a great affection for Vladimir
Grigorivich. Let them laugh if they find it amusing.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But it’s not amusing, darling. It’s sick.
It’s not normal. You hang on his every word.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: We have a great deal in common.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You have nothing in common. You are a genius.
He’s a sycophant and a pervert.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Because he understands what I’m trying to
do? Because he tries to help me accomplish it?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: He is using you. You just can’t seem to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: This is absolute nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: That bold, obese, idiotic man. You treat
him…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It’s impossible for you not to distract me.
Let me alone… for God’s sake. You’re like a spoiled child.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Do you love me, Lyovochka?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Of course, I do.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Then why would you betray me?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Because of the will?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: The new will.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: There’s no new will.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: There is no new will.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Does Chertkov have it?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: There’s no new will.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But that’s why he’s come back. You talk about
it, you and your boyfriend. You plan for it. You have no heart for the
people who really love you. You’d rather be seduced by charlatans and
deluded by flatterers, all in the name of love….You can’t even love your
own children. You can’t even love me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Tell me where it is?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: There is no new will.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Then, promise me there never will be.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I�ve told you the truth. Now, let me work.
Please, will you?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Tomorrow, I’ll go to the Station and lie down
on the track. Tolstoy’s wife becomes Anna Karenina herself! See how the
papers will like that!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: This is unbearable. You don’t want a
husband. You want a Greek chorus.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: She’s here to question you about the new
will.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: How does she know it even exists?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: She claims Leo Nikolayevich told her she
could examine the draft.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: He is obviously not thinking clearly. And
now we have to put up with her petty grasping.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It doesn’t seem petty to me.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He`s her life. The work, in her mind, is
theirs…together.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: And you’re her advocate? You’ve been taken
in by her celebrity. I worried about this.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m talking about their history – - simply
that.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: We should see her. Act as if nothing has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Nothing has happened.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Sofya Andreyevna, at last, you honour us
with your visit.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: And I’m happy to make you happy…always.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Your moustache is…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: It’s a problem of the wax.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Let me get to the point. Vladimir
Grigorivich, I don’t wish to be your enemy. I’m delighted that my
husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals. All I want
is what’s reasonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will. If you
agree, I’m sure we can be friends.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’re very kind. Sofya Andreyevna. But I
can’t help you. Not without specific instructions from your husband.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Leo Nikolayevich has agreed, hasn’t he
Val-</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: No witness you produce will change my
position. But I’ll certainly talk to Leo Nikolayevich at the first
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I want us to be friends, too, Sofya. Leo
Nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world, for both of us. We
should endeavor to set things right between us. Give him peace. Let him
work.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Yes. Valentin Fedorovich…are you coming back
to the house with me?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’ll escort the Countess home and be back
in time for supper.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Masha will be overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Have you been keeping something from me? How
delightful.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: We’ve become close friends, I think. Tell me
everything, dear boy. I love a romance.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It’s nothing, really.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: A young woman in your life is nothing?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha is a friend.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: A lover?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: A good friend.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: That sounds serious enough.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I don’t mean to annoy you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m not annoyed.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You forget that I’m an experienced reader. I
can read your face, every letter. It’s beautifully clear. Do you love
her?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Not something they’d understand, these so
called disciples of my husband. They’ve never understood a word he’s
written. What do any of them know about love?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Sorry, sorry, I’ll… I didn’t mean to scare
you…Are you alright.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Fine…fine…Why did you…?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I came back as soon as I could. It was a
strange day. Leo Nikolayevich,…I love to listen to him. I love nothing
more…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: But today I could hardly concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: All I could think of was you.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I think I’ve confused you. I’ve confused us
both.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: No. No. You didn�t confuse me..I was
stupid. I was afraid, but I’m not afraid anymore.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I love you, Masha!</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Maybe you could help me a little.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Before the other night…I’d committed the
act of copulation many times in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I think about you all the time. In my
heart I�ve comitted the act of copulation many times. I just want to
say…It was never like it was with you.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’ll wait for you, then.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Ivan, who’s wearing that awful perfume?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I hate to say it but the Countess has
become more and more dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Not dangerous… She’s concerned for the
welfare of the family.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: And we’re concerned for the welfare of
mankind. Take this down.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It�s a terrible thing you ask. I can�t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’ve been more than reasonable. She
already controls the income from your property.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Listen to him, papa. He has our best
interests at heart.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: We’re speaking only of the rights to your
words, your ideas.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: She’s my wife. She�s part of me. We’ve been
together now, so many years….</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: But you’re more than a husband and father.
She must understand that. The best interests of the people are one with
your own. You belong to them.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: But she won’t. She’ll never understand.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: She’s unstable…I wonder if she isn’t
ill.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: It�s sadly more than possible.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I know it�s hard for you, papa. But we must
be realistic.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Do you really think she’s fit to control
the final disposition of the will?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: How dare you?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’re all plotting against me. In my own
house, too. I bear you thirteen children. How can you betray me like
this? Someone help me up.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Give everything you’ve got to him, your fat
little catamite. “What will it be, my dearest dear, my Vladimir
Grigorivich? My wife’s heart on a platter? Her kidneys? With salt? But
of course, my dear Chertkov, whatever pleases you. The china. The
estate. Permanent copyright on everything I’ve ever written? Anything
for you, my love.”</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Give me that. Give it to me, you little
weasel.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Please, Countess Sofya-</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Mama, please…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Can I not…Can I not have…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You’ll kill him, Mama. That’s what you want,
isn’t it? You want him to die!”</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You! Don’t think you deceive me for one
little moment! I know exactly what you’re doing. I want to see the will.
It’s my right, in the name of god.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You. I’m afraid of you.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: The press is bloodthirsty. Had I wished, I
could’ve demolished you and your family. You make it easy.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin
us.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I have too much respect for Leo
Nikolayevich. You’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Why can’t my husband see you for what you
are?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: If I had a wife like you, I would have
blown my brains out long ago. Or gone to America.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I hope you’re feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Do you like the opera?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I took singing lessons for years. I
thought about a career in music. The only thing I lacked, in the end,
was talent. I’m sorry about everything.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a
woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her…Everyone is very moved
by that…in the opera.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Our life together has become
intolerable.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Sit down, Valentin.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Really, I’m expected at Telyatinki.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We’ve had a
disagreement. No more than any other married couple.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I didn’t come for more recrimination.
Despite good cause for alienation between us, I have never stopped
loving you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Of course…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: God knows you don’t make it easy.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Why should it be easy? I’m the work of your
life. You’re the work of mine. Its what love is.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Everything with him is hysterics</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sit down. So, this is what love is. Does
that surprise you, boy?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I thought it might be quieter, but-</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy/sofya</strong>: God bless you</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: He’s right, though. If we cannot live a
decent, quiet life, if I cannot work, if I cannot find some peace, I
shall simply go away.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Go? Where?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Dushan says you’re killing me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I hate you. I hate what you’ve become.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Countess…Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’ll destroy me.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Sofya! Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: My back. My back… I’m hurting.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: You’re lying on a fork. Sit up and you’ll
improve markedly…Valentin, help to get her upstairs, would you?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: She’s alright. I’m more concerned for you…
We should all go to bed before something else happens.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It was terrible there today… between them.
They loved each other so much, but you see what it becomes.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Masha, what�s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m going back to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon. He
says I could be more useful there…which means…</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: This is him punishing us, punishing me for
befriending Sofya Andreyevna. For not… This is Chertkov.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: We’ve both disappointed him.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don’t care. You can’t go away. I’ll talk
to him. I’ll make him change his mind. i�m going to make you stay.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: No, I want to go.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m leaving the movement.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: You can�t leave Tolstoy.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I am not. Look, when I read his Confession,
it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger.
Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense
of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that’s what it would be
about. Isn’t that what it’s about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all
up.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: Come with me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I’m going to my room.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Don’t leave me, Masha… I need you.</p>
<p><strong>masha</strong>: I know you do…I know.</p>
<p><strong>rossolimo</strong>: I believe the Countess suffers from a
mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Why did you bring him here?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: He’s an old friend, you know, from Rome.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: And astoundingly stupid in the way of all
scientists.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’m sorry, my friend, but this is all very
upsetting to me.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Take them downstairs. Thank them for me.
Offer them a drink.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: You’ll be alright?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me,
won’t you, boy</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Ya…your…your…I can�t remember now…Yo, what
did I say? What did you mean?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You rest now.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You see, I no longer feel I have a choice
in the matter. She isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: This will insure that the complete works
will live in the public domain.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: Monumentous.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Your work is the birthright of the Russian
people. Now, they possess it forever.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I need a pen.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: I…uh…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’re a secretary. How can you not have a
pen?</p>
<p><strong>sergeyenko</strong>: He’s a secretary, too. Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Valentin Fedorovich, do you have a
pen?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I feel like a conspirator.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Maybe we should get back. It’ll be dark
soon. May I ask you something that has nothing to do with work?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Of course, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Do you love your wife?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: ” Your youth and your desire for happiness
reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me.”
When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed
impossible that I’d ever have her. I didn’t want to tell her how I felt
and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of
letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely
confused, thinking it was a game or…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I gave her one clue. The first two Y’s, I
said, stand for “your youth” and then the most miraculous thing
happened. She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: …as if she had read my mind. In that
moment, we both knew we would always be together. For those first years,
we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: And now this.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for
your forethought.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m a secretary, after all.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You know I had thought for a time to
suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else. But…he said no. He
said “He reminds me of myself when I was young.”</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m leaving Telyatinki.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I am going to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: She is leading you around the nose.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Look, you say the movement’s about
love-</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Yes… The love he tells us to practice, the
love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love.
Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: But I’ve never met mankind, only men and
women, imperfect men, imperfect women.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can
not be weakminded. Go. You won’t be missed …a naive sentimentalist</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Why are you laughing? You think I’m
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m laughing because I didn’t sneeze.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the
rights to your work after your death.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Then I shall try and die as soon as is
convenient.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Don’t be silly. They’ve offered one million
rubles.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: How can you not be pleased?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I don’t write for publishers. I write for
people.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Valentin’s in the library. He’s asked to
speak to me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Splendid…while your wretched family is left
to starve.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I don’t see anyone starving in this house.
On the contrary, our privilege revolts me.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But you’re always first to the trough…always
have been.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: What is it, dear boy? You look unhappy.
What do you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sofya, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: How could you do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You’re not well.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You hurt me again and again. You take little
pieces of me until I become nothing. I don’t know who I am anymore. I
read your diary. I know what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: You behave like this, I have no choice. Now
give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: No! Give me the gun!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Give it to me, please.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I’d like you to stay here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Valentin. Valentin.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Get up. He’s leaving.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He�s leaving.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Essentials only. Nothing that isn’t
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Please…we must hurry.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Where will you go?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Absolutely essential.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: A lantern, I think. It’s very dark tonight.
And the apparatus for giving an enema.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Everything’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Papa…?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: He’s changed his mind. He’s going back to
the house.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Do you want to go back?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: When I was a boy, my brother Nikolai once
brought me to a place when I was a boy. He told me he’d found a green
stick with some words on it… the secret to happiness for all men
everywhere. He hid it in the ground. I looked for it very often. I’ve
looked for it all these years. I really believed I would find it
here…but I never did.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I never did…but this life is behind me
now.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Help me up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Give this to Sofya.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Be well. Be well.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Don’t cry. I’ll send for you when I
can.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I’m simply telling you what happened. He’s
gone. I have no idea where. Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’re a liar. Liar!</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: So, he’s gone. For good.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I think so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>sofy</strong>: Darling Sasha, where is your father? I know
you know. Please, please. Don’t play games with me. Now it�s not the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Honestly, I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I have this for you.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: The pond!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Mama, Mama! Stop. Not this. Hurry! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Countess!</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: My position in the house has become
intolerable. What I’m doing now is what people have commonly done -
leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and
solitude.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I beg you to forgive me for everything I’ve
done to you, just as I forgive you with all my soul for everything
you’ve done to me.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Sasha, go back to the jetty. Here, let me
help you.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: No! She’s drowning. Help her!</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I will. I will. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She’s dead. My mother. She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Let me take you to the house, mother.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Let me die. Please. Why would you rob me of
that?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Let’s go to the house.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Ivan, go to the station. Find out which train
the master took.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I see no harm in it. Let’s get her to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Life returns to torture her for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She’s exhausted herself. She’s slept for
nearly four hours.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m glad she can sleep. The pain subsides
a little.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: The noise subsides a little.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Well, a little.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: A message, miss.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: No, for your father. From the Countess,
miss.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She’s allowed to send a note to my father. I
just don’t know where to tell her to send it.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: She’s addressed it to train number 9. That’s
the train the master took. The station master told me…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Why are you giving it to me? She is allowed
to send my father a note!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She never gives up. “Dearest papa. Return at
once.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Ingenious.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Obvious.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: He gave me this as well…the stationmaster. A
note for you.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He’s with my aunt. At the Shamardino.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: They’ve all gone</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You’re writing to your girl. That’s
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don’t know if she’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But you believe you’ll see her again.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I very much hope so.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Yes. Refuse to believe in the end of love. Do
all you can to prevent it…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I know you know where he is, Valentin.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I won’t ask you to betray his trust…but I
need you to go to him. I do. I have to see him. I have to talk to him. I
won’t make a scene. Promise him that. I must see him.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He’s right, you know, to go. She will be
right behind us.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I�ve told you she has promised she
wouldn�t make any problems. But besides, where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: We don’t need a plan, my dears, we’ll
simply go</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I guess our little secret is out.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: There’s a reporter outside from the Russian
World.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Tell him we’ve received an apologetic letter
from your father..very embarrassed. We expect him back any day…</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: But that’s a lie, right?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Yes, that’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Please move back. Please let him breath.
Please give him some room.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He can�t breath. Valentin, please. The smoke
is too much.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: I know. Stay back.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: It’s alright. Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Let me take your temperature.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Good old Dushan,…you needn’t worry.
Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel. Whatever happens, it’s not
your fault… I’m feeling much better now. I just need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Good, good. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: He will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: We’ve come to the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: The stationmaster says we may have his
house for as long as we need it. There are no inns nearby, so we’re
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Very lucky.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You’ll be comfortable here, papa. The rest of
us…we’ll find cots or sleep in the station.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: And then we’ll be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Hello, hello? Could you send a cable for
me?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Tolstoy ill at Astapovo. Temperature high.
Send it to Sofya Andreyevna, Yasnaya Polyana.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: We must leave at once.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: We’ll make inquiries in the morning,
mother.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: We’ll rent a train.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: That’ll cost a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Don’t say irrelevant things, Andrey. It’s
unbecoming. Contact someone. I’ll go and pack.</p>
<p><strong>andrey</strong>: Rent a train? God!</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Bulgakov! Where is he? Take me to him.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: He left…astonishing…He actually, finally
left.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He wasn’t well enough to travel. It’s very
cold.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: It’s a triumph for the movement.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: He looks so small.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Papa.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: It’syou.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: My dear friend, waht is all of this?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I needed to see you. Thank you. We have so
much to do. I�m sorry. Damn hic ups. Have you seen Sofya?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I’ve made a point not to.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: I don’t know when she’ll come. But she’ll
come . I know it.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: And we’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Ready for what?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: I’m sorry, but it’s time for your enema.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Don’t apologize, my friend. Your enemashave
become the news of the world. Now, all of you, help turn me over.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I’d like to send another cable.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: At Astapovo. Stop. Tolstoy Ill. Stop.
Heart breaking. Stop. Please Come…. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: It goes to Masha…to Maria Filipovna
Melinov, Moscow. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>orthodox priest</strong>: If the Count should have a change
of heart…if in the last moment he chooses to confess, mother church is
there to embrace him with open arms.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I’ll see what I can do, father.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She’s coming this way.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Not before she stops to tell them lies,
catalogue my atrocities.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Let me speak to her.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I want to see my husband.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Yes I’ll…uhm…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I want to see him. Now!</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Countess!</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Valentin…Will you help me? I have to see him.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Of course. But I’m not certain if it�s the
best time, Countess.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It is. It’s the right time for me.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Sofya Andreyevna… Stay back, stay
back.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I want to see my husband.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He’s too weak now, mother.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: But he’s not too weak to see you. Not too
weak to see that…</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Do you really want to do this here?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I am the leper outside the gate, while he
sleeps with the devil himself.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Vladimir Gregorovich is here because father
asked him to be here.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Have you told him I nearly drowned in the
pond?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: We didn’t have to. It was in all the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Let me take you back.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: That if you killed yourself, he’d be
upset.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: He’d be upset?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Horribly upset…but he could not have acted
other than he did.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I want to see him. He’s not your husband.
He’s my husband.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You’re unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: And you are a stone-hearted bitch of a
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I lost five children. Why couldn’t one of
them have been you?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Valentin, will you take me back?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I’ve behaved badly, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: No, Countess, Don’t worry. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: What is it? Dushan, what�s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Listen to him. I’m supposed to be a doctor,
for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sofya!</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: What is it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: She’s come, hasn’t she? She`s here.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’re imagining things.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: It’s true, Leo Nikolayevich.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sasha…where’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: She’s at home.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: If she wanted to see me I couldn’t refuse
her. Is she going to come here?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I don’t think so…I don’t know, Papa. There’s
no way to…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: She’s at home. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: At home.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Yes, Papa.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Very beautiful isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Our home?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: He said to me once…“you’re like your mother.
You’re so full of anger.”</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I know it’s terrible…but who will protect
him? I don’t want him to die.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Kind thoughts from George Bernard
Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: You lied to him.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: He wants to see her. You heard him say
it.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What exactly do you think she will bring
him?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: I don�t know, they�ve been married for 48
years.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I�ll tell you what she�ll bring…Vanity,
fuss and noise.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: She promised me-</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: What? Promised you what? You�ve seen her
at close quarters, boy. You think she�s capable of restraining
herself?</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: They have a whole life togehter. Why do
you have to deny that?</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: You’re a victim of her romantic nonsense.
You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do. She travels
with that unctious little priest.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Keep the priest away-</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: These people are vultures. They send in at
the last moment and welcome him back to the church. That’s their
fantasy. A death bed recantation. Do you have any idea the damage it
would do? Everything he’s dreamed of, everything we’ve worked for will
be gone. A simple noble death is what we want. It is what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: No, you want an icon. You want to take
photographs and give out postcards..You want people to kneel in front of
an image you�ve created. But he doesn�t wanted that. He never wanted
that, and it will give him no peace. He wants to see her…let her
come.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I will do everything in my power to
prevent that.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Oh, God. You exhaust me.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I used to think you were just naive,
Valentin, maybe a little stupid. I see now you’re more dangerous than
she is.</p>
<p><strong>valentin</strong>: Tell me one thing. That image you want to
create, just looks like you, doesn�t it?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: It can’t be right. His fever is down.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: His pulse, you see…</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sofya…my dear Sofya. So much has fallen to
her.</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Who’s going to look after her? Someone
needs to look after her.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Shall I call her?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: This is it. The end.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Do you want to see her, papa?</p>
<p><strong>tolstoy</strong>: Sasha, Sasha.. It’snothing…Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: It’s almost over.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: He won�t know who she is anyway.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Has he asked for me?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I want you to come. Take a coat. It’s
cold.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Countess…Countess…Do you have any
information? Countess…Is he dying? Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Lyovochka!</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Please forgive me, my darling!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Mother…</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: I’m a fool.. I’m a selfish woman. But I love
you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all
my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Control yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Was I shouting?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You have to control yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: You don’t speak, but I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: “Do you love me, Lyovochka.” “Never stopped,
my little bird.” “And you will never stop” “Never.” “Nor ever leave me
again.” “Never, ever again.”Good…good… let’s go home”</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: First cessation.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Second cessation.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Please forgive me if I cry a little now.</p>
<p><strong>chertkov</strong>: I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: It’s alright. What happens from now on… it
will never really matter. Not really. Everything’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>sofya</strong>: Dushan, could you tell them your great friend
is gone?</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dushan</strong>: At ten minutes after six in the morning, a
great soul passed from our world. Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy is dead.</p>
