<h1 id="two-for-the-money">two-for-the-money</h1>
<p><strong>brandon lang’s voice</strong>: That’s me. Five years old. I
remember that day. Believe it or not, I remember that hit. I remember it
because of the smile that spread over my dad’s face…</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: I would’ve stood there all day to
sink one. Just to see that smile…</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: To pop, sports were a religion.
To me, it was about purity, a place where all wrongs could be made
right, or at least temporarily forgotten. I was going to fill the whole
house with trophies for him. There was no doubt in my mind, I was going
to make him happy…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Last play. Slant red, right back on two. On
two, Scottie. It’s a lock. A guaranteed TD. I’ve already seen it. So
relax. There’s nothing to worry about ’cept one thing – after we win and
they’re shoving cameras in your faces, I don’t want to hear any “Hi
moms.” Guys, it’s overdone, the fans are tired of it and if you have to
thank some one you can just thank me. See you in the end zone.</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: I’d been a quarterback since
pee-wee football. Set high school records. Won state championships. I
wasn’t driven by joy, it wasn’t winning as much as terror, pure and
simple – fear of losing.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcers</strong>: South West Nevada needs a score.
Seven seconds on the clock. 22 yard line. Win or lose, this has been a
spectacular season for Lang. The big question, should he turn pro now or
wait until – Lang’s got the snap–</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: … My first thought was I can tape
it and play next week. Then I puked.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s the rehab time?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: When do I play again?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The patient’s got a question!</p>
<p><strong>surgeon voiceover</strong>: Football’s done, son…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Brandon… Brandon, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: You okay? I saw what happened on the
tv. Helluva thing that happening like that.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: I brought some flowers. From
downstairs in the shop.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: I’m thinking of getting into a new
program, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Could you get him out, please?</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: It’s okay, we’re fine, I’m his
father.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Just get out!</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: It doesn’t rain much in the
desert. Maybe it was that, or maybe the look on my mother’s face, or how
fast coach left after getting me up the steps, but I swore then and
there – no matter what, I’d get back – I would play again…</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: Doc told me it would take years
to heal. One bad hit and it’d be over. But the team needed me and I had
to play to get drafted. I figured I’d take a chance…</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: Every minute of recovery I’d
dreamt about this moment. There were NFL scouts in the stands. I knew
what happened next.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Let’s ease back into it with our bread</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: …It was over. I could’ve gone out
with class, a gritty smile and a little wave to the crowd from a
stretcher, instead I opted to go psycho on national tv.</p>
<p><strong>jim rome</strong>: Welcome to the jungle! Hey clones, do you
believe this idiot?! That cannot happen! This is college football, not
the ultimate fighting championship! What we have here is too much muscle
and not enough brain mass – this is why we need a life-time ban! Make an
example out of him! Because the sport deserves better than this! Talk to
me!</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: It made all the highlight films.
People wrote editorials. Overnight I became the poster boy for the “Dark
Side of Sports.”</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Who did the referee represent,
Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He represented the nearest guy I could
grab.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: … Let’s try again.</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: Football wasn’t a sport, it was
my life. Maybe I couldn’t play anymore but I couldn’t leave. So I went
with it,</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –You’ve reached the Jessica Simpson hot
line! Jessica’s going to tell you all about Nick’s surprise birthday
party and her rockin’ new panty line at Wal-Mart, but first, here’s a
little fan trivia to win a VIP Gold Package back stage pass to Jessica’s
Omnicon Hotels Summer Tour–</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Got a job for you, Lang.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m in the middle of taping.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Bauer’s sick, can’t update his betting line.
You know anything ’bout sports?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Yeah, a little.</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: 900 numbers, audio text, the
racket had a lot of names.</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: This guy’s gig was sports
handicapping. Predicting winners for people who bet. I was supposed to
just record his picks.</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: My picks went 9-and-1 that
weekend. By football season, the job was mine…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –Kansas City is 7-1 against the point
spread versus division opponents coming off a Monday night game. Take
K.C. minus the six points. Call tomorrow for my pro football game of the
year – Tampa Bay versus Oakland. That’s 900-656-3100. This is Brandon
Lang saying good night and good luck everybody.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I went 9-2 in pro football Sunday and hit
my third straight Monday night parlay.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: That’s what you get paid for.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I want a raise to 12 bucks an hour.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: I don’t make 12 an hour.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re not picking 75 percent.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: If you’re so good then bet your own games, get
rich and send me a postcard</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hey Stu, where’s the action this
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor/stu</strong>: We’re getting big money on
Tampa/Oakland. Everyone’s jumping on Tampa Bay.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That game’s gonna be won by coaching, Stu.
Gruden put that Tampa Bay team together before he came to Oakland,
right? He knows every weakness of that team and every strength. He knows
Brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he’ll have him
double-teamed to the right. He knows Gannon always throws on a 3-step
drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field.
Gannon’ll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Thanks, B.</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: I scrounged some old headers, B! Check it
out!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Awesome dude. That’s a righteous ride,
Denny.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m late. Dinner’s in the oven.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Thank God. A man won 5600 at my table last
night. Tipped me out in color. I gave it to Denny, help him with
college.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Mail came, letter for you, from Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: At least they kicked me a cap.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>man voiceover</strong>: Congratulations! You went 9-2 last
Sunday! 20-4 college! Picking 77 percent winners since opening weekend!
I’ve been following you! I’m a big fan, Brandon! A big fan.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How’d you get this number? If you want
picks, call my 900 line.</p>
<p><strong>man voiceover</strong>: What I want, Brandon, is for you to
come to New York and work for me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>man voiceover</strong>: This is Walter Abrams. I don’t know
if you know me but I run the biggest sports service in the country.
Hell, I started the industry. Ask around. Ask anyone,</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Do me a favor and lose my number, I gotta
go to work.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>walter vo</strong>: It’s me again.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is a joke, right?</p>
<p><strong>walter vo</strong>: A joke can be the ultimate intellectual
pursuit sometimes. This? This is just a job offer. In your top drawer
there’s an envelope with your name on it.</p>
<p><strong>walter vo</strong>: That’s travel cash and an airline ticket.
It’s not a magic trick, Brandon. I paid someone to put it there, who
incidentally</p>
<p><strong>walter vo</strong>: Run the numbers, do the math. Hold on a
sec–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m gonna pay. I’ll pay you–</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: –Pay me? Pay Walter. His car. I’m Milton, I
drive for him.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I thought it was a service.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Oh yeah, going on two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll hire the trainers too… Well run it by
them, you won’t know until you try… So, they can stay the night. I’ll
put ’em up at the Plaza, nice suite, park view… Okay double it… Triple
it… Everything’s about money. Look, on Sunday, my daughter, an angel,
turns six, it’s not likely to happen again. She</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Whoa, look at you. The Marlboro man.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ve been in better.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you can sell you’ll never starve. Ever
speak in public? Perform? Anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I played quarterback in college. Division
one.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know, I’m talking about not in
uniform.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I used to sing at church.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh really? So you’re religious?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Certain things, you either are or you
aren’t. Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a
pastor… obviously not now. I mean, yeah, I believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Relax. What do I care? Besides, it’s against
the law to hire based on religious orientation. You’re not a republican
are you? Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That was six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: C’mon, you won three conference titles at a
major university. You think I went to college? I’m autodidactic. Big
word, huh? Know what it means? Self-taught. Partially by reading, sure,
but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking
questions. I swear to God I’m looking at myself 30 years ago. A taller,
more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance is remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not supposed to smoke any more, among
other things. It’s bad for my condition. So before I die, did you do
anything other than the sports phone in Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Just the 900 number recordings, it was full
time, I mean we got 10 bucks a call.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Chump change, Brandon. We’re angling for
bigger fish here. You see, the networks don’t talk about it and Uncle
Sam can’t tax it, but sports gambling is a
200-billion-dollar-a-year-business. These gamblers have needs, Brandon.
Come Monday morning, after a losing weekend, a lot of them have big
needs.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s every pro game played last
Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>tv walter</strong>: Hello – this is Walter Abrams and welcome
to The Sports Advisors and week three in professional football. After a
nice five day vacation on my yacht I can’t be any more ready than I am
right now. Studying the mismatches this weekend I can only conclude
they’re giving my handicappers a license to steal. I want you to take
out a blank</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How’d you afford that yacht if the picks
are free?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There is no yacht. Good, keep asking
question. Next.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You didn’t answer about the free picks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know. What else?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s on the second floor?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s where we print the money. Any
more?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, that clears up pretty much
everything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Great. Welcome aboard. We got some good
stuff to work with.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ever have a manicure?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Me? No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because you need one. Besides, there’s a
girl you gotta meet.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Really? What’s she like?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Beautiful, you’ll like her–</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I see a beautiful woman. What are you –all of
35? I have a girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to “tighten it up a
bit” and came out with a permanent smile. Even when she cries she looks
like she’s laughing. Another, she’s on her third eye lift. Her skin’s so
tight, I swear, if you put an egg shell on her butt she’d look like a
baby bird.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m just thinking of a tune-up.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Oh yeah, first it’s a tune-up, then it’s
something else, and one day you’ll come teetering in with your new 36Cs
and a stretched face and you won’t be able to say how unhappy you are
because of all the collagen they shot in your lips.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Easy for you to say. You used to model.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Oh yeah, that’s true. Those were the good
days. Sometimes I like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of
retouched photos and reminisce about rehab.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tightly wound today, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I guess. Must be the coffee talking.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: … Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I’m Toni. Walter said you’d stop by.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He makes all his employees do this?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Every one.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How often?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Once. Before they start work.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Weird.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ve never had my nails done before.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No thanks. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: No, do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Alcohol. Are you a drinker?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ve been pretty focused on staying in
shape. I mean a beer once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Smoke?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Look, I’m sorry, I’m pressed for time.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Really? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Toni, huh? Are you here full-time?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s my shop, I better be. Why don’t you
gamble?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well I’ll tell you, Toni. I bet on
something once. Risked everything I had and lost.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I swore I’d never do it again.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Well Walter could definitely use someone with
a little resolve in his life.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: … He didn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Brandon, Walter and I are married.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What? Walter just said I was meeting a
woman. He acted like…</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Walter’s got a weird sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re kidding me? Coming here… the
manicure… this was an interview?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You’re swift.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Except for an illegal forward pass,</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m starting you on the 900 numbers, same
gig you did in Vegas. You’ll make your picks and record them every day,
once a day Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends. Each
call’s worth 25 bucks a shot. Right now we get a few dozen hits a week.
We should be doing triple that. I’m sending down some test copy. Before
you record it, a little advice.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Your pitch sucks, it doesn’t exist. The
pieces are there, we just gotta bust you out.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: From now on you have a new name – John
Anthony, “The Million Dollar Man.”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hold on. What’s wrong with Brandon
Lang?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Brandon Lang is still at home with his
mother. You’re selling a lifestyle here, and John’s livin’ large. John’s
got a direct line to God and for a measly 25 bucks a call you’re gonna
let the world’s losers listen in.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello sports fans! This is John Anthony in
the Big Apple with my big money picks! The action starts Saturday with
college ball and our first matchup, Michigan against Indiana–</p>
<p><strong>walter vo</strong>: Wrong!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s your sales pitch?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s my sales pitch? 77 percent’s my
sales pitch.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Stats aren’t enough! These are gamblers</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Certainty in an uncertain world!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: John Anthony here, ready to make all your
betting dreams come true! Call now and let me win for you! The point
spread in the Indiana/Michigan game’s up to four, making that game a
gimme–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What is that shit? You spent 6 years
bouncing from one dead-end job to another. Riding to work on a frigging
bicycle. Were you making some kind of statement? What the hell were you
afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I wasn’t afraid of anything. I was working
my ass off, trying to get back in the game.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You are back in the game! Convince me you
belong here!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is John Anthony here, and from Wall
Street to Tokyo to Hollywood, all your big money stays and plays with
me! Winning consistently’s the name of this game and I always remain the
same, winners on a consistent basis, 77 percent winners! So sit back and
relax because</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: Game one of my three-team parlay
is Michigan hosting Indiana; the big boys at Michigan are just 2-7
against the spread as a double-digit home favorite and with arch rival
Wisconsin on deck next week, Indiana will catch them looking ahead! Take
Indiana plus the 16 points! It’s a lock!</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: You want more? John Anthony’s the
man with a plan to make you money! Game two goes to Florida and North
Carolina! I don’t care how many points you gotta lay with Florida, lay
it! They’ll win by 50!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: C’mon! First too little, then too much
–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Tell me what you want.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. What do you want, Brandon? That’s what
this is about!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Walter? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Huh?… It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Should I call someone?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not unless they got a spare heart. I’m
okay.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Courage wants to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s a machine, all he does is work out and
pick winners. Talk about fit. Go take a peek, see him with his shirt
off. I did. He’s a serious side of beef.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Enjoy your daughter’s party.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Check him out, you know you want to.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Get out of your head, Walter. It’s a bad
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ll have the bruketta and the – this, with
the pasta.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s bruchetta. Like little pizzas without
the cheese.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Bruchetta.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Anyone goes 20 for 24
in college football, 12 for 14 pro can call it whatever he wants. Ever
drink a thousand dollar bottle of wine? Steward!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s a waste, Walter. He hardly drinks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a celebration. Just because he’s out
with a couple of reformed drunks doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy
himself.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I was a lot of things, Walter, but I was never
a drunk.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Actually, truth be told, I’ve never had a
12 dollar bottle of water either.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He thinks we’re fighting.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No. I just, this place is great.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: –Watch out, Walter, he’s a fixer.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: 175 calls on the 900 number.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Did you call home? Let ’em know how you did?
How you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I will tomorrow. My mom works nights at the
casino, she’ll sleep till three.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Are you close with your parents?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s very close. They sound terrific.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Is your name Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Oh, they’re great. We talk all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What’re they like?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Mom’s terrific. Amazing lady. I got a
little brother, Denny, going to college next year. Complete motor head.
Dad’s a… well he’s a sports nut. He was, I mean, it all came from
that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Kid grew up with the frigging Cleavers…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I should’ve ordered two.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What’d the doctor say, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh yeah, I’ve been meaning to tell you. I
had a check-up yesterday. Afterwards</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You didn’t touch the sauce.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Neither should you, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I read chocolate’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I’m not raising a kid alone.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t get dramatic, Toni. In biblical times
you’d just move in with my brother Morty.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –Wow. What a meal. Do you feel good,
Brandon? Content?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, I can tell. Don’t be. Ever. One week’s
over, another begins. The past is merely a prologue. In this job you
have to push the envelope every day.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look at that. Beauty and the beasts. What do
you think of her, Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: She’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Cute doesn’t half cover it. The girl’s
gorgeous. And bored out of her mind. Waiting for some young buck to save
her from those two gorillas. Check it out. She’s eyeing you again,
Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: So are the two guys she’s with.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can’t
pick her up, cash, if you leave with her.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Who’s gambling? It’s a challenge. If Brandon
leaves with her I give him ten thousand dollars, that’s probably more
than he made last year. If not, he gives me a grand, which I’ll give to
you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t bet, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: All right. Before you bust a move, just one
thing…</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll send over a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The voice of reason. She’s right. I owe ’em
a meal. Hey – here we go, Brandon, your girlfriend’s going to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well get moving, slick.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey, I just raised the bar. C’mon, kid. John
Anthony could close her.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I’d prefer Brandon…</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I just want to get to know you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You just want to get into my pants.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I want to get into your mind, your heart,
your soul. I don’t see you wearing any pants in this equation.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m Brandon. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Alexandria. Beautiful name for a beautiful
girl.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Everything you’ve ever done’s been leading
up to this moment. Put your ear to the door. Hear that? It’s the sound
of possibilities. The din of greatness.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We use the 800 number and free tips to bait
the hook. Then the bettors are</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is the day’s phone sheet, it’s a list
of everyone who’s called. Only way to keep track of the action. All
leads equal money.</p>
<p><strong>herbie</strong>: Trust me, we’re going to turn all this
around… I’m aware last weekend was difficult… Well of course I do,
that’s a substantial sum–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fuck him if he can’t take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re telling me that all this is
legal?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It better be. Five of these guys are
off-duty cops. We’re just advising people how to bet, not making the
bets for ’em.</p>
<p><strong>reggie/into phone</strong>: –It says here your minimum bet’s
five grand, so let’s be honest now, can you</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Brandon Lang, meet Reggie.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: You’re the QB that went off on the refs.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Hamstring.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, he’s in the middle of renegotiating.
It’s a tantrum, he’ll play Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I had three guys who picked games. I fired
one last weekend. I’m giving you his job. This is your office. From here
out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers. How do you
like it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s not to like?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The Miami/New York point spread shifted a
half tick up to 10.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Miami’s still a lock. The win/loss ratios and
RPI ratings are off the charts. I’m keeping it on my sheet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Jerry’s our top handicapper, came to me
straight out of grad school. Jerry, meet the new kid in town.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whoa, phone guy makes good. Big jump from the
900 numbers. Watch out you don’t get a nose bleed. Just kidding, best of
luck, I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Pleasure meeting you. By the way, Jerry,
New York’s gonna win straight up. They always play the fish tight.
Tonight it’s foregone, they win outright.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really? Listen up, stick to college, sonny.
You have to work up to pro ball around here. Nice try though.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You mean me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not you. John Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: John Anthony doesn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s a shock ’cause I’m standing in his
office and you’re sitting in his chair!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Look, making predictions is one thing – but
pushing people to bet, it’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Pushing people? Get real, this country was
built on gambling. Look at Wall Street – one big casino. The state
spends millions hawking the lottery. If people want to pay for advice on
who to bet, who are we to say no? Stop being selfish, spread the word!
Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You got a whole room full of salesmen.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Big bettors don’t want to talk to a middle
man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks – and you’re picking
80 percent winners.</p>
<p><strong>walter con’d</strong>: What’s the matter? Gonna lose your
purity? C’mon, what do you think selling is? We’re just talking a few
well-timed phrases. Let’s start with an easy one. A throw-away. “I don’t
want your money, I want your bookie’s fucking money?”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t want your money –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –Jesus, don’t start that shit again. Sell
me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t want your money, I want your
bookie’s money!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What happened to the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nothing, I just don’t talk like that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I can’t have someone working for me who
can’t say fuck.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s not that I can’t. Why do I have
to?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because there’s no other fucking word that
can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life’s various
predicaments and certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can. Fuck
is your friend. Fuck can be your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m happy for you and your friend, Walter,
but I’m not using it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Chaucer used it 600 years ago. It was good
enough for him. C’mon–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: C’mon, repeat after me – fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck. Fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me – try it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s not me. Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Backbone. Almost as good. We’ll keep working
on the other thing… So, you really like New York in tonight’s game?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Continue your education.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We’re here for the gambler’s anonymous
meeting…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: …I mean you’d think with two mortgages
out, repo guys staking out my car, my job on the line and my wife
threatening to leave, you’d think I’d have the goddamn brains to stop,
instead of staying in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what
I did… I know I’m sick because I keep thinking if I just pulled that
game out then I got a lock on the parlay and I’m flush going into Monday
night and–</p>
<p><strong>member #1</strong>: … It’s a disease, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>member #2</strong>: Admitting you have a problem is the
first</p>
<p><strong>businessman/leon</strong>: Then I guess I’m doing pretty good
because I got one big fucking problem.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: My name’s Walter. I’m new to the group.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s not?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not even close. You’re a lemon. Like a bad
car, there’s something inherently defective in you. And you. And me! All
of us here – we’re lemons! Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons!
We look like everyone else but we’re defective because when most people
make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate gamblers of the
world, we’re subconsciously playing to lose. All humans like going to
the edge of the abyss, but what makes us different is we go all the way
and hurl ourselves off into the void! And we like doing it so much we do
it time after time after time! Me? I always felt most alive when they
were raking away the chips, and every one here knows what I’m talking
about. People like us, even when we win, it’s just a matter of time
before we give it all back. But when we lose, and I mean the kind of
loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point,
there’s a moment when you’re standing there and you’ve just recreated
the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the 20th
goddamn time and you suddenly realize – hey, I’m still here, I’m still
breathing, I’m still alive! In order to really live you have to be aware
of your own mortality – and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the
best ways</p>
<p><strong>walter con’d</strong>: I know of getting that feeling. When
you win, you defy death, but when you lose,</p>
<p><strong>bicycle messenger</strong>: Hey! You’re the guy I see on tv
every weekend selling betting picks!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Check the charter, buddy, we all left our
jobs at the door. You gonna toss an ex-alcoholic bartender out of an AA
meeting?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … No, I mean, we walked in together –</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What the fuck was that?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … What’d you just say?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You heard me! I said what was that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, you said “What the fuck?” That’s what
you said.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That was great! It was all worth it! Don’t
you see? I felt your anger because of that one word! Well done! I’m
proud of you! The progress you’re making Brandon, I gotta say, it’s
exhilerating!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hey, I stopped by to say hi, I’m
Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m picking now with you and Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>southie</strong>: Don’t take it personal. Chuck’s got a
condition, get’s anxious around people.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: His name’s Amir, he’s a dime bettor. Owns a
dry cleaners. We got him for the subscription. He’s on line three.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Walter wanted your first call to be special.
Go get ’em tiger.</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Yes, hello.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Today’s your day, Amir! It’s a Pamplona
thing, I’m running wild in the streets this weekend! Starting with the
hottest Saturday of my life! How much can you lay with your bookie? 20
large?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –Amir, this is my lock of a lifetime! Texas
plus the six points! They win by two touchdowns!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –Amir, buddy, I’m talking about banging out
the biggest win of your life.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hold on, I got Vegas on the line.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There’s only one thing you have to know
about any of our clients – they’re all in the hole. The second they pick
up the phone, wham! Right to the point! You’re above them! Let ’em feel
it! More confidence! More John Anthony!</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Favorite drink? I dunno, Pina Colada.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink. But
for now, this is what you’re gonna do. First, you’re going to bet 20
large on Texas, then you’re going to put on a</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: … What about payment?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Good question. What about it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We take a percentage if WE win, Amir – not
exactly your problem of late, is it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s simple, you don’t get any more picks.
Comprende? So make the bet, make the drink and let’s roll this into</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: To hell with power ratings – McNab lost his
dog yesterday! Hunting accident. Everyone knows you don’t mess with a
man who just lost his dog! Take Atlanta plus the points and send me ten
thou Western Union by tomorrow, Stan – let’s ride this wave into
Sunday!</p>
<p><strong>southie</strong>: Billy, thanks for the 15,000 Fed Ex.
What’re you up, 160 or something?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: The fuck do you care how he does it? And
where the hell’s our 30 grand for hitting that 3-team college parlay
last night?</p>
<p><strong>time lapse</strong>: SAME SHOT. LATER. Sunday sports start
winding down and –</p>
<p><strong>time lapse</strong>: SAME SHOT. LATER. All the screens are
dark save one, where the last game of the day finally ends in overtime
and –</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Faster daddy!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: 10-2 in pro football? 85 percent for the
weekend? Jesus, you’re a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Go daddy!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Monday’s no good because I take Julia to
ballet. Tuesday I work late at the salon. Wednesday’s a maybe if I can
move a couple clients to after six but I’ll have to check. I really want
to come in with him. Listen, I have to call you back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s all the commotion?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: The doctor, thank God, put Walter,on an
exercise program. I want to be there the first time he goes. Make sure
the trainer understands Walter’s aversion to consistency.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Aversion to consistency?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: He’s always been that way.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well that’s consistent.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Life is fucking… good.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Duck, Brandon, here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ve been tracking you since last year.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Don’t let him steamroll you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –Can I get the damn thing out? I want to put
John Anthony on tv this week.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s me. You mean me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s right. You, John Anthony. You’re one
in the same.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Go on – get to the good part, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hold on. Before I say another word,
understand – you do this thing, Brandon, and from here out you gotta
eat, sleep, shit, breathe, walk, talk and fart John</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Think it over, Brandon, don’t decide now.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It sounds like a promotion.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Bet your ass it is. Five-star.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Well that’s a thoughtful response. Here I was,
worried you’d rush your decision.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s the only move. For six years I’ve been
living on Ramen noodles. For the</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Living, not acting. You understand that as
of right now Brandon Lang with his fettucini knee and his self-fucking
pity is as flat dead as Donald Trump’s hair and John
“I-can-walk-on-fucking-water” Anthony has taken his place?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Listen to what he’s asking you, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She’s right. There’s no going back. I mean
that. This is gonna cost me. I’m talking about building an empire around
you. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Should I wait a little to create some
tension? Of course I understand, I’m John Fucking Anthony. I’ve got the
crystal ball…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I need a new car for my friend.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Walter, do you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: With my wife naked.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think he likes that one.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m scared shitless.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t worry about your lines, it’s all
scripted. You’ve been here before, kid, just think of it like a football
game.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is different.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There’s no opponent.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Perfect, then you’re a lock to win.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: 30 seconds. Walter, we’re not getting your
audio.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: John Anthony, huh? All I see’s another
wannabee in a 1000-dollar suit. Word to</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Five, four, three, two, one–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Welcome to this week’s edition of The Sports
Advisors! America’s premier sports information program with myself,
Walter Abrams, Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler and a truly gifted newcomer to
the Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find – John Anthony! We’re
entering week six in pro football! This is when the cream rises to the
top! This is when things get hot! It’s oven mitt time! This is big-time
ball season so let’s get right into it with the Wizard of Odds – Jerry
“The Source” Sykes! Jerry, what’s the Sykes System predicting for this
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Walter, my patented computer models tell me
we’re looking at nothing less than the perfect storm of betting
opportunities. But first, last week I cashed in a big-time call on on
Chicago as an outright winner over Indianapolis – making it my 8th
straight top selection winner right here on this tv show! This Sunday I
have 5 match-ups I absolutely love, including Miami at New York! Stats,
rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses 42 proven indexs to
eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering. Without my patented,
computer-based picks you have a better chance of seeing God knocking on
your door with five strippers and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning
on your own! Call me for my five games! Absolutely free –
800-238-6648!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Our experts know how to read between the
lines, we know how to analyze a point spread, we’re not pulling rabbits
out of</p>
<p><strong>chuck con’d</strong>: A $500 bettor made $50,000! I’ve got
six games on Sunday I’m releasing absolutely free! These games are a
burial! A blow-out! A human lock! You can bet your children’s unborn
children’s children on these six games – ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … It bites you on the ass?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Not in my case. You tell us, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It sets you free?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s right, but with me it makes you
M-O-N-EE! I’m picking 80 percent, is that</p>
<p><strong>brandon con’d</strong>: know the game! I’m your friend on the
field! Your insider on the outside! You can’t do what I do if you
haven’t been there! Played at the level I have! Maybe you’ll get lucky –
guess right once in a while – but these match- ups won’t be called
consistently by anything other than experience! Forget trends! Throw out
every system you possess! Keep your friends but toss their opinions out
the window! It’s time to change I-would-if-I-could to I-can-and-I-am!
You wanna know who I like – call that little number at the bottom of
your screen!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not here. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s four in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Going for a run. See the sunrise. We’re
doubling volume this week. And doubling it again after that. He can
pick, he can sell, he’s gonna change things around here. He’s the real
deal. Knows sports from the inside. That’s how he picks. Guy like him
comes along once in a – a –</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: – 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Walter, come to bed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not tired.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You’re exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m just gonna run the bridge, up Fifth,
circle Central Park, be back in no time.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Get in bed. Lie down next to me. Come on. Come
here, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just a quick once-around.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Roll on your stomach for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just for a sec. I’ve gotta meet the trainer
tomorrow. Told me to run. Run in place, or from one place to
another…</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: –I know. Of course you do. This is no time to
sleep, Walter… Can’t sleep now… Just because you’re so tired…
Completely, totally, utterly exhausted… I’ll be here when you get back
from your</p>
<p><strong>toni con’d</strong>: run… Right beside you… You go on now,
baby, I’ll stay right here… It’s okay… Close your eyes… Just for a
second before you leave… I’m not going anywhere… I’ll just hold you–</p>
<p><strong>southie</strong>: You see him this morning? Wearing those
suits to work now.</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: He keeps picking 90 percent I’ll press the
fuckers for him.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What a weekened! Helluva Christmas bonus if
this keeps up. Where’d you hide the phone sheet?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I dunno, he said it was personal.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did Brandon take the call?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t mention it to him. And don’t patch the
guy through. Say Brandon doesn’t work here, you can’t reach him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know anything about Stokley being out
this weekend against the New York?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A knock would be nice, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m underwater here, man. Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know something… You hear anything, let me
know. That’s how this works.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ll rush right over. Stat.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: All inside information gets shared.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Inside? I’ve got nothing inside.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: F.Y.I. – we work as a team here, that’s the
way we do it. I’ll do the same for you. So stop holding out on me,
babe.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This wouldn’t have anything to do with</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Listen you little shit, I’ve been doing this
six years to your one.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, it was a fucked weekend.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: For some people.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There’s a 50-dime bettor on line three.
Wants to talk to John Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: His name’s Carl. Carl owns a couple dozen
McDonalds franchises. Guy’s a gazillionaire. That sign out front might
as well be his bank account.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No no no no no. What’d you mean? I landed
that lead! That’s my guy!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Was.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s raiding my fucking lists!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Your clients are jumping ship you lactose
intolerant fuck! Get outta my sight!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Carl, John Anthony here, how’s the
fast-food king…? Good–</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Can we play?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Okay, let me just put the groceries away.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: I want to play princess.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: So do I. Go put your dress on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Easy 200, huh? Here’s something extra for a
cab.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Thanks, Walter. Talk to ya.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, no, you think she was for me? Are you
crazy? No. I just had her come up to pay her. I got her for John.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I don’t give a damn who you got her for! We
have a 6-year-old in the house, Walter! What the hell is going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You think I slept with her? C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Who the hell’s John?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Brandon, we all call him John now.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You got Brandon a hooker?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: New city, no friends, working all hours.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What the hell are you creating here,
Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t understand this. I was helping him
out, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Helping him? Really? Like the others before
him?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This kid’s different, he’s different – wait
a minute. This has nothing to do with you, you know I do business up
here. Why are you so angry?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Are we actually going to have this
conversation? Are you completely clueless?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re jealous. Look at you!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Of what?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Gee, I don’t know – Brandon screwing
someone?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You really are fucking crazy, Walter! That
never entered my mind!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s not where those thoughts enter.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’ll be happy to know he didn’t sleep with
her. I paid her off just for coming. No pun intended.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Julia my jewel, you’re getting big
angel.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Can we play princess, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Course we can. Who am I gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: You’re the king, daddy, like always.</p>
<p><strong>make-up artist</strong>: I made 500 bucks off your picks last
week. I was thinking maybe we could go out later and get a little wild…
you can help me blow some.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Let’s get really wild and you can blow
mine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look at you. I like the tan.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Toni put one of those lamps down in my
room. The ladies do love it.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: 60 seconds!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: John’s up first tonight, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: John Anthony’s leading off tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: John Anthony’s leading?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Somebody tell the engineer there’s an echo
in here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Two years I lead and you bury me in the deck
over a few lousy fucking weekends? The Sykes System’s based on
percentages – the long haul.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, that’s called a mutual fund, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … He leads, I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s leading.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s baby talk! You need a fucking rattle!
Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: See that? He made the safe play. Me, I
would’ve walked, but I’m a fucked-up human being. That’s the difference
between us. Right there. Jerry’s a statistician, I’m a gambler. And
you’re not a gambler, not really – until you bet more than you can
afford to lose.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Five, four, three, two, one –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Welcome to week 7 of pro football!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Denny, it’s me… What’d I tell ya?… Hey,
it’s your money, dude, you won it… Well did you hook it up yet?… Hell
yeah, crank it, let me hear–</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: It’s the bomb, B!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sure sounds like it! I’m heading out with
some people, everything else cool?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: Everything’s great. Did dad reach you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Dad? No, why?</p>
<p><strong>denny</strong>: He keeps calling. He saw you on tv, wants to
talk to you. I gave him your work number but he says they won’t put him
through.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m starved, there’s a new steak house
around the corner. You two split a prime rib, I’ll get the porterhouse,
we’ll whack it up!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Let’s walk, you could use the exercise.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Stop worrying. We’re set–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Let me ask you something, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Have you been blocking any of my calls?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course. You don’t need distractions,
there’s a lot of crazies out there.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Does that include my father?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re asking, I’ll tell you… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hold on, Brandon, if I didn’t block his
calls would you’ve talked to him? Honestly.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s not the point!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then what exactly is the point, Brandon?
What’s the full story here? What’s the deal with your old man?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You tell it, you seem to know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –I only know pieces. I was trying to spare
you from something.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … That’s it? That’s the best you can do?
Hell, Toni and I’ll match our dysfunctional childhoods against yours</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I didn’t have a great home-life either.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: “Great?” Tell him about the uncle–</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: –He gets the idea.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t sugarcoat this shit, you were abused
by everybody but the family pet, isn’t that right, honey?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Walter, please.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s a really scary thought.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If not me, then pick someone else. It’s all
in your head! The shit that happened to you, to Toni, to me – you know
what it is? Just that, shit that happened.</p>
<p><strong>walter con’d</strong>: It’s not who we are. After</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m trying to sleep, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Dad! Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll crush you like a beetle!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How’s Mom?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fucking freak!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I love you too! Don’t wait up!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Are you serious, Amir? You gonna fucking
haggle with me over a measly 50 thousand on the 250 grand I won you this
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, John. I’m thankful, very
much, you’re amazing, it’s just that 50 thousand seems slightly
steep–</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: –The first time you call me you’re in a
hole the size of the Grand Canyon, you’re crying about hocking your
fiance’s ring and this weekend you’re phoning me from a suite at the
Bellagio that I put you in – you know what – I’m cutting you off… You
want to continue with me, I’m tagging on a 10 percent aggravation tax!
Now get to Western Union and shoot me 75 grand by tonight and we’ll kiss
and make up.</p>
<p><strong>woman voiceover</strong>: This is… May I please speak to a
Brandon Lang?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Mom?</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Brandon, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Never better. Kicking ass and taking names.
Did you get the money I sent?</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Well that’s why I’m calling,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Good good good. I talked to Denny. Next
month I’m flying you and him out here. First class. I’ll put you up at
The Plaza. You’ll love this joint.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: It sounds great, Brandon, but the
money – it’s too much. Where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I made it. Earned it. Every fucking cent.
Put it in Denny’s college fund.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Listen to you.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s just how people talk here.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Who’s this John Anthony
person?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He’s me. I’m him.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: And he talks like that?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: He’s pretty fucking salty – geez, I’m
sorry, Mom – I mean yeah. Look, the main point is I’m learning a lot
here.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Then you should know you can’t be
two people, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I appreciate the concern, Ma, but the
checks I’ve been sending – the checks you’ve been cashing – those are
from John Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s mother</strong>: Funny, I thought they were from my
son.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We’re going to Puerto Rico!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Gotta put you on hold, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Since Ricky Martin moved out, all that’s
left are tourists, cruise ships and C.M. Novian – one of the biggest
sports bettors in the world. He just called. Wants to meet you in
person! To-day! Flight leaves Laguardia in 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not much, ’cept for the fact he’s a world
class prick. Bastard treated me worse than my Hong Kong tailor. Never
once returned a call. I’ve been trying to bag this guy for years. Do you
have any idea what this is worth?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, but I want a bonus if we pull it
off.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look at me. There is no if – it’s only when.
This time he called us, remember? You hooked him. Know that. Sweat
that.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Relax, I’ll get in character in the
car.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Walter?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Your vial – where’s your pills, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hold on, Walter we’re getting help! Oh my
God. Listen to me. Walter – Walter. You’re gonna be fine. Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Brandon –</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Save your strength. Help’s coming. Help’s
coming.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I do. I really do love you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … How much?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: A lot! Now don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I believe you. I believe you love me. I love
you too… Just one thing –</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Save your strength, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Would you love me if this was a joke?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m fine. Just practicing…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m okay! Little gas. Must’ve had too many
peanuts on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You sick fucking fuck! That was too goddamn
fucking far!!!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You weren’t listening! You’re not paying
attention to me! There’s no such thing as too far! Push everything as
far as you can! Push it until it starts pushing back and then push some
goddamn more! Remember that when you’re with this guy today!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I start to die, fuck the hospital, just sit
me down, I wanna kack here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mr. Novian! What can I say? An honor. This
is my associate, John Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: You should know I think that most sports
services are a complete scam… However, I hear your boy here’s having
quite a season. What’s your system?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s a privilege to meet you, Mr. Novian.
You have a beautiful home. Let’s start with how much you bet.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: A million a game, across the board.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nice round number, is that our ceiling
here? Is that the most we’re working with?</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: “We’re” not doing anything until I hear how
you feel about this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Do you rent that yacht out there?</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: I own it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well, sir, that’s how I feel about this
weekend. That may sound cocky, I don’t care. I didn’t come down here to
lie.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Do you have inside information?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: If I did I wouldn’t share that with you. My
record speaks for itself. The truth is I know these teams better than
they know themselves. I’m going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that
includes the Monday Night parlay.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Why should I believe you?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can’t
afford not to.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: I can afford to do any damn thing I
please.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Can you? What I’m saying is can you – can
anyone for that matter – afford to lose as much as a man like you
probably needs to bet to feel a win? Winning’s a funny thing,
Mr. Novian… it’s one of those rare commodities on earth money can’t buy.
Or was, until you called me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian
– up-front – in addition to a percentage of every game you win.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Fuck you. I never pay anything up front.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: And we’ve never charged it before. But with
what you’re betting, 250 up front’s a bargain. You want this weekend’s
winners, that’s my offer. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: … Ever pick oranges, Mr. Anthony?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: I have, in fact it’s how I started.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: They need it, Mr. Anthony.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Three questions. What’s your mother’s
name?</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: Shelia.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What street did you grow up on?</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: Atlantic Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who do you like Monday night?</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Pick one.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: That’s your job.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ll do your job tomorrow, today you do
mine.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Pick one. Stop stalling. You know who’s
playing. Seattle versus New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: … I dunno. I guess I like Seattle
giving the two points.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Sure I can! Over 34 points or under!</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: Over!</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: I’m not handing that in. Like a
million dollars is going on that game!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Like a lot more than that. Relax. I think
we know I can pick. Today I’m picking you. The outcome’ll be the
same.</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: What if I’m wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Didn’t they tell you? There is no if.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They score, we win!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: 100 fucking percent!</p>
<p><strong>young salesman</strong>: He kinda mesmerized me, see, and
like Spock or something I visualized Seattle and the over and he wrote
it down! Said picking me was the same as him doing it.</p>
<p><strong>southie</strong>: What kinda power is that?</p>
<p><strong>reggie</strong>: Who fucking cares? He’s money.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Congratulations, Brandon… Or should I say
John? Either way it’s amazing. I must say I am impressed. Letting
salesmen make your picks? That’s balls.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Keep talking, sugarmouth. Must feel pretty
good to be that plugged in. You got a good streak going. Well enjoy it
while it lasts. The gambling Gods are a fickle bunch, sooooo easily
offended.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Here, get you teeth fixed. There might be
some other businesses you can make two mill in one weekend, but tell me,
someone please tell me – where else are you gonna have this much
fun?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: How much of that big stack’s mine?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A one with five zeros behind it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: …A 100 fucking thou? On two million?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re working out of my shop.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I was thinking of ten percent.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Really? Is that what you were thinking?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I got you Novian.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nice job, now don’t blow it by getting ahead
of yourself. I’m looking beyond the money.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You can afford to, you’re holding it all.
C’mon, I only want what’s fair, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: “Fair?” Honey, you don’t know what fair is.
What’s fair is not giving you the money. Now I’m only gonna say this
once. If you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a
sneeze you have to do more than think about it. Or ask for it. You gotta
earn it. You gotta fight for it. You gotta rip it out of my fucking
talons. John Anthony would know that. That’s what he’d do. As a matter
of fact, next time you come with that shit, come as John Anthony. ’Cause
from now on I’m not talking to you about money.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: The big winner. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m winning… I’m winning…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Dance with me. Close, that’s it. I gotta
dance with you more. Listen, I’m thinking of buying a plane. Big one.
G-something. We can just get on it and go, you and me, anywhere in the
world, any time we want. There’s a house for sale in the Bahamas with a
runway right beside it. Comes with its own 50-foot boat. Two for one.
What an investment. Anything happens, you and Jules always have it.
Let’s go down and check it out. Next week, just us, barefoot in the
sand.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: … Are you gambling again, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What? Oh, c’mon – hell no.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Look me in the eye and say it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I am not gambling. Not now, not ever. 18
years clean. That shit’s over.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s never over, Walter. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Get a lie detector if you don’t believe me.
Shoot me with truth serum. Baby – we just made two-million dollars. I’m
working miracles here. Now can I enjoy a dance with my wife? Huh? I
swear, it’s a shame you can’t drink, we need something to kill that bug
up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s just like sex. You start by massaging
the numbers, very relaxed,</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Know what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –Wrong. It’s time to press, my friend. We’re
yanking out all the stops. When you’re winning – you press.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I have a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot with a
client, that Howell guy. Don’t call me unless the lines change.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The salmon are running! You’re staying right
here and fielding calls. You’re not going off to play golf and have
fun.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Fun? Senor, you have obviously never played
Wingfoot.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Stop screwing around, you got a lot to do
before this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m not asking you if I can leave, Walter –
I’m telling you that’s how it is, understood? You want my picks, hell
I’ll make ’em now.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Whoa – hold on – slow down – today’s only
Tuesday, you have all week.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hey – we’re gonna be advising somewhere in
the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nice neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re really gonna make your picks now? No
study? No analysis? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m in the zone, Walter. Locked in. You
want my picks, I might as well do it now!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Okay, fine. Take a break. Go play golf.
We’ll put the picks on ice and look ’em over tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Then the next day!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Where’re you headed?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Some of us have to work.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Come on, get in. I’ll give you a lift.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Some ride, huh? Feel that? Feel that?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Slow down, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Why? This car was made to go fast.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Not with me in it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: C’mon, Toni, loosen up.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I stay busy.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s not what I asked.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What do you do for you, Toni, for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: “What do I do for myself?” If you drove past
my salon and went two blocks down Prospect Street you would have found
me 20 years ago with a needle in my arm. I was a 5-bag a day junkie. I
would have sold Julia to get high. Keeping it all on track, that’s what
I do for myself.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s not living, Toni. That’s just
maintaining. You cashed in.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What the hell does that mean? Are we talking
perfection here?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Well, nobody’s perfect… except me last
weekend going 14 and 0.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Yeah, that’s living.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hell yeah. You oughta try it some time.</p>
<p><strong>chris berman</strong>: – Big loss for Washington, going down
24-12 in Miami. Saint Louis upsets K.C., 34-14. And another Sunday
surprise, Philly trounces Pittsburgh, 23-10.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m gonna go work out.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sit down! You’re watching every game! Every
second of every minute of every game! Don’t even think of leaving!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … How do you go 3 and 11? Wanna know how –
you make Sunday’s picks on Tuesday! It rained in Cincinatti! Two
starting QBs didn’t play! You’re a handicapper, not a psychic!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: There’s still Monday night and the
parlay.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fuck Monday night! Fuck the parlay!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You fucked with me, right? Joke’s on me,
right? The money thing. Okay, I think we’re on dangerous ground here but
I’m giving you a bump, 10 percent. Now what about Monday night’s game?
You want to look over that pick? Because everyone’s gonna double down to
climb out of the fucking hole you put ’em in.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Monday night’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’d bet your mother’s house on it?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t bet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you did?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I like the pick, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: On your mother’s house or not?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: With my mother in it.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh my God – Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>fuck!</strong>: HEATHER taken aback, pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Denny! Hey – yeah, I’m in a bar…. Of course
in New York, I own this town. What’s going on – you okay?… Tonight’s
game? You took my picks? How much?…</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: – A dozen rapid-fire kick-offs fill the
SCREEN – RECEIVERS catch passes, OTHERS drop them spectacularly –
RUNNING BACKS brilliantly juke tackles, score – QUARTERBACKS are slammed
from behind, stripped of the ball – kicks miss goal posts by inches –
PLAYERS are carried off on stretchers – footballs sail through
RECEIVERS’S hands, their fingers clawing empty air – scoreboards blink
outcomes, stadium lights flare and –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Helluva swing. Great game. Sport of kings,
right? Or is that horse racing?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Southie told me where you were.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I had to get out. Clear my head.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You haven’t seen the scores?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nope. That’s how I wanted it. Just make the
picks and get the results later.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Highest sales volume ever. Take a guess.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I think we kicked ass.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I told you. Last week was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re right, nothing compared to how much
we lost today!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … What’d I go?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have an idea. I give you a few glimpses of
what happened here today and you take a stab.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Just give me the numbers, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t like that game. Too bad. Woulda
been fun. Grown men crying on the phone. Wives screaming in the
background. Three salespeople quit ’cause they couldn’t take the
pressure!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. When you lose 10 out of 12, fuck doesn’t
quite cover it. What would be more appropriate is something like “Holy
Fucking Shit!” Or “My Fucking God.” Or “Jesus Fucking Christ!”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Enough. I get the idea, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re right. I mean 2 for 12 on our biggest
volume weekend – what the hell’s left to say? Except maybe keep the
phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tomorrow morning, Brandon! Bright and early!
We start in all over again! No getting off! I’m gonna ride you until
you’re more sick of me than losing! Turn it around and we avoid a lot of
pain!</p>
<p><strong>omit</strong>: Omit</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Son of a bitch… What the fuck–</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: Mr. Novian wants to see you. Now.</p>
<p><strong>bodyguard</strong>: You tell him.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: I didn’t recognize you without the suit,
John.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: This is my time off. It’s how I clear my
head. You want to talk, pick a time.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Or should I call you Brandon? Someone costs
you 18 mill, you do some research.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Feel that? I hate the cold. Winter’s coming.
Water’s getting rough.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What the fuck is this about? If you don’t
like my picks, use someone else.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Oh, I’m not using you again. That’s already
decided. And I can’t get my money back. It’s gone. No, I came for an
apology.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Look me in the eye and say you’re sorry. Say
it so as to make me believe you mean it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You flew to New York for–</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: –That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: I don’t accept it. Not good enough. Try
again.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know what you want me to say. I’m
sorry. I am. I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I am very, very sorry. That’s a lot of
money.</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>novian</strong>: This isn’t going to work. I’ll have to get
satisfaction somehow else.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Look, I’m not it – I…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I scored you the new mikes, Walter. No wires
to mess with. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Listen, I think I should lead off. I have
some really strong stuff.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You got a good hole, Jerry. Stay in it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: C’mon, I went 8 for 12 last weekend. I’m hot.
I’m feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: 60 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What am I, wood?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You got one good weekend under your belt,
don’t push it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: One weekend? The Sykes System revolutionized
this industry.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Take a hike.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You heard me. You’re fired. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not fired, you need me more than
ever.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Beat it, you cut-rate parasite!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: In six years my worst weekend was never as
bad as any of his last three weeks!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Get out! You don’t work for me anymore!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What the hell are you doing, Walter? C’mon,
man – it’s me, Jerry. These other guys come and go.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Think what you’re fucking doing!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I am! You couldn’t pick your fucking nose
without a computer! You’re small! You belong in a can! Show some
self-respect! It’s over, Jerry – leave!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … Fuck him where he flosses. Asshole doesn’t
understand I’m building an empire around you. Finish the countdown, we
got a big weekend to get to! Let’s go, chop chop!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It’s me, Brandon. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No. It’s not a good time. What do you
need?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I need to talk to you, it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You need to get out, Brandon. You need to
go.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I gotta pick a winner is what I gotta do. I
gotta get back on track.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: It won’t matter. You could go 100-and-0 and it
won’t be enough – it’ll never be enough. He’ll ride you into the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I gotta figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Please, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ll figure it out…</p>
<p><strong>brandon voiceover</strong>: Alex, it’s Brandon. Hey, it’s
been awhile but I never got your number that night. I was in the
neighborhood so I thought I’d take a chance and stop by.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Man, you got a Doberman for a doorman.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I came by to take you out for a late dinner
and a couple of killer bottles of wine. C’mon. We’ll go back to that
place where we met.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Are you out of your fucking mind?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What the hell’s gotten into you? What about
that night?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Let me make this real clear so this shit
doesn’t happen again. You mean nothing to me. Oh wait, I take that back
– you meant 5000 bucks. Your friend set it up.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Amir?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, now listen to me – we got a big weekend
coming up, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Still you talk like this. Who the fuck are
you, like this is some kind of game. I was betting a few thousand a
Sunday when I called you. You pushed me. Every call. All the time with
your talk… I lost $380,000 this weekend… I was going to get married… I
had a life…</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: No words now, huh? No more money to squeeze so
you shut up. How do you fucking live with yourself?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I know what the problem is!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’ll come back later.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No! C’mon in. We’re done here. Right fellas?
All through? You want a bite before you go? Something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who were they?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We need a bat light or something, you know a
signal I can shoot up at the</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who were they?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They’re from the Salvation Army. How the
hell does someone go 1-for-8? A fucking monkey tossing darts could do
better!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What’s with the money, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: 1-for-fucking-8!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What happened to the two mill, all the
other money?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was carrying twice that in red ink before
you showed up. The last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off. He’ll
come around. Climb out on his own. Now I figure fuck it! Time to turn on
the lights! Let him see the toilet he’s drowning us all in! Maybe
that’ll shake him up! So what do you want to know? I got three mortgages
on this house, I’m gambling again and to cover my losses I just got a
loan from a guy who works out of a bar on a 106th and Broadway! All this
– everything you see around you –</p>
<p><strong>walter con’d</strong>: … What’d you say when you came in? You
were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said
something.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re betting my picks?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You went 82 and 11! You were picking 80
percent – how could I fucking not!? Trouble is I bet heavy after you
went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet! One
decent weekend and I would have been set for life! One decent
weekend!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: “I know what the problem is!” That’s it! You
came in with a big smile and said, “I know what the problem is!”</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … I’m Brandon Lang, Walter. Brandon’s the
one who played sports. Brandon’s the one who can pick games. I lost
touch with him – myself. It wasn’t an act, man. I became John Anthony.
But he’s not me. If I go back to being Brandon–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: –You can pick again! Of course!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No thanks. I’ll stay here. Eat light.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You want anything shipped from home? Your
bed? Clothes? Porno collection?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Blow job?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Thanks anyway. Maybe later…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Pressure doesn’t help.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: God forgive me, you’re an artist. I fucked
with that. Two little winners and a couple of over/unders. That’s all we
need. You could phone it in. Two’s nothing. Not for you. Not for
Brandon. Right, Brandon? Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: These are the winners?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: That’s who I like.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Brandon made these picks?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You’re looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure, Angel. I need you to root for me.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Why do we like the blue team?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Because Brandon likes them.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: …I’m finished. I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I can’t do this anymore, Walter. I can’t
sleep at night. I can’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not gonna sit there and tell me
you’re ending this because you have a little indigestion or some
insomnia.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s a lot more than that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I made it very clear before we started what
the stakes were.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Walter, it’s over. What use could John
Anthony be to you now? Only an idiot would follow him after the streak
I’ve been on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wrong! Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go
hot. Bettors will climb back aboard.</p>
<p><strong>walter con’d</strong>: They know you! And when your luck
turns they’ll remember you went 80 percent for half the season! We’ll
make it all back on the last game and by next year they’ll forget
everything.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Who said anything about next year?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sports betting’s year-round.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I’m not doing this next year.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You made a career choice! I bankrolled
it!</p>
<p><strong>toni vo</strong>: Let him go, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course you stick up for him!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Who’s side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I didn’t realize I had to choose.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You can’t own someone, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I created the hottest sports tout this
country’s ever seen! I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show
around him, hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be
goddamned if he’s going to walk out the door and take all that with him!
Why the hell am I even explaining this to you! This is between me and
him! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Don’t talk to her like that.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I need you to tell me how to talk to my
wife? When I’m talking you’ll shut your fucking toilet!</p>
<p><strong>walter’s voice</strong>: Brandon… Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Five in the morning. Listen, I gotta fly to
Vegas to meet with some clients. Hand holding thing. Keep ’em on board
for the final game. Because you can do this thing, Brandon. End of the
season’s the perfect place to turn this streak around. I’ll be back to
you out to dinner. Get you back in the groove. 9:30. Nobu. Gotta catch
my flight. See you tonight. Look sharp. We’re turning it around.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hey, I didn’t know you were coming.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Walter was delayed, he’s coming back in the
morning. Asked if I’d fill in.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Julia did her ballet recital today. God she
was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: She is.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I can’t believe I’m here again. I saw it
coming. I just… I just couldn’t stop it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Nobody could.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: He won’t stop on his own. He can’t.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I gotta win one more game.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You can’t fix this, Brandon.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s still early. Come in for a while.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Brandon–</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look at that. With the leaves and all. This
goes on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Happy anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Brandon!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hey darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Congratulations, I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I can’t take this.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: They’re for evening.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>technician’s voice</strong>: 60 seconds till we go live,
Mr. Anthony!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Heads, New York. Tails Denver.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Heads, over. Tails, under.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Ten seconds!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Wanna know about the picks?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: New York minus the two-and-a-half points and
the over, what should I know?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I flipped a coin to decide.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Five, four, three, two, one –</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello everybody and welcome to the big
weekend! John Anthony’s just given me tremendous news about his
assessment! Let me say to all of you who’ve used our service and those
of you thinking of using it for the first time – never before in the
history of this industry has an offer been made like the one I’m about
to present to you now! I am so confident of John Anthony’s picks for
this Sunday, so sure of the skills he’s brought to bear and so anxious
to get you on the phone and dialing the toll free number on your screen
that for the first time in sports service history I will guarantee our
picks this weekend! What’s that mean? Tell us how much you’re betting
with your bookie. You lose, we cover! That’s right! Risk free! Lock Of
The Millenium! Now let’s go to the oracle, God’s gift – John
Anthony!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … Wow. What an offer. The phones’ll be
flooded.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We’re that sure! John, rundown the pitfalls
facing the average bettor. I mean a game this huge, all the added
dynamics, without your expertise most bettors might as well just… flip a
coin, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: You can’t guarantee they’ll win! It’s
insane!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You think? Well I say if you can flip a coin
to pick, I can guarantee the game!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: What if you lose?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fuck it, I’m ruined anyway.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: At least cap it out!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think you do. The best part of the best
drug in the world isn’t the high.</p>
<p><strong>herbie</strong>: Our reputation’s the guarantee! 28 years in
the business, we’re not going anywhere! Bet this game big!</p>
<p><strong>1st tv announcer</strong>: New York wins the toss and elects
to receive.</p>
<p><strong>2nd announcer</strong>: Some bettor somewhere just made some
money.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s it! No more calls! Kill the phones!
Kill ’em now – right now!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Maybe he thinks he already did lose
everything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hold onto that coin you flipped. Game keeps
up like this I’ll have to borrow it.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s not over yet, Walter. I wouldn’t
change my bet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where the hell’s Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re missing the game! We’re back in it! A
New York touchdown and we win both bets!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: … He left.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And you didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: He asked me not to.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just like that? No goodbye?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I’m sure it’s in the letter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sure it is… I wonder what’s not in
here?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What do you mean, what do I mean? When it
comes to Brandon you seem to have all the answers.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: He had enough. He wanted his life back.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He said that to you?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think it’s something else.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Yeah, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You have no idea, huh?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You’re missing the game.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No I’m not. This is the game.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Something was bothering him. I mean sure,
maybe he was homesick. Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know,
deep feelings for me he couldn’t face saying goodbye. What a minute. I
just</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you deny it?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know you did!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Really? Another “lock of the year?”</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I saw you, Toni! I saw you go into his room
that night! This room! With him! I never went to Vegas!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You mean you lied to me about the trip!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t talk to me about lying!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: I guess you had the whole thing planned?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t make this about me!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Put me out there on a tray!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah, I put the tray out there – but you
didn’t have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it! On him!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Admit it!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You played me!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re damn right I did!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: … Brandon was right. Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t deny it!</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: Best pick he ever made.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: You were gambling with me that night, Walter.
Brandon knew it. Knew you. He told me he was sure you were watching
somehow. So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show. I didn’t
believe him – I mean after all we’ve been through – but I figured what
the hell.</p>
<p><strong>toni con’d</strong>: didn’t even stay here. And you… you were
in such a good mood the next day. I figured he must have been wrong.
Otherwise why wouldn’t you confront us? Confront me?</p>
<p><strong>toni</strong>: And now I find out you’ve been thinking ever
since then that we did sleep together? Living with it like that? Looking
at me like that? You sick fuck! You wanted to lose! You set us up! Like
I was something you just toss on the table! Only we booked your bet,
Walter!</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: Hello, Brandon?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Hey, hey the big winner. What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: Nothing much… the usual.</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: C’mon, I know it’s rough, it’s supposed to
be. A friend turned me on to the place. She said it’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: Where are you headed?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: I don’t know, but I got an airport full of
planes to choose from.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: Does your mom know I’m in rehab?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Yeah, I told her.</p>
<p><strong>brandon’s dad</strong>: Great pick on New York. It’s like I
always said, you don’t bet quarterbacks and receivers–</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: ext. Elementary school playground -
day</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: We’re up against a tough team today,
toughest on our schedule. But you’re ready for it. You’re prepared. Most
important I want you to go out there and have some fun. Enjoy
yourselves. Keep it loose. Because you can’t make me any more proud of
you than I already am. Team cheer, bring it in –</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: Go get ’em!</p>
<p><strong>teammate</strong>: You really think we can win today,
Coach?</p>
<p><strong>brandon</strong>: … I’d bet on it.</p>
