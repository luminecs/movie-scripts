<p><strong>photo</strong>: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the
COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a
confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: Wide-shot of Uberman in mid-flight lifting
the GIANT ROBOT in the sky above the city buildings.</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: Uberman stands knee-deep in water. He has his
enemy by the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with
a</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: Uberman stands in a gallant pose with his
fists on his hips, obviously trying to accentuate the “U” insignia on
his chest.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: You look so peaceful from up here.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Looks like Roxanne’s in trouble again.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it:
we’re all supposed to be “masterminds” - very clever.</p>
<p>****: 3.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Theory of relativity.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Well, you’d think he’d invent a wool
sweater that didn’t itch so much.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: The real Einstein once said, “God does
not play dice with the world.” He was right, because the world is MY
dice. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>da vinci &amp; plato</strong>: Sir! Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have
the girl?</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Yes, sir. She fell into our trap just like
you knew she would.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Reporters are a curious lot, and easily
manipulated.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Alright, let’s not keep the lady
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Miss Ritchi, we meet again.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You didn’t need to turn around like that. I
can recognize the stench of failure.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I trust you gentlemen know the very
sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some
say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe
Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you’ve already met my new crew: The
Mad Geniuses!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Looks like a real group of winners. At the
risk of sounding cliche’, you’ll never get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: In a way, I already have.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: We go through this every time. You kidnap
me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes
whatever lame trap you’ve come up with, and takes you and your cronies
to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by
YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What about my revenge?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: We can say it was wasting everyone’s
time.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You have a wicked tongue. I hope you
rid yourself of that when you’re my queen.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m sorry. What makes you think I would
want to be your queen?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi.
And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every
intention of corrupting you with it.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What is it!?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Master Mind!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Over here, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: What’s the matter, miss your old jail
cell?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Actually, I wanted to share the
experience with my oldest friend.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: You can’t possibly believe this will
work.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, can’t I? I have attained control of
the Earth’s most abundant energy source. I doubt even you are strong
enough to withstand the FULL CONCENTRATED</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: We’re now at minimum safe distance,
master.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Excellent. Stop here, I like this
view.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Twenty seconds until impact.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Any last words?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Yes: there’s no caging the power of
justice.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Ten seconds to impact.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Nine…</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Eight…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Hold…on…a second.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Seven…</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: What did he just say?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Six……Five…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What kind of trick is this?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Like you don’t know. These bars are made of
copper, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Four…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: You figured out my weakness, damn you. I
CAN’T BEND COPPER!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Three…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Your weakness is copper?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Two…one.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I don’t think even he could have survived
that.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Whoa! Is it me or did you just finally
destroy Uberman?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well…let’s not get ahead of
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Look, there’s something in the sky, coming
this way.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Uberman!</p>
<p><strong>holy shit!</strong>: 11.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Uberman?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You killed him!</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: You did it!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: …so I did.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: I mean, I know you always wanted to. I
mean, all the schemes all the plots - I never thought you’d actually be
capable of it.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: This is history. Every villain and lackey
in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when
does it actually EVER happen?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Good lord…You do all realize what we get
to do now, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: We get to go on a crime wave.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor
the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as
if you were releasing a baby dove.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Okay, do something like that - but center it
more.</p>
<p><strong>attractive blond</strong>: Tell me how my form looks,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, it’s lookin’ good. It’s lookin’ REAL
good.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Hal, I want to see you in my office!</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: You’re fired. Leave your shirt and locker
key.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Fired? Are you going to tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Showing up to work late. Showing up to work
late drunk. Sexually harassing customers. Stealing from the
register.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Vinnie, I don’t know where you’re getting these
accusations -</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, which one do you supposedly have here?</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: This is all of them at once.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’ve got this one, Benny. So, Cinderella. Can I
help you find your glass slipper?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yeah, I’m looking for a seven.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Seven - Well, maybe I could interest you in
something in an EIGHT. Namely, me.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Lesbo.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: From the angle of the camera, I can see where
you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don’t think
you’ve thought this through. If you fire me, who’s gonna be captain of
the alley’s bowling team?</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Um, I don’t know. Maybe somebody who can
actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you
said you were on the pro circuit.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: No, I said I WILL BE on the pro circuit.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Please, a loser like you will never amount
to anything.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Wow…If that’s how you feel…I guess we should
then talk about what kind of severance I’m gonna get.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hey…what about my ball?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Thank-you!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s…um…It’s good to be back. Thanks for
everyone’s cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now I’m ready
to climb back on the horse.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Someone die or something?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on into my office, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can we get this woman some water for God’s
sake? I gave you two months off. What’re you doing back? People are
gonna think I’m a slave driver.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t want people to think
it.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I
NEED to go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …You’re hysterical, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Keeping you warm before you go into
shock.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
everyone knows Uberman and me were…close. But what I really need - what
would really make me better is getting back to work.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, that’s going to be…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I thought you’d be happy to have me
back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier
than to have our girl back, but…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Things have sorta…changed.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: In three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen, I’m not one who likes to open up
wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were
sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that he’s
gone…I moved Brad into your anchor spot.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s the suits. They think it’s time to
switch things up.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Oh, because they can’t use me to get the
big story.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: C’mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what
we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I didn’t use him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, I didn’t mean that. I know you two were
in love or something. My bad.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: We were.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Very in love.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Okay. So, where are they going to move me
if Brad has my spot?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …Human interest.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Bake sales and pet stories.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I told them I wouldn’t be surprised if you
just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lair.</strong>: 21.</p>
<p><strong>reporter on television</strong>: It’s been nearly six weeks,
and still no word on the whereabouts of billionaire playboy, and
philanthropist, Wayne Scott. Tune in at 11:00 as we look into what has
become Metro City’s biggest mystery.</p>
<p><strong>television narrator</strong>: We now return to “The Hero of
our Hearts: The Uberman story.”</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Just robbed the diamond exchange.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Great, great. Put it on the pile.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Anything else today?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Sir, the new reactor is installed.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Do you want to throw the switch? I know how
you love to start reactors.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What is it, Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Sir, I can’t help but notice that you’ve
been…a little down lately.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: When I want your opinion I’ll beat it
out of you.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Yes, sir, I know, but please forgive my
impertinence. It’s just that you seem to have lost your lust for our
profession. You’ve stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time
watching Uberman specials.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I have defeated my greatest enemy. I
have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand
Sultans. I’ve achieved all I have worked for…so why am I so unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I mean, my father, god rest his evil
and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol
of evil.</p>
<p>****: 23.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: …I sort of have a theory about all that.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more
important to you than you thought.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying,
little gnat to him? …What’s the second part?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne
Ritchi.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi
either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If that’s not love, I don’t
know what is. It’s the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in
the ink well. Don’t you see? She’s the one treasure that’s always
escaped you.</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: I can’t believe you came back so
soon.</p>
<p><strong>friend #2</strong>: Are you sure it’s not TOO SOON,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I just wanted to get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: What we need to do is get you back on the
saddle…the love saddle.</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: It’s been three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>friend #2</strong>: She just lost the love of her life,
Grace.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I keep trying to tell people it wasn’t
really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We
broke up.</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: You broke up with Uberman!</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: You must have REALLY, REALLY high
standards. I mean, you were dating a god. I mean, what’s it take?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Maybe someone who’s a little more aware of
his faults. Someone a little more sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: Right. Someone who listens, sexy but
attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: She wants John Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>friend #2</strong>: The actor?</p>
<p><strong>friend #3</strong>: No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the
actor. Ever since we were teenagers, Roxanne’s totally had the hots for
him.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Well, until he miraculously comes walking
into my life, I’m just going to take a little reflection time for
myself.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Who the hell is John Cusack?</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project,
which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New
life means new jobs and new revenue.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Councilman, is it true that your
brother-in-law’s construction company won the contract for this
project?</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: Well…er…yes, but…look I’m not here to
answer a lot of crazy questions…</p>
<p><strong>across the street</strong>: 27.</p>
<p><strong>young mother</strong>: Thank you! Thank you for saving me and
my baby!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: There, there.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Okay, we better…well, I hear these little guys
smother easy.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What’s it feel like to be a hero?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well…I’m just a man doing what men do. You’re
Roxanne Ritchi, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Were you scared?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Scared? Who had time?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do
is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and
- Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Please, get a hold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You’re…you’re.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Yes, it’s me. John Cusack…the
actor.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
remember something from that one - Let’s see: “My head is screaming `I
want you and need you’ - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel
you - yet in the end, I’m alone once again.” Wow, I scare even myself.
I’m sorry. I’m just really into poetry. Probably because I’m so
sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But
enough about me. Can I fill you up?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: …Yes. I mean, excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Can I fill you up? Your coffee.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I did have a boyfriend - until fairly
recently.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m sorry - this is so surreal!</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Yeah, they charge way too much at
these places - Now back to your boyfriend. I’m interested and
compassionate. I want to know about you.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Things were complicated. He was a man
married to his work. There was…there was a lot of competition in his
line of business. I’m sure you know what that’s like.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Sure. In my business, one thing I
have is RIVALS. For example, mine is…uh…Lou Ferr…igno.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: …The body-builder who used to play The Hulk
on TV?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Did he? Well, we’re always up for the
same roles. Did your boyfriend have someone like that? A particular
rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Well…one rival in particular seemed to get
more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I’m sorry. I got a whooping cough.
Had it ever since Serendipity. I</p>
<p><strong>wonder where our refills are!!!</strong>: See, there it goes
again. Please, go on.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Right, well, he seemed to need him more
than he needed me.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It was conflict he thrived on. He always
said he wouldn’t know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this
guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I think I finally understand…The only
logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that’s impossible,
create one of equal structure. That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for
a part…where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate
times.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I have to go right now, but I’d
really like to see you again - if that’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’d love that.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Got her nose!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’ve got it!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’ve got it!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s plain and simple. Extraordinary
minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither
and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create
a new superhero.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Yeah, maybe that’s not such hot idea…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Prepare for Operation Superhero
Genesis!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Prepare the subject.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Plato, pour the toxic waste.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Drainage.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well, Severs?</p>
<p><strong>severs</strong>: I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside
from that everything’s completely -</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: And this one?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: We attached gills to him. He can breath under
water.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Ah. Does he have extraordinary
strength?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Well…no.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Can he fly?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Resilient to weapons fire?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He just breathes under water, then.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Ah…yeah.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Plato, the radioactive spider,
please.</p>
<p><strong>stenwick</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Anything, Stenwick?</p>
<p><strong>stenwick</strong>: No. Ah…sir, I didn’t know this was about
spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: We’re gonna need more venom.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: How `bout now, Stenwick?
….Stenwick?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: This has proven to be a challenge. I
just don’t know what I want. What do I want?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I want a man of moral fiber with a
strong sense of right and wrong. Someone who doesn’t seek power -
instead, they must have it thrust upon them and find, within themselves,
the courage to rise to the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want
is Uberman.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: That’s it! Why make a copy when the
real thing will do?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: I was just kidding, sir. In case you
forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Then we’ll make a new one. Plato, bring
me the box!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Behold - Uberessence. The very thing
that gave Uberman his superhuman powers.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Where the hell did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun
and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I’m
not sure why I never got around to following up with that.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I believe he defeated you before you could,
master.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: …Right. Man, he was good!</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: You want another volunteer, sir?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Not another volunteer driven by the
need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: …who risked his own life to save that
of a young mother and her child.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Please, please, you’re embarrassing me. I saw
someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I
ask you, what more?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Somebody like him!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work.
He used to teach bowling at Kingpin’s.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: A modest profession to brilliantly hide
his true heroic nature. I love it.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Then you are absolutely going to love this
-</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: - He volunteers at a school for the
blind.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He volunteers. He doesn’t ask for any
reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart
is truly an unselfish soul.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a
twenty.</p>
<p><strong>blind kid</strong>: Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay
up, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Fine, but you better be convincing.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Here she comes, go to work.</p>
<p><strong>blind kid</strong>: Why can’t I see! Why God?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hey, Peter. C’mon champ, let me look at
you.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You know, in life we’re all given no more than
we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise
above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out
there.</p>
<p><strong>blind kid</strong>: You really think so, Hal?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hey, does it LOOK like I’m lying? Now c’mon, go
feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Petey, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Don’t run into anything!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I think I’ve seen enough, sir. This is your
guy.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Then return to base. We have much work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, there it is again. This is really getting
embarrassing now.</p>
<p><strong>attractive woman</strong>: Oh my God! It’s you! You’re the
man who saved that woman and her baby the other day! It is you, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>overhears.</strong>: 40.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, crap. You got me.</p>
<p><strong>trucker#1</strong>: Let me tell you something. That was just
about the bravest damn thing I’ve ever witnessed. Hey, everybody! This
guy’s the hero from</p>
<p><strong>trucker#1</strong>: I want to give you something.</p>
<p><strong>trucker#1</strong>: Lost my whole platoon. They were a lot a
good boys, a lot of good boys. That was just the way things were in “The
Grenada.” I’d rather a real hero have this.</p>
<p><strong>attractive woman</strong>: Hey, you’re on TV again.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: This just in. Upon a second look at that
tape from this morning, which we’ll now replay for you, it appears it
was not the heroic act it first seemed to be.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: With the tape slowed down you can
actually see the man push the woman and her child out of the way in an
effort to save his own life.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I guess that looks kinda bad.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: There he is, boss.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Now, we’re sure this won’t kill
him?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Yes, sir. He’ll just feel a slight electrical
shock.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Slight electrical shock?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: God, I hate the weather in this city.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Follow him.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: You don’t look so good, man.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I don’t feel good. I was struck by freaking
lightening.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: No, you’re just hallucinating. By the way,
we’re out of orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Man…</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Something’s not right here.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Wake up! Wake up, Hal!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Okay, okay. Let’s get it together, man.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: This is just some sort of…episode. It will
pass, it will pass.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well, not too fast I hope.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yes, fast, fast!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I think I need to go home.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Welcome to your second birth, Hal
Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Instruction is very important in the
formative years. Every hero needs a mentor, a father figure to look up
to.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A man will usually find that if he drinks
from a bottle, eventually, the bottle drinks from him.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Who are you!?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I am the guide on your journey. Fate has
chosen you to be it’s champion.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I must be
losing it.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: You know you’re out of orange
juice?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Jesus! This isn’t happening, this isn’t
happening.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Calm. All things must be filtered
through calmness.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Bullshit! Sometimes it’s best to freak out.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I think we must work on your attitude
first.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Look I’m gonna call the cops in about two
seconds if you don’t get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Are you calm now?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Good, because we’ve got a lot of work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What the hell was that for?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Rule number one: expect the
unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Can you just tell me what this is all
about?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: The heavens are not in the habit of
bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for
being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in
humanity.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s me alright.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I am to train you so you may fulfill
your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City: Master Mind.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: We’re are we going?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: To train.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Strength is just as much in the mind
as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Hey, Corky? You listening?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Yeah, work both muscles.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: An invulnerability test. Something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Uh…yeah. I would prefer not to get shot. Do not
fire that thing!</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: You’re bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Okay, do you know that for sure?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I do now.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: You suck.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail. Two Russian
Migs coming in hard and fast.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: What did I tell you? Stomach down,
hands up.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: God, I feel so gay.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Yes, it’s John Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Hi, it’s Roxanne. Listen, I…I really
enjoyed talking with you the other day.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: …As did I.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Great. God, I feel really silly, and if you
have a lot going on I totally understand. But, I was wondering if you
maybe wanted to have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I’d love to!</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I mean, I AM a little hungry.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Great. How does the park sound, around
noon-ish?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Great, see you then.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It’s like fly -
Oh my God, I almost said it was like flying.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: For the rest of the day I want you to
continue to practice your flying posture.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Why, where’re ya going?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: …To do something…mysterious …and
Asian.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Say no more, bro. I’ll just keep at it,
then.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: How’s your sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: It’s quite delicious.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Hope you don’t think I’m too forward. Some
men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really
easy to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: And I you.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You know, you’re not at all like you are in
the movies.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Yeah. I don’t know - You have this strange,
refined way of speaking.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I do? That is most interesting.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Anyway, when we were talking the other day
I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that
we’ve known each other for years.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I know just what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You know what? This sandwich is
disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Of course I already ate half of it. I
wonder what that says about my character?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: It means you don’t give up on a
sandwich. You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to
be all it can be.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably
projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It
might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Is that what happened with your last
sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: When I look back, I probably shouldn’t of
expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one
of those go out and save the world types.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: I’ve run into a few.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I was selfish, I guess. I didn’t want to
share him with anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: It sounds like he was a special
man.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: They broke the mold.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Perhaps not.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What’s the “T” stand for?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Titan.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: It’s from Roman mythology. Zeus’s
father…oh, just go with it. You look perfect.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I don’t think this mask is big enough. Are
you sure no one is gonna recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: It’s fine, just don’t slouch. It’s all
in the posture.</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: It is time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves
- yadda, yadda, yadda…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The safe. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Okay, just don’t hurt anyone.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Well, boys, there’s no need for all this just
to get the free toaster.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What are you suppose to be?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Justice.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, justice, suck on this…</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Now it’s my turn.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Hey, George, here comes the sun.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Say, Paul, your mother should know…that
you’re a scumbag.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: John, all you need is love…</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: …and a good urologist.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Well, Ringo…um…um…you’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: On behalf of the First National Bank
of Metro City, I’d like to offer you a reward for your act of
bravery.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Ten thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I…can’t except this. Law and order is it’s
own…um…reward.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: Not so fast, Roxanne.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: This story’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I
was just trying to -</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: I’ve been in this business long enough
to know pretty well what you were “just trying to do.” Besides, I heard
you couldn’t take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re not gonna take that from him, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: He’s right. Old habit, I guess. We’ll get
out of your way.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: Besides, I’m sure there’s a pancake
supper somewhere that needs covering.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: For months now, since the death of
Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero.
Well, it appears they won’t have to hold out for much longer as a new
costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. Today, at the
Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated
“The Fab Four Gang.” Just who is this new caped avenger?</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: I’m sure all of our viewers are now
wondering, what’s the “T” stand for?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: It’s a message to all the scum out there.
Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is
“Tighten!”</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How do you spell that?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, for heaven’s sake. I can’t believe
it. He misspelled his name.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: No matter, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: We’ve now fully established Titan as
Metro City’s hero. They will love him just as they loved Uberman.
Everything is going according to plan.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You know, Einstein, maybe I should have
called you Socrates. He also didn’t know when to keep his thoughts to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: I just fail to see the point in all of
this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a
pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is
destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to…to…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: I don’t know. To take over the weather,
space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: The reason someone like you will always
be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth,
like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest
treasures will lose their lustre if you don’t have someone to hold them
over.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: That’s it! This balance of the force
bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I’m blowing. Who’s with
me?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You dare?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Yeah, I dare. I’m sick of wearing stupid
costumes, and I’m sick of working for a super villain who’s turning into
a softie.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What - did - you - call me?</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: You heard me. You used to be an inhuman
monster, now look at you. You’re creating super heroes, you don’t go
with us on robberies anymore, it’s been days since you threatened
anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: THAT is none of your business,
knave!</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Hey, you guys haven’t sealed the deal yet,
have you?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Silence!</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Oh, Master, your head is so big.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’m warning you, Einstein.</p>
<p><strong>einstein</strong>: Take me!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I said silence!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Get out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, I love being a
reporter. I don’t think I could do anything else. It’s the consequences
of what we do that I’m having a problem with.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: That’s where journalistic
responsibility comes in, no?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Sounds to me like you’re running from
something.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I got someone I cared about killed. If it
wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t have been involved.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: You can’t blame yourself. My father
used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel
alive.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Was he an actor?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: …No. He was…a landscaper. And a
horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at
his…landscaping. And sometimes he’d get pretty beaten up or thrown in
jail -</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Jail?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: My point is he took the good with the
bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Was he ever successful?</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: God, no…but don’t let deter you.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Thanks for this. You know, this is
embarrassing, but it’s been a long time since I -</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I think it’s starting to rain. We might
want to find a table inside.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: What were you gonna say?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Oh, I was gonna say…It’s been a long time
since…well, I’ve been with someone I…enjoy being with.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: To people who enjoy being with each
other.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, no. Don’t look at me.</p>
<p><strong>mind and john cusack.</strong>: 64.</p>
<p><strong>“john cusack”</strong>: Okay, never mind that. Now, where
were we?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You’re not gonna get all freaky about
this, are you?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: This…this is too much, even for you. God, I
go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I only did this because I wanted to
talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you
sick son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You see, that’s exactly what I’m
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Roxanne!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
it’s his fault. He’s the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I’ll
filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne
Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I should just go up there and just lay
it all out to her. “Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I’m
sorry I blew up your ex. Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less
clown at a child’s birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here?
Who cares what she thinks? I’m a supervillain and here I am acting like
a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Please be open.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: A pack of Lady Strikes, please.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Hello, Triple A?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>shotgun hoodlum</strong>: Shut up, Gramps.</p>
<p><strong>shotgun hoodlum</strong>: Gimme that necklace!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>shotgun hoodlum</strong>: I said give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: The lady said no.</p>
<p><strong>shotgun hoodlum</strong>: What the hell’s that? A super
soaker?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: No, it’s a goo gun.</p>
<p><strong>shotgun hoodlum</strong>: Yeah, what’s it do?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It goos.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s…a prototype.</p>
<p><strong>shopkeeper</strong>: I know you! You Master Brain guy. You a
hero.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Don’t - EVER - say that again.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Are you following me or something?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Don’t walk away from me when I’m talking to
you.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What a minute…all that stuff you use to say
to me when Uberman was alive - about me being the loyal queen by your
side as you rule over Metro City. That wasn’t just super villain
rhetoric, was it? You actually meant it!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: My, someone has a rather high opinion
of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Do you really think I would be with someone
like you?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Everything alright, sir?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Fine, why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You…just…seem…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: …distracted.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Just with business, my minion. Just
with business. I’ve decided it is time.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You mean?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yes, we’ve created our hero, now it’s
time to give him a little motivation.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: How do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: To be simply good is not enough. A hero
must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can
never be corrected.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You mean?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yes, he must lose someone near and dear
to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it’s time for Operation Mentor
Kill!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait
a sec -</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Crap.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: I’m dying, kid. There is just one last
lesson I have for you. It is the most important of all.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Master Mind did this, you must avenge
me.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Master Mind? Why?</p>
<p><strong>“pat morita”</strong>: Because he’s evil. You must stop the
evil Hal - stop the…</p>
<p><strong>reporter 1</strong>: Tighten, Is this the work of Master
Mind?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 2</strong>: How will the death of your mentor affect
your resolve?</p>
<p><strong>reporter 3</strong>: Was that Pat Morita?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: This injustice will not go unpunished. Master
Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Alright, people, we don’t have much
time. Titan should be here any minute, so let’s get the lead out.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: How’s the death ray coming?</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Nearly up to full power, sir.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Hum. Let’s turn it down a few notches.
It’s his first time and we don’t want to get in a lucky shot, now do
we?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Anything on the radar yet?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Not yet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I see. Well, he must be planning
something big. Are the flame androids deployed?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: All twelve.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci,
take your places next to me.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: No slouching.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: He’s certainly taking his time.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He’ll be here. That’s the way it
works.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Unprofessional, that’s what this is.
No, it’s disrespect for the craft.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Would Uberman have kept us waiting like
this? Of course not. He was a pro who knew the score. It’s time we
spelled out a few things for this Titan. I will not be made a fool
of.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Oh, for crying out loud.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Yeah, you’re Master Mind. Yeah! You’re
actually the guy I want to see!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it.
Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have
any idea how long we waited for you? We’re you even planning on coming
to me and getting revenge?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Well, at first I was going to. You know,
because that’s what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to
thinking-</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: -You got to thinking? There’s nothing
to think about. I’m the villain. I do something bad, you come and get
me.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: - I got to thinking…what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Maybe you’re right. What’s the
point?</p>
<p><strong>valuables.</strong>: 76.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: That’s what I wanted to talk to you
about.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Where did you get all this?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Get this: I stole them.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: From where?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: From all over. You see, once you killed Pat
and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I
figured I’d go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself:
“Okay,then what?” I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of
it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well, what about your mentor?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I
mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it’s volunteer work. Now you’ve
always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or
take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when
you don’t get caught, which, no offense, isn’t very often. And that
brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I’m
by your side?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You want to team-up?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could
even call ourselves that: <code>Brain' and</code>Brawn’. Look at
this.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I even designed us some new costumes.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: See, you’d be brain, so you got a little one
on your costume, and then I’ll have brawn on mine…once I figure out the
best, you know, visual interpretation of it. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What do I think?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I think you’re probably the biggest
idiot I’ve ever met. I mean, I can’t believe you. All your gifts, all
your powers, and all you want to use them for is your own financial
fulfillment. You know what? Your kind of people make me sick.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I worked hard on this.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh - gee - I am so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Of all the people to pick, it had to be
this loser.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Now, hold on. You’re going a little too
far.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I wish your mother said that to your
father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole
lot of heartache.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Hey, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Master!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: What hurts?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I don’t need you, I don’t need anybody. I
have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I’m gonna take
back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it’s time for
Titan to collect.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Oh, and from now on - I’M GONNA FLY</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: How’d the plan go, boss?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I just made myself redundant, old
friend.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: It’s not that bad.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Morning, Tighten.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Is there something we can do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Oh, don’t bother about me. I’m just here to
make a withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Say, did he just rob us?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Not sure. Sort of looks it, don’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Should I, you know, stop him?</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: Umm…Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bank manager</strong>: He did rob us, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
When Lord Acton stated that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in
1887, no one thought much about it, but today Metro City is reeling from
that very prophecy. Tighten, who many thought of as our savior, has
turned his back on the cause of justice.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I don’t understand it. He seemed to have
every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well, there’s no use crying about it
now, we must take action. I’m not going to play second fiddle to that
crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: It won’t be easy. Uberman had a sense of
decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was
easily used against him.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yes, but he possesses the same flaws
present in Uberman’s DNA - copper. It’s like Benjamin Franklin always
said: “If something works don’t dick with it.”</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I can have anything I want. I’m like a
god.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Point to any woman in this bar. I could have
her in a second.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Hey, you wanna get with this?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Buddy, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What do you want? That’s the question, isn’t
it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything?</p>
<p>****: 83.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I meant, what do you want to drink?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Your time has come to an end,
Titan!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: There can be only one master criminal
in this city - and it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I guess I should leave town then, huh?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I have a better idea - NOW!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: That’s copper my good man. Your one
weakness.</p>
<p>****: 84.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You know what? You’re nothing but a bug. Not
even worth my effort.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He’s not as dumb as I thought.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I guess not…Funny, though.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What’s funny?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Funny Uberman didn’t think of the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Hello, Legacy.</p>
<p><strong>vinnie</strong>: Hey, that’s my ball!</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: That was a close one. Sixth floor,
please.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Wow, I always thought Uberman was your
first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a
linebacker in college.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: That’s my diary.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: So it is.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well, then I wouldn’t leave it in your
underwear drawer for just anyone to find.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: So you knock me out and tie me to a
chair?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You’re not going to like what I’m about
to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: It’s chaos here in city square as city
police -</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: He’s really out of control.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I should have known. You have something to
do with this, don’t you? - With Titan turning evil.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well, the evil thing he did by himself.
My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring
partner.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You’re talking like you made him.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: And they call me Master Mind.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Let me get this straight. You missed
getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That’s
pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: In hindsight…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: And his powers, they’re just like
Uberman’s. Why would he have his powers?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I had some left over from something. I
infused him with it.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yeah, that’s why I decided to tie you
up.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You did all this because you wanted
purpose?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: He seemed nice.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Closer. I want to show the people my real
face.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Hal Stewart. He’s the guy we thought saved
that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own
ass.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yeah, good to know - NOW!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: That’s right, I’m really Hal Stewart. Former
hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin’s Bowling.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You picked a bowler to give super powers
to?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s a modest profession!</p>
<p><strong>television</strong>: 89.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: With my new found power, I’ve recently
started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a
hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from
being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit
on me - Okay, so what if I didn’t “purposely” save them!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Well, I’m going to make something that can’t
be taken away from me. I’m going to create a permanent monument to my
greatness. One that won’t be so easily forgotten or erased.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: I intend to create a new category in the
Guinness Book of World’s Records by rolling the biggest strike in the
history of bowling.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: My thanks to the city planning commission.
This wouldn’t have been possible without them.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Tell your friends and family to tune in right
here to this station at noon tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: My god, he’s nuts. That’ll destroy the
whole business triangle.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: My lair is in the direct path of the
ball.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Oh, real nice. Wouldn’t want anything to
happen to your hideout, would we?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You don’t understand. I have certain
equipment that’s - that’s highly unstable.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: A HYDROGEN reactor?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s experimental - only one in the
world…Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me
can’t pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It creates 100 times the output of a
nuclear one…If destroyed it could…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: - Vaporize the entire city!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Pshaw…the whole eastern seaboard,
actually. That little baby is amazing. I’m quite proud of it.</p>
<p>****: 91.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Did Uberman have a hideout?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: A cave, a solitary fortress of some
kind. C’mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could
give us a fighting chance.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: It’s under his house.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Whose house?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Wayne Scott’s.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!?
Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared -</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: He disappeared just over two months ago
when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you
killed a kind, noble, generous man.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Looks like you got what you always wanted.
Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: “Metro City doomed.” You know, I never
thought I’d say something like this, but here it goes -</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Not if I have anything to say about
it.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Such a dark place for one such as you.
I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to
your endless crusade for justice?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Good lord, man. You’ve only been dead
for two months.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: A disguise so simple, it’s ingenious.
No wonder I never caught on.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Two lives, yet in both you were an
ideal. Perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’ll miss how predictable you were.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Hello? Anyone here…besides..all the BIG
MEN who are with me now?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What’s the worst you’re gonna find?</p>
<p>****: 94.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I might just ask you the same question.
I had thought I incinerated you.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: You scared the bejesus out of me. How’d
you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my
identity!?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I
forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out
to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing
I couldn’t figure out -</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: The skeleton? Something I “borrowed”
from a medical school a few months before.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: A few months? How long had you been
planning this?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: I always planned to retire -
eventually. I mean, come on, you can’t do this sort of thing in your
fifties. You’d just look ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I see it all so clearly now.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You must have done it just seconds
before the observatory exploded.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You bore out from under the cage. Then,
using your Uber-Speed, -</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: - you made your way to safety, where
you had the skeleton safely hidden away somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Then you must have flown to a safe
distance and waited for the explosion, then…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Man, you ARE smart.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: But why fake your death? Why go through
all of it? You could have just quit.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: But the responsibility would still be
there.</p>
<p>****: 97.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
disappear?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Both of my lives have so much baggage.
It’s time for new baggage, you know?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I just can’t believe it. This whole
time you’ve been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your
city apart?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: I don’t want to hear about it. That’s
why I don’t have a television in here to remind me of all the things I
SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: There’s a demented supervillain out
there about to destroy our - I mean, your city.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You’re really going to do nothing?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Good and evil have a way of balancing
themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up
to fight him. It’s just the order of things. You found me, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: I know it’s hard, but you’ll find
someone else someday.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You’re the only one who can stop
him.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Couldn’t if I wanted to. Gotta a plane
to catch.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: A plane?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Going to Barbados for a little change
in climate. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I got to go pack.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: You were a good foe. I’m sorry if I’ve
let you down. If it makes a difference, you were the best foe a hero
could ask for.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Not smart enough to come up with a
full-proof trap.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Well, you did almost have me when you
figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little.
Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Anyway, it’s a good thing for my sake
that I could always count on you for an out.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: C’mon, we always threw each other a
couple of bones. You would always leave me an out in one of your
`full-proof’ traps, and I’d never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary
that you couldn’t eventually escape from. It kept our little game
going.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Game? - Was that all this ever was to
you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those
`outs’ as you call them were unintentional.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I guess I was never really a match for
you, was I?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Then how can I expect to be one for
Titan?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What about Roxanne?</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: I think we both got what we wanted out
of our relationship. She got a career out of me, and I got plenty of
other things out of her. But I’m ready to move on to greener
pastures.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I guess I wasn’t the villain I thought
I was, and you…you weren’t the hero I thought you were.</p>
<p><strong>wayne scott</strong>: Roxanne! How long have you been…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Long enough.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Don’t you have something else you can go
do?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN
professional, understand?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You guys are about to get some good footage.
I might need a little room, though.</p>
<p><strong>tank loudspeaker</strong>: Titan, we have orders from the
city of Metro to take you into custody. If you do not give your self up
willingly, we will be forced to open fire.</p>
<p><strong>tank loudspeaker</strong>: What is your answer?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Miss me?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Didn’t mean to get you involved in all of
this.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Hey, man! You killed my suds!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: That’s one was for you, beer.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Guys, please tell me you got that last
bit.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You’re kidding me. I give you my sexiest
moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing?</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: We were afraid something might hit
us.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Looks like I’ve given the story of the
century to the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond.
Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She’s a much
better reporter than I am. You want her.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Where can I find her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re actually not supposed to give out that
sort of information.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she
lives in a penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You’ve been very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Master, why must we flee?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I told you, Titan is too powerful. If
he’s set on destroying us, there’s precious little we could do about
it.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: To another city, someplace with a
shitload of superheroes to fight. We’ll start over, we’ll go back to
doing what we do best.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: With our tails between our legs?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Plato, do you have a better plan?!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Hello…Roxanne?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What are you going to do about Tighten?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Right now I’m packing, later I’ll have
a snack on the train.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You’re running away?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: In a word - yes.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You created this monster…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I didn’t create this - the god’s of
irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: There’s no time for self pity.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’ll make the time.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: You can leave with us. You’ll be
safe.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Will you listen to me, no one can stop
him.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You have to try. The city needs your
help.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’m afraid you have an inflated opinion
of me.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What the hell’s happened to you? The Master
Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep
in his heart that he didn’t have a chance in hell of winning it. It was
your best quality. You need to be that man right now…I…</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Sweet words, but that man is dead.
Please, Roxanne, just come with me.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: No…I guess you are a coward after all.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Man, have I got a story for you.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Roxanne? Roxanne?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What pose would be best? The corny folded
arms thing?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Or maybe on the hips, like this.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: No, makes me look like a flamer pirate.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shouldn’t we be making a run for it right
about now?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: The guy can outrun bullets. I don’t think
either one of us is in that kind of shape.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: She’s right, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep
the both of you long, but you’ll thank me when this is all over.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Dad, it’s me… …Bubsy. I know we haven’t
talked in a while, and I’m sorry. It’s been a little crazy trying to
live up to a legacy.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Anyway…You raised me to be the worst
that I could possibly be. And I’ve tried to live up to that as best as I
could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But
I’m about to do something now that would really piss you off. I’m going
to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope…I hope that maybe
you’ll look down at what I’m about to do as not so much a good deed, but
more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you
could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for
probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Well…either way, you’re probably going
to see me real soon. Men?</p>
<p><strong>plato and da vinci</strong>: Yes Sir?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Stop packing. Our work is not finished
here.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: We interrupt your regular afternoon
programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation
in downtown Metro. The former hero knows as Titan is placing what
appears to be a giant ball…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hold on…It appears our own Roxanne Ritchi
is somehow at the scene. We now go to her with a live report.</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: Sir, I think you should see this!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 109.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I’m here with the cause of the destruction
in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he
refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall
“Asskickiness.” He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the
largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City
as his pins.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: And I’m going for the biggest strike
ever.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as
I cement my name in the anal of history.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Annals.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Nevermind.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Like Tiger before him, a young savior has
come to raise a sport from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart, a young man
with a dream, realizing that dream here today, folks.</p>
<p>****: 110.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit,
but you don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You’re right. I don’t HAVE to do anything.
Isn’t that cool?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Here’s one for the record books!</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: 111.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, what’s that flying in the air?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: C’mon, slow down</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Gutterball!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Bowling? What other trailer park sports
can you play?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I
should have done this a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Plato, Da Vinci. Secure Roxanne, he’s
falling for it.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
fruit.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: No more games.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Could it really be that easy–</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: If you don’t mind, I’m going to punch trough
your face now.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Uberman?</p>
<p><strong>bystander 1</strong>: It’s Uberman!</p>
<p><strong>bystander 2</strong>: Uberman’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>bystander 3</strong>: We’re saved!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I thought.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Thank you, old enemy.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>uberman</strong>: Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me
I’m meant to be this city’s savior, showing me that, while we can try,
there is no running away from our true destiny.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Oh…Did I interrupt something?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Where you going, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Welcome to Paintown. Population: you.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Time to finish this.</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Quick joke - What’s the capital of
Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Huh - I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s bang cock!</p>
<p><strong>titan</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: So, I guess pennies are good for
something.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Pretty strange, huh?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: They’re cheering for me.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You saved them. You saved everybody. How’s
it feel?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: It’s a…it’s nice, you know? I usually
don’t get a lot of feedback. But I also kind of caused all this. What
happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What they don’t know won’t hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I guess that is all in the past.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You’re the hero.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I don’t think I’d go that far…I mean I
just…er…</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Master Mind?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>samantha summers</strong>: Who’s bad? Well, not Master Mind.
It seems the former villain has done a career 180 after defeating
Tighten and saving Metro City from certain enslavement. And here he is
getting a full pardon by Metro City’s Mayor, Steve Dent.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: We’re okay, right?</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: And what about Tighten? Is there a
prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace? Well, the
answer we found is no.</p>
<p><strong>prison scientist</strong>: Of course normally he could break
out of there anytime, but as you can see we’ve taken some special
precautions.</p>
<p><strong>brad helms</strong>: What is a Hero? It seems never has that
question needed to be asked more than it does tonight. We go to our very
own Roxanne Ritchi, making her triumphant return to our news desk for
the answer.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What is a hero? Well, there are many
different kinds. There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or
doctor, then there’s the kind the public creates in their search for
meaning and hope. Then, there are those who have the courage to
change.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Hey, gimme that purse?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I don’t think it would go with your
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: It’s Master Mind!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: So? It’s not like he has any
superpowers.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: I’m gonna give you a chance to
surrender.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Four against one. For a Master Mind, you’re
really bad at math.</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Way to take out those two goons,
guys!</p>
<p><strong>da vinci</strong>: What two goons?</p>
<p><strong>master mind</strong>: Sorry, we’re new at this.</p>
