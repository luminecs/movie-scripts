<p><strong>amanda</strong>: My people were very devout, but they
weren’t- financially successful.</p>
<p><strong>delilah</strong>: No shame in that.</p>

sold a good deal of the furniture, but there’s still a nice- lookin sofa

Just wondering- which way must I go!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: The Highway of Life, Brothers and
Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that
way, it will tempt you with many a detour– for the Highway of Life,
Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: It meanders away from the Light and
into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our
spirits!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: It snares us with the thorns and
thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and
laid out on a crooked plan! That’s not the road we want to be on,
Brothers and Sisters, that’s not the path we need to follow!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: We got to get on that other road!
The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one
that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name!</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Praise the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: The thoroughfare I’m talking about,
the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and
by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow!</p>
<p>****: 65.</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: But you got to pay attention to who
it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against
those who will hold you back from your journey! There’s many a loved one
got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the
wilderness!</p>
<p><strong>reverend cutlip</strong>: You either headed for glory or
doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the
Devil- and they aint no in-between!</p>

<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Hell, I don’t know. Just a story I heard.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: There must have been a first one.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: First what?</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked
in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn’t
have no holes and they didn’t pick no cotton.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: House niggers.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: That’s how they called em. They must of had all
their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo
thing- but the piano-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Didn’t bring no piano over on them ships from
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: The piano was just sittin there in the white
folks’ big room, all polished up– and I figure this one boy, he goes
past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it.
And he’s there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and
whatever-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: -him standing there with a tray of white people
food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some
dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he’s watchin the fingers,
see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play
alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the
key and the tempo, he’s got music in his head, in his heart, in every
damn piece of him there’s music.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Down to the bones–</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or
some rich white people thing they get up to, and he’s alone in the room
with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Watch out now-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen
the minuet player do- and he-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some
damage with this.’</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Would have liked to been there. I mean to
hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Mace, Imonna lose my club.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his
liquor, you like to lose more than that-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: I got no more cards to play-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky
Hardaway in person-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose,
conk-headed-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: What the hell that sposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Some kind of guitar.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: A guitar has got a hole in it, that’s where the
sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: They gone and arrest him!</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Arrested who?</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and
sold him over to Judge Gatlin.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Who’s Sonny?</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: Sonny that was here yesterday
morning.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Sonny that got a screw loose is why they
arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: It’s electric-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get
more music out of it than that mess gonna make.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Naw, man, it don’t work unless it’s hooked up
to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don’t need the hollow inside
the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire
and comes out-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: -your amplifier. Which is what this thing
must be.</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: Sonny said he fix radios in the
Army.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Sonny didn’t do nothin but feed bedbugs in
anybody’s Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that
boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin
idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway?</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: Daddy-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play
them little Charley Christian kind of riffs-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: A sideman-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Sit over there and be all clean and polite.
Guitar hasn’t been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters,
sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Old time music-</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: Daddy, Sonny didn’t do nothin to be
arrested for! He was just lookin for work.</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: They hung colored boys for less than that,
darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up.</p>
<p><strong>china doll</strong>: But he doesn’t belong there!</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric,
but I don’t think it’s this no-hole kind of deal.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some
night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Now if he did show up here– and our power was to
go out again while he was playing-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: I think I fixed it good this time, Ty.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: So he come out and plugs his ax in-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: He come out lookin good, from what I hear.
All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the
back-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Clothes, right-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold
teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano,
harmonica, drums-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: You remember that night the lights went out in
the Esquire Club in Mobile?</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: And somebody took off with the gate? Stole
the whole damn register off the counter-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: They didn’t hold it against Reggie Porter, did
they?</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Naw- it was his place that got robbed.</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: Didn’t hold it against him, didn’t expect no
money back for the show-</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: They all too busy diving on the pot of that
tonk game got interrupted-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter
hisself that pulled them lights, did they?</p>
<p><strong>maceo</strong>: Aw, no, Ty, we can’t-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: China Doll, you mind the place while we’re gone!
Come on, man, we got work to do.</p>

if I could just rent him out for the weekend-</p>
<p><strong>sheriff pugh</strong>: Fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff pugh</strong>: It’s not just the money. There’s
legalistic principles involved here. Public safety issues-</p>

<p><strong>sheriff pugh</strong>: You think you too smart for the rest
of us, don’t you, Tyrone? Think you can go it by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff pugh</strong>: You’d rather eat roofin nails than
come to me for a favor-</p>
<p><strong>ty</strong>: It’s not a favor if I got to pay-</p>
<p><strong>sheriff pugh</strong>: Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don’t
hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same
deal as I got with Toussaint. How’d that be?</p>
