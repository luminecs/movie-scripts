<p><strong>registration woman</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was standing there, and it was like the
outside of me and the inside of me didn’t match, you know? And then I
looked around the room and it hit me. I saw my whole life. Where I was
gonna live, what type of car I’d drive, who my neighbors would be. I saw
it all and I didn’t want it. Not that life.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s something out there for me, Dad.
Something different. Something free form, you know? Something for me,
and college just isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s too bad. You would have been the first
one in the family.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Alright. You want me to get your old job back?
Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, Dad. I don’t want to…I mean, I just
don’t want…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m going to California.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: You guys need some help?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I think we’re
gonna like it here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: California was like nothing I’d ever
experienced. The people were liberated and independent and full of new
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They used words like “right on,” “groovy,”
and “solid.” The women are all beautiful and seemed to share the same
occupation.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: I’m a flight attendant.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: I’m a flight attendant.</p>
<p><strong>woman #3</strong>: I’m a flight attendant.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Hey, wake up. Come on, you two lovebirds.
Hurry, I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Figured it out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Figured what out?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: You know how we were wondering what we were
going to do for money? Being how we don’t want to get jobs and whatnot?
Well, check this out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Tuna, this is crap.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: I know it’s not the greatest. It’s
commercial.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s garbage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s oregano. You got ripped off, pal. What
are you gonna do with all this?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: We sell it. I got it all figured out. We make
three finger lids and sell them on the beach. We move all of it. We’ve
made ourselves a hundred bucks. Or a lot of weed for our head. What do
you think? Not bad, huh? I got the baggies and everything.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You can’t sell this to your friends.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Man. Fuck you guys. I have this great idea and
you guys have to be all skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Look, if you really wanna score some dope,
I got the guy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you sure this guy is cool?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’ll see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: A beauty parlor for men? Sounds pretty
queer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing like this back home.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Derek!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Barbie!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: So, this is the new man, huh? He’s cute!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: George.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Tuna.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Tuna, oh my. Enchante, George. Barbie, he’s
yummy. He looks like a Ken doll. Oooh, Ken and Barbie. It’s perfect.
Alright, girls, give me five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Everyone, shoo! You, too, Barbie. I want to
talk to the boys alone.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: What can I do for you guys?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We want some grass.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I know what you want. But, first of all, are
you cops?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Because if you are, you have to tell me. If
not, it’s entrapment.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re not cops. We’re from Massachusettes. I
mean, does he look like a cop?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I guess not. Okay. You know, you’re very
lucky you’re friends of Barbie’s. If you weren’t, I’d never talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s your grass.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Wow. That’s more than we had in mind.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t nickel and dime. You want it or
not?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is it for me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just everything. You. California. The beach.
This spot right here. I feel like I belong here, you know? It just feels
right.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You happy, baby?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. I am.</p>

<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Look what the cat dragged in.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy shit, Dulli. What the hell are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. I was walking down the
beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy. I
didn’t know you guys were living in California.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, but what are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’m on vacation. On my way back to
school.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This calls for a joint. You want to do the
honors?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: No, man. I’m too fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Nice weed, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Fuck yeah. I never seen nothing like it. I’m
fucking wasted.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right on.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: G-d, I’m stoned. I’m stoned. I’m really…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stoned?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I wish there was shit like this back
home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Shit, yeah. Do you know how much money I
could make if I had this stuff back east?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: No shit, Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: When there’s something to move, it’s too easy
not to. Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U.
Mass, Amherst, B.U….</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Smith. Hampshire….</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Right. And Holyoke. There are a hundred
thousand rich kids with their parents’ money to spend, but there’s never
anything available. Nothing good, anyway. I’m paying four hundred
dollars for shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The way we figure it, Barbara flies to
Boston twice a week. Two bags per flight. Twenty-five pounds in each
bag.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You’re kidding, right? That’s a hundred
pounds a week.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I know, it’s a lot of weight.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We’re gonna call it California sinsemilla.
Sounds exotic.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m telling you, Derek, it will sell.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Here’s the best part. We can charge
five-hundred a pound.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Come on, George, no one is going to pay
that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s already been negotiated. It’s done. The
money is there waiting.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Goodness.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Goodness is right. If you do the math,
that’s over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on
this, Derek. Fifty-fifty. That’s fifteen thousand a week for you, my
friend. In your pocket, free and clear.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: And I only deal with you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Barbara and me. No one else.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s gonna work, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t know. East coast. Airplanes. It all
sounds pretty risky.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s a flight attendant. They don’t check
her bags.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Any message?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Keep it coming.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I need more.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What do you want me to do? I can only take
two bags, and I can’t fly back here everyday.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I know, but I’ve got a feeding frenzy on my
hands. Tell George this is small potatoes. We’re missing out on some
serious cash. You tell George. He’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty,
forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand. It’s all there. Wow. A hundred and
twenty-eight thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Jesus Christ, I’m getting a boner just looking
at it.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What’s the matter, George? Something wrong?
You look like you just fucked your mother.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Cheer up, man. Half this money is ours. We’re
fucking rich.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about, man?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The set-up is wrong. We’re doing all the
legwork, and at the end of the day, we’re still paying retail. We’re
getting middled.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So, we need to get to the source.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: Source? What about Derek?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s getting middled, too. And Derek’s our
partner. What’s good for us is good for him.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Okay. So we need a source. Where do we
start?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who speaks Spanish?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: This is bullshit, George. We’re never going to
find anything down there.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You know, he’s got a point. We’re fucking
Americans. We stick out like sore thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You guys are such babies. You want to go
home, go. Me, I’m not going to stop until I find the fucking
motherlode.</p>
<p><strong>rada</strong>: Georgie, we’re gonna get busted if we keep
this up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’re not gonna get busted.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: George, we’ll wind up in a Mexican prison
getting fucked up the ass by one of Maria’s relatives.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hey, fuck you, Dulli. I’m not Mexican. I’m
Italian.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: You’re Italian?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Yeah, right. Gonzales. What is that,
Sicilian?</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: As far as I’m concerned, we’re on fucking
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Ramon tells me you are looking for some
mota.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: For instance, something like this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Very nice. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much
will you be needing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: All of it. As much as you’ve got. A couples
thousand pounds. I’ll be back in a week with a plane.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet
you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come
back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t need a little. I need a lot.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I
believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What if I brought you, let’s say, fifty
thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand
dollars, and I have no more concerns.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: I can’t believe we’re stealing a plane.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Don’t be such a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s fine. We’re not stealing it. We’re
borrowing it. And try to look natural. We’ve got company.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Be cool.</p>
<p><strong>tuna</strong>: You guys are fucking insane.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, pull back the throttle…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not that far, only halfway. You sure you
know what you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Relax. I’ve flown with my old man a million
times. And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it’s the
landing you’ve got to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>amigos</strong>: Hola, George! Bienvenido!</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Good to see you, Jorge. You are a man of
your word.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Actually, I’ve got some news. That fifty
thousand I promised you, I couldn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I brought you sixty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you sure you want to do this in front of
everyone?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous, these are my babies.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: George, you’re a genius. We’re rich. Come,
children.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: George, get my camera.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Take a picture of me, George. Take a picture
of me with my new friends. It’ll be a fabulous Christmas card.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Should we buy it?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>mexican boy</strong>: Picture?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: I just can’t get over the size of that ring.
I just love it. Fred, look at it. Tell me you don’t love that ring.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m just happy that George has found someone
he cares for.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Yes. Of course. But, I’m talking about that
ring. It’s something else. Let me tell you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: George has exquisite taste.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: What is that, two carats? That’s got to be
two carats.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Yes. It’s at least two carats, darling.
Treasure it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring
like that on a construction salary.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, you know. It’s um…</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Oh, shut up, Fred. Shut your big fat mouth.
You don’t buy it all at once. It’s called layaway.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Layaway shmayaway.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: That’s right. Layaway. Something you
wouldn’t know anything about, you cheapskate.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Who’s the cheapskate?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: You, you big old tightwad. He still has his
communion money. Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, layaway.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: The boy is happy, Fred. Don’t be such a
killjoy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Killjoy?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Honey, your nose!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh my G-d, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Barbara, here, take my napkin.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thanks. I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You wanna split?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yeah, I don’t feel so well.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, guys, we’re gonna leave. Let’s get the
check.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay? You’re pale.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I feel like shit. Me and my frigging
nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m taking you to the doctor when we get
home, and I don’t want to hear any arguments.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Would you be bummed out if I didn’t go to
Chicago with you?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, not at all. Sure. You’re right. You fly
home and get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Nice first impression. A nose bleed in
front of your parents.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I
wanted to shoot myself.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, they weren’t that bad. I mean, they
were kind of cute.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Promise me that we’ll never be like them. I
don’t want to wind up like that.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Relax, baby. We’re going to wind up like
us.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I had a little problem in Chicago. Something
about trying to sell a truckload of dope to an undercover officer. So I
applied the three rules of the game under if and when arrested.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Rule one: don’t fight. A trial will cost you
a fortune in lawyer’s fees and the jury will chop off your balls and
hand them to you on a platter.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: George Jung, you have been accused of
possession of six-hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to
distribute. How do you plead?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Rule two: plead not guilty and get bailed
out of jail.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Your honor, I’d like to say a few words to
the court.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In all honesty, I don’t feel like what I’ve
done is a crime and I think it’s illogical and irresponsible for you to
sentence me to prison. None of the real criminals of the world ever end
up behind bars. I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do?
Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants? You say that I’m an
outlaw, you say that I’m a thief, but where’s the Christmas dinner for
the people on relief?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Those are very interesting concepts you have,
Mr. Jung. Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real,
the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did
constitutes a crime.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Baby, you didn’t have to come.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What, and miss all the fun? C’mon, not a
chance. So, what’s the verdict?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
years. I’ll serve two.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Two years. George, I can’t wait that
long.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What? You’re not going to wait for me?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: George, I went to the doctor. I don’t have
two years.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Which brings me to rule number three: which
says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Time is such a funny thing. I look at where
I am now, and in here, time inches along. So slow, it hardly seems like
it moves. But back then, time went fast.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It went too fast.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Surprised to see me?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Take your boots off. You’re tan.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Yeah. We heard all about it. I want you to
know I’m deeply sorry about your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Yes, Barbara. She was very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thank you. Have you been getting the money I
sent you?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: You mean the drug money? Yes, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: G-d, son.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, Mom. It’s okay. Where’s Dad?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: May the wind always be at your back and the
sun always upon your face…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: …and the winds of destiny carry you aloft…</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: …to dance with the stars.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just low.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You loved her, didn’t you? You really loved
her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Tough spot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Not mad.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you
look at me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I just don’t know what you’re thinking. I
don’t understand your choices. You know, the police are looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know. I’m great at what I do, Dad. I mean,
I’m really great.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Let me tell you something, son. You would have
been great at anything.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>trout</strong>: George Jung, you are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Open the door, son.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: I had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. What was I
supposed to do? You’re in our house. What, was I supposed to be an
accomplice?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: You don’t think people know you’re a drug
dealer? Everyone knows. It’s no secret. How do you think that reflects
on me? Every time I go out, I’m humiliated. I see the stares. I hear the
whispers. How do you think that makes me feel? Did you ever once stop
and think of me?</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: So you go to jail. It’s for your own good.
You need to straighten your life out.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Prisoner in.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Prisoner in.</p>
<p><strong>diego delgado</strong>: My name is Diego Delgado. How do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: If you don’t mind me asking, what is the
reason you are in this place?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Your offense? Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my
crime?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t like a lot of conversation,
Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is
no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I
am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now
it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you
are here?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends,
we must trust each other.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Ah, yes. The murder.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you got there, Diego?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Nothing. Just a little project.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What kind of project?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Never mind. Not for you to worry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I thought you said we were roommates. That
we should talk about everything.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is
a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in
Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do
you have?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Twenty-six months.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve got to get out of here, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Only two ways I know to leave here early. One
is to escape.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the other one?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, let’s open our books.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: Man, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: We ain’t opening shit.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: You just the warden’s boy. We on to you.
You just trying to knock some time off, asskissing motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright. You’re right. I want to get out of
this shithole as fast as I can. And I don’t want to do this any more
than you do. But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate.
You, forget about it. You’re hopeless, go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #3</strong>: Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But the rest of you could get diplomas and
get jobs when you’re on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: Shit, I’m in for life.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: I’m a criminal. I ain’t getting no
motherfucking job.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We can learn some criminal shit, too.
Alright, I’ll make you a deal. What if half the time, we learn about
George Washington, and the other half, I’ll teach you how to smuggle
drugs?</p>
<p><strong>inmate #2</strong>: Man, you don’t know dick about smuggling
no drugs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred
and sixty pounds of grass. I think that qualifies me.</p>
<p><strong>inmate #1</strong>: How did you get a hold of six-hundred and
sixty pounds of dope?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine
Cessna. Now, do we have a deal or not?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, the first thing you need to know
about smuggling drugs is that it’s easy. The DEA are a bunch of losers.
They couldn’t find their dicks in a whorehouse. They don’t know what the
fuck they’re doing…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George? Hey, George? I listen to what you say
to the class today about the smuggling. You are a magico, ah?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I never believed you were a murderer. I knew.
I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It’s in your spirit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m tired, Diego. Go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You like to make the boundaries disappear.
It’s not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the
victory. It’s the thrill, ah?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: In my country, I am a magico. A man with a
dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I
have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your
country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you
have a dream, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I would if I could get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you
accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because I got caught.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No, my brother.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because they caught me?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You failed because you had the wrong
dream.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George? What do you know about cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know, Diego. I’ve got a good thing
going already. Everybody smokes pot. It’s easy. Cocaine is a rich man’s
drug. It’s too expensive.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us,
it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN
Miami, we sell for sixty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s over fifty-thousand dollars profit
per kilo.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And that’s wholesale. Cut it a few times and
retail, you’re looking at two, three-hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh my G-d.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a
kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except
instead of thousands, you are making millions.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Now do you see what I am saying?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Getting it here is no problem. Trust me.
I’ll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we
get?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Don’t worry. We will talk of everything. We
have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you
will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What type of planes do you have?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Four passenger, single engine Cessna.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: How many kilos can we fit in these
planes?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. A hundred, hundred and fifty.
How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Fifteen hundred. We’ll have to stop somewhere
to refuel.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone
there.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Great. I love the Bahamas.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Diego Delgado, please?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Allo?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Diego? It’s George.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you
out?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Congratulations, brother. I’ve been waiting
for you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine
down here. Everything is all set up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do we need a plane? How does this work? When
do I see you?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Slow down, George. Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You need to come down here, everybody meets
everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk
about airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t go anywhere, Diego. I’m on parole. I
can’t leave the state.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: But you must. It’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I just got released five minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, are we gonna do this or not?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good to see you, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The
women. It’s better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I
would like you to meet.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each
suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Not so fast. I would like to go over the
details.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What details? I put the coke in the false
bottoms and take it through customs.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make
and the color?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Samsonites. Red. No tags.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the
suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What? Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Whose cloths? Your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My clothes, your clothes. What does it
matter?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: I would like to know the contents. Every
detail is important.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What are we doing here, Diego? This guy’s a
clown. He’s talking about clothes.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: I demand to know everything. I do not trust
six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen
kilos.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: The coca is my responsibility!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re a fucking amateur!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Gentlemen, please. There is no need to be
impolite. Cesar, this will be fine. You have my word. George, Cesar is
just being thorough. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Very well. But just remember, Mr. Jung. I
will be with you the whole way. And I will be watching.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: When you’re carrying drugs across the
border, the idea is to remain calm. The way I do it is to think of
something pleasant, a fun party, a moment of triumph. A sexual
encounter. I actually project myself to that place. Anything to keep
your mind off the fact that you’re going to jail for a very long time if
they find the fifteen kilos of cocaine in your suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: On vacation?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: On vacation for only one day?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My brother’s wedding. Imagine that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: Open your bags, please.</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: Whose clothes are these?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What can I tell you? Different strokes.</p>
<p><strong>customs agent</strong>: Alright, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Three-hundred kilos it is, then.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Has everyone met Inez? This is George. I’ve
told you about him. And this is friend, Jack Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Try to be more respectful, darling. My
apologies. But she is mistrustful of Americans. Shall we proceed? Let’s
hear it again, Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I’ll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
Bahamas, and then to Medellin.</p>
<p><strong>inez</strong>: Friday?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Please, continue.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the
Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Why are you speaking?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: You. Your responsibility is over. You do not
fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us
to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a
percentage. A generous one. And you’re lucky to get that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I see. How much?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For
everyone. For you, and you, and you.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: There is no negotiation. Three-million
dollars. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I want two.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice
ring to it.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: No way. I’m doing all the work. Taking all
the risk, and it’s my plane.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Hey, you guys don’t have to do shit. Just
sit back and collect your money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You good with this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You will watch what you say. Especially
around George. He is my brother and he speaks as good Spanish as
you.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Okay. That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>inez</strong>: Get your hands off me.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Do you have pictures of your kids?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: I’ll need to see them. Also need their names
and the names of their schools. We are trusting you with ninety million
dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens. Without your children, there is no
deal.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Fine. So if that’s all, I’ll be leaving
now.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Don’t forget the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George. George, come in here.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What’s the matter, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s the matter? We’re moving three
hundred fucking kilos and we’re making dogshit.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: A million dollars for our first run is not
bad, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It is bad. It’s chump change. We might as
well be hauling suitcases across the border. We’re getting screwed.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And what happens when these guys stop
paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where
are we?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: That’s my George, always thinking.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: This is only part of the business, George. A
very small part. Don’t worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds
me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it, George? Because I have to get
home. I’ve got a parole officer waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I need you to go to Miami.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m George. Friend of Diego’s?</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: QUIET! Callate! Where’s Diego?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. He sent me. I’m George.</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: Oh, I see. George. Well, that explains
everything. Open your mouth, George.</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: Now, you listen to me. Are you hearing
me?</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: You see this?</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: I’ve been holding this shit for him for
three weeks. You tell Diego I don’t appreciate it. You tell him I want
my money by Friday. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Um-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: You have a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It’s
been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Bad news, George. I’m in Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, you better get here fast. I’m sitting
on…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sitting on fifty fucking keys. Get your
ass up here.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s a little hard to get away right now. I’m
afraid you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>mr. t</strong>: What we’re doing is measuring the purity.
Pure coke melts out a hundred and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
degrees. Cutting agents melt much lower. About a hundred degrees.
Quality product starts melting at a hundred and forty degrees. That’s
what I’m hoping for.</p>
<p><strong>mr. t</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. t</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mr. t</strong>: Holy fucking Mary! Jesus, fuck me running!
Where did you get this shit!</p>
<p><strong>mr. t</strong>: Damn! Can I do a fucking line?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s great and everything, but what am I
going to do with all this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sell it?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Jesus Christ, George, I don’t see you in two
years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of
cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just sell it, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Alright, but it’s gonna take me a year.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Thirty-six hours. I can’t believe it.
Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think it’s fair to say you underestimated
the market there, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Touche.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But to the victor belong the spoils.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Half a million for you. Half a million for
me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Nice doing business with you, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not bad for a weekend’s work, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: Greetings, Mr. George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where do you guys want to count?</p>
<p><strong>alessandro</strong>: On the plane.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What plane? We going someplace? Where we
headed? You have your money. It’s all there. What the fuck is going
on?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, good to see you, my brother.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the fuck is going on? When did you get
out of jail?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch
what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and
done that, well, let’s just say this isn’t America. Life is cheap here,
you know? No offense, but you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Right. Now who is the person in California?
The connection?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just a friend.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We’ll
talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. You do the talking.</p>
<p><strong>large colombian man</strong>: He will see you now. Not
you.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: There must be some kind of mistake.</p>
<p><strong>large colombian man</strong>: No mistake. Mr. Escobar will
see Mr. Jung alone. You are to wait here.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s alright, George. You go.</p>
<p><strong>large colombian man</strong>: This way, please.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos
and makes them disappear in one day?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Actually, it was three.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: The man who gives us the airplanes. The man
from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to
open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It would be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend.
Welcome to my country.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: The man in the garden. He was full of
courage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Un sapo?</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Un rata - no good. But he could have run,
fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children,
his parents, his friends, many people would die.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: But, never mind. I am thinking we can do
much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is
very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much
inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I
don’t like problems.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my
partner. I do not do business without him.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: I like you, George. You are loyal. That is
good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like
me. I look at you and I see myself. It’s in the eyes, no, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for
me in your country, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very
good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: I like to come up here. To make the
decisions. To be one with nature.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: People tell me that I am crazy. That my
business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do I think? I don’t want my answer to
be influenced by what I want, so I’m going to have to say I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Yes. I do not know, either. What do you
want, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I want money.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Yes. Money. Which is what, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Freedom.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Power?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Family.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Beautiful girls?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Keep them coming.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are
right. But money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: And Diego?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Diego is my brother.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Good. Take care of him, George. I’m fond of
him, but he is sometimes like a baby. Keep an eye on him, okay?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Padrino.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Diego, mijo. I’ve made a decision. We are
going into business and I would like to start right away.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Three million. I counted it twice.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s two-point-five, George. I am sure.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m calling it three.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: We’re half a million off.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck it. I’m not counting it again.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Weight it. If it’s sixty pounds, it’s three.
If it’s fifty, it’s two-point five.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t give a shit. Close enough.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where do I put this!?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Try the back bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s no room.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Try the closet.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We’ve got to do something about this.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you comfortable with this?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, we’ve got sixty-one million dollars.
It’s either here or someplace else. We’ve got to put it somewhere.
Unless you want to launder it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And keep only forty-percent? No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Then relax. It’s a federal bank. Guaranteed
by the government. And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking
principles. No questions. No problems. All the pesados keep their money
here. Even El Padrino. What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with
Escobar. Who is going to fuck with us?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>bank president</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I give you thirty-million dollars and you
give me this little book.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I’m married, George. Me. I can’t believe it.
Can you believe I’m married, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re a lucky man, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I love you, my brother, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I love you too, man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll be right back, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>inez</strong>: Look, honey, a power boat.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Great, baby, great!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why are you smiling?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Why are you smiling?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. My name is George.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I know who you are, El Americano. Mister
George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Mr. Jung, I see you’ve met my fiancee,
Mirtha.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mirtha.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Diego needs to see you right away, please.
Excuse us, Amorcito.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Pleased to meet you finally, George. I am
Augusto Oliveras.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My pleasure, Augusto. Diego has told me much
about you.</p>
<p><strong>ramon ochoa</strong>: Congratulations on your conquest of the
West Coast. How much bigger can we get?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sky’s the limit. We’re just beginning to tap
the market. If it’s accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will
follow.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: We are talking about George’s West Coast
operation.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Ah, George’s mystery man.</p>
<p><strong>rafael ojeda</strong>: Yes, where is this man? When do we
meet him?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You don’t meet him. George keeps this a
secret. He’s here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo,
but still keeps his secrets. Even from his brother.</p>
<p><strong>juan carlos “the guapo”</strong>: Come on, George, we’re all
in this together.</p>
<p><strong>emilio ochoa</strong>: Yes, George, there’s enough for
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think Padroni is happy with the current
situation. Will you please excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: You better know what you’re doing, George.
You’re playing with fire.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I like fire.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I need a fucking drink.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Oh, don’t be such a fucking hypocrite. I
quit smoking, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Put that shit away, they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: It’s all so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: What do you think, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Look at this credenza. If you don’t mind me
asking, how much is something like that? It’s got to cost a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s a family heirloom.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: I’ve seen those in magazines. They’re not
cheap.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Come on. I’ll show you the rest of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So, business is going good. I’ve got this
import/export thing going on in Miami that’s been very profitable. With
my investments…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Don’t bullshit me, George. I don’t see you
very much, I don’t want to waste the time.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You come from my body, remember? You’re my
baby boy. The same kid who would jump off a mountain if someone told him
he couldn’t do it. You haven’t changed much. I know the things you do.
Not everything. But I get the picture and I don’t care. I don’t like it.
It’s not what I would have chosen for you, but it’s your life. It
doesn’t have anything to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re like your mother. You love money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, it’s good. You have a family. It’s good if
it makes you happy. It’s nice to have nice things. Are you happy,
son?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, Dad. I’m happy right now.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Three years. How long have we been in
business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she
good enough?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shut up, Diego. They’re going to be here any
minute. I’m trying to concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I’m very angry with you, George. Very angry.
You don’t take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman?
I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You
and me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you need my connection for, Diego?
What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What do I do with it? Nothing. It’s for peace
of mind. It’s for the principle.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain’t telling
you. It’s just business. Now, shut up. You’re driving me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I’m driving you crazy? No. You’re driving me
crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Algun problema?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No no no… no problema, amigo. El dinero esta
todo aqui. Lleves las “llaves” y mas tarde lo contaremos. Okay? No
problem.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Que problema? Nosotros esperamos.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You embarrassed me, George. You make me look
very bad.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Que esta diciendo?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing. Todo esta bien.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Everything is not alright. I bring you in,
and you slap my fucking face!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is not the time, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hay algun problema? Hablame!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You fucked me in front of my whole
family!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck you…I didn’t fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Esta todo aqui, amigo…take the keys. Take
’em and go.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le
importa.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Take it easy! Everything’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
campesinos?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Take the fucking keys!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Estoy bien, okay? Everything is alright.
There’s no problem. Okay? This never happened. No one has to know
anything about this. Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the
fucking coke is. Do it now.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No problem, gentlemen. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Derek Foreal.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Derek Foreal. Derek Foreal. Derek fucking
Foreal. Alright? The answer to all your dreams. Are you happy now?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hello, hello.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: I’m so glad you two could make it. Mirtha,
look at you. So beautiful. You look like you’re about to burst.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Thanks. I am. Where’s Martha?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: I don’t know. Drunk somewhere. Try the bar.
And if you find her, tell her to come, it’s almost midnight.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: It’s good you came down, George. We need to
discuss a few things.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Where’s Diego?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: He’s not here, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, well where is he? And who is this
Norman K. guy? That’s all anyone is talking about. Norman K. Norman K.
Do I know him?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Norman Cay is not a person. He is an
island, George. In the Bahamas. From what they say, it is free and it’s
Diego’s new home.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Let us walk. From what I understand, Diego
has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
airstrip.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Motherfucker works fast.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: The word is that soon he is to be king of
the middle empire. He is doing multiple runs right now and using the
island as a jump-off point.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Yes. Jack Stevens is already a very busy
man. Along with many others. You shouldn’t stay away so long.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s impossible. We can’t be up and
running. Who’s distributing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Derek? This is George. Am I wearing
lipstick? I said, am I wearing lipstick? Because when I’m getting
fucked, I want to make sure my face is pretty. You’re buying directly
from Diego, aren’t you, you son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I don’t want to get caught in the middle of
this. That’s between you and Diego.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: It’s nothing personal, George. Just
business.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. I understand. Just business. Right.
Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I bring you in, and this is how you repay
me? You little homo! Hey, Derek? Derek?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Que va hacer?</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Que queres decir. Que es lo que el va
hacer? Pues, no va hacer nada.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.</p>
<p><strong>family member #2</strong>: De otra manera, es un marica.</p>
<p><strong>family member #3</strong>: Un hijueputa</p>
<p><strong>family member #1</strong>: Maricon.</p>
<p><strong>family member #2</strong>: Mira, vos sos responsable por el
exito de Diego.</p>
<p><strong>family member #3</strong>: El se esta burlando de vos. Debes
hacer algo, hombre.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No Puedes hacer ni un culo.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: El no va hacer nada. Hay un problema. Aqui,
hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos ha arreglar.</p>
<p><strong>blanca</strong>: No le escusches a mi yerno. A el solo le
importa la plata.</p>
<p><strong>blanca</strong>: Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo. De lo
contrario vas a quedar como un marica sin horror.</p>
<p><strong>family member #3</strong>: Mejor dicho vos sos un
aculillado.</p>
<p><strong>family member #1</strong>: Maricon.</p>
<p><strong>blanca</strong>: Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones. Nadie te
va a respetar. Usa esto. Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni
sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Blanca, por favor.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a
matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los
ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un
hijueputa carro encima.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Dejen la maricada pues! No jodan! Nadie va
a matar a nadie! George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera,
mano.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Good to see you, George. It’s been a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, I am happy to see you. How are you,
my brother?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No more brothers, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Of course we are brothers. Why do you say
that? You hurt me, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You fucked me, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You went behind my back and you cut me
out.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No, I never. I would not do that, George.
Never.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I talked to Foreal, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Maybe you are right. I did betray you a
little bit.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo. So sad, George. I stole
your California connection. So what? Who introduced you to Pablo
Escobar? Me. Who introduced you to your fucking Colombian wife? Me. Who
protected you when my friend Cesar Roza wanted to slice your fucking
throat, huh? Who mad you millions and millions of dollars? Me. And what
do I get in return? This? Accusations? I have always given you
everything, George, but that is over now. This is my operation. My
dream. So go home, George. Go back to your stupid little life. You can
sell half grams to your fucking relatives for all I care. Because you
are out!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’d better kill me now, Diego, because
you’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: George, don’t be so emotional. This is
business. Besides, I can’t kill you, you are my brother.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Say “hi” to your pretty wife for me.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: George, you look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Diego?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Please. Sit down. We’ll drink some
scotch.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t come here to drink scotch.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: I see. I’m sorry about this, George. I’m
not happy about this situation. It’s bad. You now know who your Brutus
is.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know why I’m here. You know what I have
to do. I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo. This is
bullshit, he’s making me look like a punk.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: It is very difficult. Diego makes me a lot
of money. If Diego goes so does the money. You were an excellent
teacher, George. When the student has learned well, the teacher is no
longer necessary. We must remember we have wives, friends, familia. Even
familia that has not been born. But sometimes, we must forget as well. I
am like you. I must teach the lesson. We want to teach the lesson. But
we cannot. We must remember that life is the teacher.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re saying life will take care of
Diego?</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Life will take care of everybody. Diego,
me, you. It is the teacher.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I get it. I’m really pissed, Pablo. You know
the DEA knows about Norman’s Cay. For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf
Hitler and John Lennon, that’s fucked up!</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: I’m sorry, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, well, what are you gonna do? You and
me, Pablo? Are we good?</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: Of course, George. We are beautiful. We are
brothers. Real brothers. Not like Diego. We started this, George.</p>
<p><strong>escobar</strong>: And, George? The vengance? It is best
served cold.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shhh, honey, never mind. It’s alright. It’s
over. I quit the business. I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Pablo said no?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pablo said no. It’s all over. And I’m never
going back. I have you. We have the baby. And there’s nothing else. It’s
just the family now. Shhh. Sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: George, it’s time! George! George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Watching my baby girl born did something to
me. They talk about religious experiences, I didn’t believe in religion.
But when Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this world, something in me
changed. I looked at her and I knew right then that I could never love
anything but my daughter ever again. It sounds sappy, but it was like,
click, I knew what I was put on this planet for. It was the greatest
feeling I ever had followed by the worst feeling I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He fainted.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: George!</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: He’s in tachycardia. George, your heart is
racing. Have you been using drugs?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Coke.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: Cocaine? How much?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe eighteen grams.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: In how long? A week?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and
start an i.v. stat! This man is having a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: I’ve reviewed your toxicology report three
times, George. I’ve never seen anything like it. Eighteen grams. The
lethal dose is a gram and a half. You should be in the Guiness Book.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bay</strong>: It’s not funny, George. You should be dead
right now. Absolutely. I cannot come up with one logical explanation for
why you’re still breathing. I’m not here to give you lectures, I’ve got
no moral interest in what you do. But, take it easy, George. Stay with
us a while. You’ve got a daughter now.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Come on. Come on, honey. You can do it. Come
to Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good girl!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, Mirtha. She’s walking.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: She did that before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. These are her first steps. Watch
her.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Yeah. I know. She did that before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But this is…</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I said, I’ve seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Can you lift the furnace. I need money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Happy Birthday, George. Mirtha invited
me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. She told me.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Look, I’m sorry about everything. I feel like
an idiot. You were right. I did fuck you. And then Diego fucked me. Cut
me out, too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: I lost sight of everything. Forgot who my
friends were.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s in the past. I’m out of the business
now, so forget about it. No hard feelings. We need to move on. And
besides, I’m sorry, too.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: For calling you a homo.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: That was out of line.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good to see you, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Now let’s fucking party, motherfuckers!
Let’s have some fucking fun.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Jesus, is that Mirtha!?</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Christ almighty, George. Feed her a
cheeseburger or something. What does she weight, eighty pounds?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know. She needs to slow down. She’s going
to blow an O-ring.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Happy birthday, baby. Do a line.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, that’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Oh fucking relax. Let your hair down for
once. It’s your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes. You’re such a fucking
pussy. I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up
with the maid.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No honey, I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: A toast! To Mister George Jung. Mr. I 95,
north and south. My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!</p>
<p><strong>everyone</strong>: To George!</p>
<p><strong>party guest</strong>: Cops! They’re all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Massachusetts State Police Department!
Everybody on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>detective #2</strong>: It’s your statement. How it was all
yours, the pound of coke was for personal use and none of the guests had
any idea it was there, yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I want my kid out of protective custody.
Now. No fucking around. My wife and my kid on a plane tonight. I sign
when they call me safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck you, then. I sign nothing.</p>
<p><strong>detective #2</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: George? You better get yourself a good
lawyer this time. We’re gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh hey, one more thing?</p>
<p><strong>detective #1</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Get me a six pack.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I heard. Ermine, your son is here.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Tell him I don’t want to see him. Tell him
he’s not welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>ermine</strong>: Don’t you dare step one foot in this house.
You’re not my son, you hear me? I don’t have a son anymore.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: She’s angry. It’s all over the news.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. Listen. I’m going to be going away for
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re not going to trial?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Give this to Mom, will you?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Money. You and your mother. All the time
chasing it. I never understood it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Give it to her, Dad. It’ll make her
happy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah, I know. This is it, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tell Mom, you know…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’d like to make a withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>bank employee</strong>: Excuse me, please.</p>
<p><strong>bank president</strong>: I’m afraid there is a problem,
Mr. Jung. The banks have gone through a change, a nationalization. I’m
afraid your funds have been appropriated by the Panamanian
Government…</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: What are we going to do?! What are we going
to use for money?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Please, Mirtha. I’ll start working for
Augusto. I’ll talk to him tonight. I’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Don’t touch me. Tell me. Just answer the
question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Not in front of the kid.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Don’t give me that shit. You just better do
something.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Everything’s gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Don’t be upset.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: What’s happening to us?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Are we gonna split up?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, never. Don’t even think about that, it’s
impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live
without my heart? Could I?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be
cool, will ya.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, why don’t you just put a “I’m doing
cocaine” sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: My problem? We’re broke, that’s my fucking
problem. And you’re a fucking spy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: That’s right. Always spying, always judging.
Everyone’s laughing at you, you fucking pussy. You let Diego fuck you in
the ass. Maybe you are a fucking faggot. You must be fucking Diego
because you’re not fucking me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Those are my nuts!</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: He’s a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
dealer! There’s a kilo in his trunk right now! Take this sorry
motherfucker to jail!</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I’m divorcing you, George. I’m getting
custody of Kristina. And when you get out next week, you’re going to pay
support and that’s the end of it. Alright? There’s someone else. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: You should have taken better care of me, you
know? You’ve been away a long time. Four years. Say something.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you want me to say? I’m in prison.
You should know. You put me here.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Fuck you, George. I knew you’d say something
like that. Always thinking about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My baby. She’s so big.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I thought you couldn’t live without your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Derek? It’s George. Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I’m in Miami. I’m looking to do something. I want to put together a
crew. Do you know anybody? Leon? I don’t know him. What’s his last name?
Alright. Give me the number.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was
out. I just wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Well, here I am. See?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: George, you just can’t show up, tell me
you love me, and have everything be okay.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You can call me Dad if you want.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I don’t want, alright? It’s not funny. I’m
really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Kristina, c’mon, I’m sorry. I’m going to
make this right. I’ve got a few things going on…</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad
again.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Do what you want, it’s a free country.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s a four-man operation. Two on the ground.
Two in the air.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who’s the co-pilot?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re looking at him. We provide the plane,
transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want
it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are
responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take
sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross,
plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with
you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sounds fine. I’ll need to meet
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: They’re over at the booth.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Gentlemen, this is George. George, this is
Ben, G.G. and…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Holy shit, Dulli!</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen
years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was
roughly five-hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for
five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That’s all I
needed.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,
Georgie. Why don’t we start small?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. I have the space. I figured it out. This
is what I want to do.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Alright. I’ll ask Pablo, tell him it’s for
you. I don’t think there will be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Five-thousand per kilo.</p>
<p><strong>augusto</strong>: Ha ha. That’s too much, Georgie. Those days
are over. The rate is one-thousand dollars. Inflation, you know?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I’m
out. Give me a good price for old time’s sake. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let me ask you something. If you could go
anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: You mean, like a trip?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, sure, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe California.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: California? You can go anywhere in the
world. India. Tibet. Australia. Paris. And you choose California?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What is it? A Disneyland thing?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: No. I just kind of like the sound of
it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: California, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: California.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Go on inside now. I want to talk to your mom
alone.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Bye, Dad. See you in the morning,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Yeah. She told me. You walk her to
school.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, so I’ve been thinking. I love her,
y’know? I kind of want to have her. I’ve been away for so long. Make up
for the missed time, you know?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: I haven’t seen one dollar from you. You
haven’t paid me one cent in child support, alimony.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, well. I’m working on that. I’ve got
something going.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Yeah? I better see some money out of it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, you will. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what
will happen. You’re a good father, George. I always gave you that. But
you’ve got to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: She’s getting big. Getting her own
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know. Well, that’s all I really wanted to
say. So, okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Hey, George. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday, refuel,
and be in Medellin by Monday.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday
night.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Where are you coming in?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Vero Beach.</p>
<p><strong>g.g.</strong>: It’s good. It’s small.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house where
it stays until pick up and payment the next morning. You want to go over
it again?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. All set. Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m thinking about getting out of town this
week. You want to come with me?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe California.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: You swear?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what
it’s like. I’ve got some stuff to do this week, but I’m thinking maybe
Thursday. Thursday after school.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: You know I can’t. Mom will never let me
go.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You let me take care of your mother. You
just pack your bags.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: But I’ve got school.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’s schools in California.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: You swear?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s right. Three o’clock. Thursday. At
your mother’s. You and me. It’s a date.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I swear. On my life.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Swear on my life.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I swear on your life.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are we good?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are we good? Yeah, we’re good. We’re
beautiful. We’re perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure
Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven
snow. Good riddance.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You saved my life, Dulli. You’ll never
fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten
percent, you get fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That’s an
extra two-hundred large.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t give a shit. Split it up. Have a
great life. I’m done. I’m out. Starting over. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah! Unbelievable. Dulli, pour us another
round. I gotta hit the head.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>g.g.</strong>: I feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Me too. He’s not such a bad guy.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Fuck you guys. All of you. I’ve known him for
thirty fucking years. Fucking George.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah, I like him, too. But what’s done is
done. So let’s not get all sentimental about it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Dulli, I was just thinking about that time
we landed in Mexico. You’ve gotten a lot better since then, huh pal?
Remember that fucking landing strip? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, what’s wrong fellas? Why the long
faces?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No. C’mon, Dulli.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I was busted. Set up by the FBI and the DEA.
That didn’t bother me. Set up by Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save
their own asses. That didn’t bother me. Sentenced to sixty years at
Otisville. That didn’t bother me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I had broken a promise. Everything I loved
in my life goes away.</p>
<p><strong>zigmond</strong>: Here’s the deal, George. You’re not getting
out. I tried to get you furloughed, but your mother squashed it. Said it
would only upset him. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>zigmond</strong>: Well, he’s out of the hospital, but there’s
not much anyone can do for him. It’s just a matter of time. Listen, I
brought a tape recorder in case you wanted to say something to him. That
way he could hear your voice.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hello, Dad…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I was
about three-and-a-half feet tall, weighing all of sixty-pounds, every
inch your son…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …those Saturday mornings going to work with
my Dad. We’d climb into that big yellow truck. I used to think it was
the biggest truck in the world.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I remember how important the job we did was.
How if it weren’t for us, people would freeze to death. I thought you
were the strongest man in the world.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Remember those home movies when Mom would
dress up like Loretta Young? And the ice creams and the football games?
Waino, the Tuna, and the day I left for California only to come home
with the FBI chasing me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And that FBI agent, Trout? When he had to
get on his knees to put my boots on? You said…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s where you belong…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: …you sonofabitch. Putting on George’s
boots.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That was a good one, Dad. That was really
something. Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And that time you told me that money wasn’t
real? Well, old man, I’m forty two years old. I finally learned what you
tried to tell me so many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I finally understand. You’re the best, Dad.
I just wish I could have done more for you. I wish we had more time.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I guess I kind of lost sight of things. “May
the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and
the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.” Love,
George.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That was a beautiful message.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I meant every word of it.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Did you know I died two weeks after you sent
me that tape?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, Dad. I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: How are you doing, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you guys want?</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: You hear about your old friend, Diego?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What the fuck? Is he going to walk?</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: He’s going down, George. It’s election year.
We’re not making any deals.</p>
<p><strong>fbi guy #1</strong>: He’s never getting out. Orders from the
top.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: So, how would you like to help us put him
away?</p>
<p><strong>fbi guy #2</strong>: We’ve done our homework. We know you
hate this motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>garcia</strong>: Don’t be stupid, George. We’ve got him.
We’ve got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so
we’re handing out free passes on this one. And the first one’s got your
name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No thanks, fellas. You’ve got the wrong
fucking guy. I’m not a rat.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mirtha, what’s going on? Everything okay
with Kristina?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Kristina’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Is she here? Is she coming?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You
fucked her over one too many times. And I’m not here to socialize. Did
you hear about Diego?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this
thing with Diego is a disaster. He’s giving up lab locations, names,
bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His
exact words were “Fuck Diego.”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He wants me to testify? Is that what he’s
asking me to do?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: George, he wasn’t asking.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mirtha, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mirtha</strong>: Better than you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, Arch, you think the judge will let us
get a cocktail after this is all over?</p>
<p><strong>zigmond</strong>: I’ll see what I can do, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks, Arch.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sir, please state your name.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m George Jung. Spelled J-U-N-G.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Do you see him here in the
courtroom?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, he’s sitting right there at the end of
the table.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Let the record state the witness has
identified, Diego Delgado.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Mr. Jung, can you describe the
circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with
Mr. Delgado?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal
Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for
was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in
Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine
into America…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The first run was fifteen kilos, which we
smuggled into Logan Airport in hard shelled suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen cabinet
paper, and duct tape, that way if there were any dogs in customs…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of cocaine per week into the United
States via twin-engine Cessnas. Jack would fly into North Carolina, we’d
meet him there and drive it down to different distribution points…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I never met Pablo Escobar. Diego Delgado was
my only connection to cocaine from Colombia…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Diego convinced me to keep most of my money
in a Panamanian bank. Diego had a close relationship with Manuel
Noriega. In exchange for allowing us to keep our money there, we paid
him a percentage.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There was an 85% chance that if you snorted
cocaine between 1977-1984, it was ours. Initially with my LA
connections, we invented the marketplace. In 1977, there was no other
real competition.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The first year we made about 100 million
dollars between us. It was an expensive operation. Eventually we built
up to three different pilots doing multiple runs per week, connections
on both coasts, everything was running smooth. We were like a
corporation…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: he was very anti-government. He talked about
revolution, forming his own country or island, he was looking for power
as well as money. I was just looking for money.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He disliked the United States, thought it
was a police state. He hoped that by flooding the country with cocaine,
it would disrupt the political system and tear down the morality of the
country.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my connection, I
met him back in 1968 when I first moved to Manhattan Beach. It was
Foreal’s marijuana connections that kicked off our cocaine market.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos to
Los Angeles. When Diego finally got Derek Foreal’s name from me, it was
only a matter of months before he’d cut me out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not sure how my relationship with my
daughter and ex-wife have anything to do with this trial. I mean we’re
here to talk about Diego Delgado, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Yes, we are Mr. Jung.</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Mr. Jung, you’re a convicted felon,
correct?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Do you have any agreement or
understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to
your testimony?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I cam here out of my own volition.</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Something about vengance being best served
cold.</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Really. Are you getting paid,
Mr. Jung?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: Mr. Jung, don’t you have an agreement or
understanding with the United States Government in connection with your
testimony in this case?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m doing sixty years at Otisville, no
chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I’ll be
seventy-three years old. That’s some fucking deal. I don’t know if the
parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out
of here. I have a really bad record, I’m not sure what’s going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: So you do have an agreement with the
United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?</p>
<p><strong>calibanos</strong>: I thought so. No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You shouldn’t have taken the 30 million,
Diego, I was out.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I’m here to see my father.</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Kristina Sunshine Jung.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Jung.</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Belongings in here.</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Feet on the blue line.</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Miss?</p>
<p><strong>admissions officer</strong>: Miss? Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: George? George, come on. You’ve got a
visitor.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry, baby. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: It’s alright, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I know, Dad. I know…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I love you. I love you so much. You’ve got
to know that. You’ve got to know.</p>
<p><strong>kristina</strong>: I know, Dad. I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: After everything. After everything, the only
thing left out of my whole life is you.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: George? George, come on. It’s getting
dark.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I have a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Not today, George. Time to go back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I want to put her name on the list for
tomorrow. My daughter.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: Okay, George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Because she’s visiting me.</p>
<p><strong>gus</strong>: We’ll do that tomorrow, okay? It’s lockdown
time.</p>
