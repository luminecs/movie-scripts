<p><strong>luke</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: How did you even get here? There’s no
road.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m from Utah.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: Are you alone out here?</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: My husband. Bastard. I’ve been driving for
days. I don’t even know where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, wow. I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Uh, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: Pastry.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: So, this “Survival Quest” is your
vacation?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. It’s my third try. Kind a’ lame,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: No. Seven days alone in the wilderness? I’d
be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s just something I really wanted to do.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: His shoes. Fishing lures. The electric
drill.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: You’re all wet and muddy. Why don’t I hang
those up to dry?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>alexa</strong>: I’m propositioning you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh… Oh, wow. You are?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s remarkable. Sort of retro. I thought
you were gettin’ a pickup?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: It’s awesome. It’s pleather.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Fuck you. You think it’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh my God. You got laid. Finally! Who is
she?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I didn’t say a word! I swear! You know
Janine. She’s got X-ray vision. Camping! A total stranger.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I knew that whole “waitin’ to meet the right
girl” thing was crap. Congratulations! I have to get to Physics. The
truck’s great.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: See ya’, hottie.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Could find something to call me, other than
what every guy in the world would say?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: “Sweetheart?” “Babe?” “Aphrodite?”</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: So this is gonna’ be like your car?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look, I know it’s dopey. But don’t you
recognize it? It’s painted and the muffler’s switched out, -but this was
my dad’s.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Ten years. A little dried out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: First off, that woman. We didn’t go all the
way, you know?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Yeah? Okay, so?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You think technically I’m still a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Were you inside her?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: It counts. Next. …What?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I been havin’ this weird dream. The thing is,
I think maybe the dream’s real. Forget it. No way I’m tellin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You know enough of my secrets to get me
shot. Sharon’s mom on Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream is there you
can’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s about part of me gettin’ smaller. An
important part.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You have gotta’ be fuckin’ kiddin’ me.
You’re not thirteen!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Screw you. Maybe I caught something.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I think it’s good you bought this truck.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can do the gasket for twenty bucks. But new
T-sprocks, for this thing? Two, three hundred, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Shit. Can I hold off on that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No skin off my ass. But a few days, weeks, your
whole transmission could blow.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Ah, Jeez. I shouldn’t got this.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Four hundred seventy-five horsepower.
Twenty-eight inch wheels. It’s a classic. Let me dig around out back.
Maybe we got a used set.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That’d be great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s not my wrench. It’s my truck.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple
T-sprocks. The flanges are sheared off. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You have to watch my brother, Max. He’s
sellin’ you “T-sprocks?”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: There’s no such thing. Last week he sold
Mrs. Gustafson a whole set: six hundred bucks. My name’s Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: From New York. Poli-Sci transfer. I sort of
asked around campus.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’ve prob’ly already got a stalker, huh?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You heard about Cafe Lunizia? Italian? They
got New York style pizza. Make you feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You askin’ me out?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, well, uh, -definitely!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Hey, Spanky, let’s go! Look forward to kickin’
your puck ass.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: My ride.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Your name’s “Spanky?”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, Puck Ass, but people just call me Luke.
We’re beatin’ his frat boy team in street hockey. Pisses ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’ll talk to Max. Tell him to just replace
the gasket.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks. So, what do you think? I’ll just sit
there while you eat. I won’t even talk.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Look, I just split up with this total
amoeba.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, I’m a paramecium. That’s way more evolved.
I’m practically pond scum.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Maybe I’ll give you a call when the
truck’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Great. You mean to go out, right?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Whoa. That was her! Jesus, you’re sweatin’
like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We’re goin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look! My chest!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I had hair. Come on! Not a lot, but you’ve
seen me -some- right?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Okay, I don’t know. So?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, where’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I really thought you gettin’ laid was gonna’
help. What is it with you, man? I mean, you’re smarter than me, you’re
better lookin’ than me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I am not.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I know. But I’m just sayin’, you can get any
girl you want.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Easy for you, you’ve got Janine.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’m still workin’ on my GED. How long you
think Brainiac’s gonna’ wanna’ hang with that?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: She worships you.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Man, I’m gonna’ be that wild fling she had
with the local dude from the bike shop. “God, what was his name?”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You’re gonna’ have a great time with her
tonight. Just be yourself. …Mostly.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I caught him with my best friend. Former.
Such a cliche’.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Winthrop Hawkins. “Hawk.” From this Park
Avenue family. He’d know what kind of mushrooms those are, what the best
wine is.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The best wine is beer.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’m such a moron.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No, I am. I have incontrovertible
proof.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s a hawk. Get it? “Hawkins?” See,
you’re smirking!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And it’s GREEN! That’s the one color
tattoo they can’t REMOVE!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh. Bummer.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’m considering a prosthetic foot.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothin’. Maybe just kind a’ hot out here. You
want moron? When my dad died, -it’s okay, I was nine. I barely knew what
was goin’ on- But I thought the tombstone was really sad looking, so I
painted smiley faces and fish all over it.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: That’s sweet.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure dad would’ve loved that.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: So, what do you think makes a good
relationship?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: For real? I don’t know. Friendship. Great sex.
Knowing you want to be there even when it gets scary or bloody.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Whoa. Where’d that come from?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No, it’s just not the usual guy thing.
…You’re great, you know?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you excuse me a sec’?</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot</strong>: By the dumpster, Luke reaches
behind his head, WHIPS off his jacket and shirt, and looks down…</p>
<p><strong>first waiter</strong>: Table twenty-nine. Like to bring her
the cannoli special.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Oh yes! Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Lie down for me, baby!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: We takin’ up boxing?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t know. I am.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What’s goin’ on? You competin’ for
Mr. Universe this week?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Everyone should just mind their own fucking
business!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Didn’t go so great, huh?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It was goin’ great. She’s amazing. Funny. And
really smart. And the way she eats ravioli, like ‘aah.’</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Then I started feelin’ all weird again, and,…
oh, man, you’ll think I’m nuts… Keen, I had breasts. I felt ’em.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Whoa, first date. Definitely the ‘new
Luke!’</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! On me.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You’re startin’ to creep me out. Listen, I
think I know what’s goin’ on, okay? “Acute Adolescent Anxiety.” It’s
from the stress of college, girls, grades. It’s really common.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m not an adolescent. Where’d you get this
crap?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: The Net. I found all the symptoms right off:
panic attacks, “Localized Alopecia” -that’s hair loss. This doctor wrote
back, “Any chance your friend, Luke, just lost his virginity?”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You told, -you gave him my name?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: He’s a doctor, back East. He’s sending this
information pack. Look, I started thinkin’ you’re goin’ bipolar on me or
somethin’. Come on, man, BREASTS?!</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban house - morning</strong>: Luke hops down from
the truck cab, fixes his shirt and hair, trying to look nonchalant as he
rings the doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch, stay the hell away from my
sister!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You don’t say a word?! You just leave her
sittin’ there?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I came to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get out a’ here! She’s not home, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you tell her I came by?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. She’s honest with you, so you bolt? And
then what, you wake up feelin’ sorry for her?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! Is that what she thinks? I left ‘cause a’
what she said? That’s crazy! She’s like the most incredible girl I ever
met!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I had this ‘pasta quattro funghi’ - four
mushroom. It took me a while to even figure it out, but I think someone
put shrooms in it, or somehow they got in there by mistake. I was
hallucinating and everything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Amazes even me, a guy’s capacity to be a
world-class asshole. Fortunately, I’m familiar with the cause.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you please just tell her I came by?
Forget it. I’ll catch up with her on my own.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look, I’m gonna’ see her again, -if she’ll see
me. I don’t care what the fuck you say about it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, really.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You get near her, I’ll feed your nuts to the
neighbor’s dog!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What kind a’ dog is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m crazy about her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shrooms, huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll tell her you came by.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Had a sudden intense craving for a cherry
popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You can check in that freezer.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: What a relief. I’m Sydney. You?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Luke.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Workin’ late, huh? Luke?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, four AM. It sucks.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Why in the world do guys say “it sucks” as
if it were a bad thing? I mean, every guy’s dying to get a blow job,
right? So, you think they’d treat those words with profound respect,
like holy scripture. “What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn’t it
just SUCK?,”… “You won an Olympic Gold Medal?!, that BLOWS!”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: It must be great at your age. That river of
testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! How
about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic Gold?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No thanks. Jeez, lady.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I ought to dye my hair. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Uh, I don’t know. Looks fine.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Your hair is such an incredible color.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s brown.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I love it. Do you think I could cut just a
little piece? Match the color? It really “sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nah, c’mon. You’re messin’ with me.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I’m not. I love it. You really should get
rid a’ that thing, anyway. I have clippers in my bag.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Cowlick. Right here. See? I can just snip it
off.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: What’s the matter? Don’t you like being
touched? Don’t you like being a guy?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. I mean,… What? Sorry, but you’re just
bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: May be. But I learned long ago, you can’t
change your true nature, even if it can change you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Holy shit. It’s that lady from the store! Grey
and black at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: That boy, Keenan, still giving you
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Actually, I tried exactly what you said.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Unbelievable! Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Works every time. Nice to meet you, darling.
I hope you’ll find not too many rules here, and the drinks not too
dear.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yeah, thanks. It’s amazing.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Isn’t she great? Guys drive across the state
just to buy a beer from her. Total loner, though. No one’s ever seen her
with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What did she tell you to try?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, God. She’s eyeing you. I think she’s
comin’ over.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Can I buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Uh, no thanks. We’re already here with dates
and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You are? Who? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: They’re around somehwere.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Luke, if you like this girl, we better
talk.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Anything happen since we last spoke? Hot
flashes? Pressure in your chest?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Dr. Sydney Catchadourian. Keenan, right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You know him?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: We exchanged E-mail. I came right away.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: From Philadelphia? Why?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Your friend here has an extra
chromosome.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Someone put mushrooms in my mushroom
sauce.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I tested your hair.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re like some whack job. Get the hell away
from me.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Denial, denial, denial. Always the first
step. Keep him away from that girl.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What’re you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Chromosomes. Most people have forty-six: Two
X if you’re a girl, an X and Y if you’re a guy. He’s got forty seven: An
X, a Y, and a</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: We’ve only been together six months. And
he’s such a guy’s guy, everyone’s buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six
months in “Juvey.”</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Wild past, huh?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I think the only reason he’s even alive
right now, is okay, partly ’cause he’s so damn smart, but mostly ’cause
there’s this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won’t
bale on him.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. He doesn’t trust me at all. Luke. He’s a
rock.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: So, yes, you can trust him. I’m hoping
Keenan’s the same way. ’Cause believe me, I’m not used to rocks, I’m
used to pebbles.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Grains of sand.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Sure. I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: That lady’s nuts.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Another round?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Please. You see that couple over there? I
don’t get it. What’s he see in her?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: The brunette? You kiddin’? I’d give my left
one to be with her.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Yeah? So could he.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Your friends sorta’ like each other,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Super-glue. Thirty seconds together, you can’t
pull ’em apart.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: How’d they meet?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Keenan sold her a bike. I don’t think they’ve
been apart more than six hours since.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I never thought in a million years you’d go
out with me, let alone twice.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You’re not s’posed to say that. That’s a
total pathetic, loser thing to say. But I’m gonna’ take it as a huge
compliment.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Okay, two word answers only. Why’d you ask
me out in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Beautiful. Unpretentious. Why’d you say
‘yes?’</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Gentle.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: …Hot. Deep. Three words.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Okay, two words. What’re you most passionate
about?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Friendship. Trust. You?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hockey. …Hockey.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: So much for “deep.”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Okay, I’m gonna’ take a wild shot. Ricochet
off the back, over here, then straight into that side pocket. What are
my chances?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Point zero zero zero one.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Damn. Will you look at that tonsil
hockey?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I’d prefer not. This could get bad.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: You’ve been staring at him all night. You
got a thing for him, or what?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Actually, I’m hoping he’s got one for
me.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Looks like you two are gettin’ on okay.
Should we rack up another game?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Definitely! I’d like to get good at this
pool thing.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Okay, I’m gonna’ break this wide open!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Go for it!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: God. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Man, I’d be on the floor cryin’ like a
baby.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Would you excuse me a sec’?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Jeremy! Bourbon. Fast! Better give me the
whole bottle.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I mean, it was like a precision- guided
missile.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Uh- ah-</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’ll get some ice.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s-! Look!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I was afraid a’ this! Make sure no one gets
in!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Now, will you listen to me?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, GOD!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: It’s gonna’ come back. Drink this!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’re you givin’ me?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Valium. Flexeril. And a shitload of Darvon.
You gotta’ calm down.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: “Caaalm Down?!!!!!!”</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What’s wrong with him?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: He’s a Zerophiliac.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: A what?! I’m gettin’ a doctor! This isn’t
right!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I am a doctor! You breathe one word, anyone
else sees him like this, and he’s fucked! Pictures all over the net,
tabloids, television!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: No! We’re gonna’ get it back! You let me
help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life. Now, you his
friend or not?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Hang onto him. So he doesn’t get hurt when
he passes out.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Now just wait a sec’? Is it</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: There are no recorded incidents of
transmission from physical contact.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: “Recorded incidents?!!”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, PLEASE God! What did I DO</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Nothing. You’re a Z.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: “RECORDED INCIDENTS?!” Oh my God, I used his
deodorant!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Oh, will you calm down?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: He’ll be alright. He didn’t go all the way.
When you fall asleep or pass out, a Z almost always reverts back. It’s
called a Nocturnal Remission.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Oh, relax, it’s not contagious.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: In the world? A hundred. A thousand. There’s
no way to know. It doesn’t show up in any normal DNA test. It’s
triggered when you first have sex.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The woman in the RV!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: From Utah.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Now, you’re Morphescent whenever you’re
aroused.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You tellin’ me this is gonna’ happen any
time he gets the hots for a girl?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Man, this could be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Is there a cure?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: It’s not a disease! But there are steps you
can take.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, what are they?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Take it easy. You can’t rush this. Before
anything, you need to try going all the way.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: “All the way?”</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You need to turn all the way into a
female.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You out of your mind?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You have to give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Maybe we should get a second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, may be! ’Cause you can</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Fine, but I warn you, they’ve never seen
this before. First, they’ll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications,
surgery, electroshock therapy, -god knows what.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: If he were to try goin’ all the way, then
what?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’m just askin’.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It ain’t gonna’ happen!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Oh, for Chris’ sake! I’m trying to help you.
That Z chromosome’s not latent anymore! You don’t get control a’ that
thing, you don’t know when it’s going to kick in, what it’s gonna’ do!
You want to end up with three left breasts, behemoth hips and one
testicle?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Now, there’s no reason for that to happen.
Sorry. You’re not the only one who didn’t get any sleep. Now, are you
going to let me help, or not?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: How would he even do that? Go all the way, I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: He’s a Z. You become Morphescent when you
get turned on. You can change all the way when you have an orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I’m available.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this stage,
you don’t really need anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: It’s a lot to absorb, I know. When you’re
ready, give me a call. Your first time, you shouldn’t be alone.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Michelle. And I really like her, dad.
But,…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You know, I always thought your dying was the
worst thing that ever happened to me, and that happened more to you than
it did to me… I mean, a lot more, really.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Look, every day I wish you were around, but I
swear, if I tell you this, you damn well better stay dead!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And I swear to God I’m gonna’ beat this thing.
No matter what it takes. Before I tell you, I just want to make sure you
know that, okay?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I think I might be a Zerophiliac.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m not doin’ it. I don’t care what she says!
I can control this thing.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I didn’t know what was goin’ on before. I do
now, so, it’s not gonna’ be a problem. I just need to stay focused!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You mean, keep yourself from getting turned
on? How’re you gonna’ do that? You get turned on by two scoops of ice
cream.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’m just sayin’. I mean, you think Larissa,
the horse-faced girl’s got her good points.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I knew we’d find ’em here.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: We just wanted to know if you’re alright.
After last night.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine. Thanks. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I had a really good.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you excuse me a sec’?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What is goin’ on?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: We just need to be alone. We got a big game
tomorrow. Sometimes guys just need to hang with the guys, you know? No
distractions?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: C’mon, Michelle. Let the boys play with
their pucks.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You TOLD HER?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I had to. You know Janine. She knew
somethin’ was up.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’ve read about this kinda’ thing, but I
didn’t think it was real. It’s so cool!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: How can you say that? If I had a chance to
be a guy for a day, I’d jump at it. Seriously, Keen, wouldn’t you want
to get inside a girl’s body?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Don’t EVEN go there! Fine. You’re boys.
Still, isn’t it every guy’s dream to have a pair of boobs to play with
anytime he wants?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Not my own! Man, how could you tell her?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: She should be here. It’s just weird, two
guys alone, one turnin’ into a girl.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Yeah, I can’t wait. Not exactly something
you get to see every day.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Forget it!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What, HE gets to, and I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No one gets to!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Should we put on some soft music?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You want a magazine in there?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: How ’bout a couple beers?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Maybe you want to take a bath?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Will you PLEASE shut up?!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Does he sound different?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Think so.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh God! Oh, my God! Oh my GAWD!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Luke? You alright?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Dude.</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Happened fast, huh?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Can we see?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Come on. It’s not like I haven’t seen you
naked a hundred times. And she’s a girl!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Dude. Of course they’re perfect. I couldn’t
have tits like that?</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Oh, God. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You’re really hot. Victoria’s Secret
hot.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Latvian Lesbians’ Hidden Camera Chronicles.
Don’t look at me, -it’s your tape.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Look, I just wanna’ get one thing straight.
No way I’m gonna’ sleep with you.</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Man, even as a joke, that’s just</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I will. I’m definitely not into the butch
hair thing, though. You gotta’ do something about that.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I thought you’re into watchin’ two
girls?</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: This is too weird. This is freaking me
out.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Should we call Dr. Catchadourian?</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: What for? I did it. Now, I can switch
back. Get outta’ here.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Already?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Yeah, okay, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Will you stop starin’?!</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Janine? It’s like I can’t get in the
right mood or something.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Welcome to my world. Oh, honey, no one could
in this situation.</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: You gotta’ help. I need to do this
right now!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You can’t force these things.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Some girls go half their lives before they
even have one.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Okay, Studly, what do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: She likes it when I tell her stuff.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: “You’re so beautiful,” “I love your smile,”
“The English Patient was my favorite movie too.”</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Who’s that?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Pizza! Figured you’ll want some after.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I was lookin’ for Luke.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Hey, man. He’s not around right now. What’s
up?</p>
<p><strong>female luke</strong>: Thank God. I’m starving!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How ya’ doin’?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m Max. You live here too?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. She’s just visiting.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: She’s Luke’s cousin.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Luca.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I always thought “Luca” was a guy’s name?
Italian or something.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m part Italian.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Cool. I’m part Italian too. The important part.
Lei sono una bella donna. Amerei per mostrarlo il che inclinando torre
di pisa.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You in town for a while?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No, just a few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: ‘Weeks?!’</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Days.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m leaving today! Now!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Is there anything you want me to tell
Luke?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m way into hockey. I was hopin’ Luke could
show me the ropes. Is he as awesome as I’ve heard?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Yeah. He’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you play?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Uh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: She’s gotta’ pack. You need to go.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What is it? What’s the matter? Oh…</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: “Oh” what? What do you mean, “oh?”</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: He’s a hunk.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I got to switch back. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Get out of here! Just GET OUT!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s a girl thing.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Does he need any help in there?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Not from you.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: This is good!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Alright, okay, now open those little levers
on the sides,… and flip that center thingy back…</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Did you get this thing at the mall?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Janine wouldn’t have one a’ those.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Please. And mine’s got way more features
than that one. Or that one.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: So, where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It was Larissa’s. My roommate.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’m just sayin’, he’s not that experienced
with girls.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, and you are?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’m startin’ to wonder if you are?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I’m not gonna’ feed your fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Luca?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Don’t call me that!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You gotta’ just think about whatever turns
you on. No matter what it is.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Okay, pretend you’re thrown on your back,
pinned against the bed…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You can’t move an arm, a leg, nothing, even
an inch!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: And two strong hands feel your thighs,…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: creeping firmly, slowly toward your
breasts…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Keen!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Babe, every time I look at you, I get the
shivers! I just want to rip your clothes off, and throw you down…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, Keen!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I want to envelop every inch of you, that
incredible curve along your side,…</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I want to pin your arms over your head, and
make mad, passionate…</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: You’re a screamer.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Didn’t want anyone around. So, I did what you
said.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Amazing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Weird. Awful.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Hmm. Was it difficult making the switch?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. It was hard gettin’ back. I need an
owner’s manual.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: A lot of guys could use one of those.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So, what now? Do I take pills or
something?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: No, it doesn’t work like that. This may
sound odd, but I need to know if you’re attracted to me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What? No.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Hmm. You’re not gay, are you?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: NO! Jeez! I’m just not attracted to you like
that.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Okay, calm down. This could be a problem.
Right now, you can go either way anytime you want. It’s a very special
and critical time for a Z, something you’ll experience only once in
life.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You need to use this incredible opportunity
you’ve been given, to figure out which you’re supposed to be: male or
female.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Don’t you see? You get to choose.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t want to choose. I want to be a
guy.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your
desires can conflict with your desires. It’s important to know for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Believe me, I know.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I think you need to try again.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Why’re you so resistant? If the truth is,
you want to be a guy, great, but if not…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Don’t even say that!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Well, clearly some part of you feels
differently. You couldn’t change if you didn’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What?! That’s crap!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: That’s the thing about the truth. It’ll set
you free, but first it can really piss you off.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: This is nuts! I’m supposed to be a guy!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Then what’s the problem? You are one.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re not gonna’ help?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I will, the moment you’re ready to try
again. You can come back to my place right now if you want.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Forget it!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Well, ain’t we a basket a’ biscuits?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yeah, Luke, what got into you today?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The Force.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey. Good game.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I dropped by your place. Any chance you could
give me a few pointers.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re awesome out there. And according to my
sister, you walk on water.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Truth is, I uh, met your cousin. Luca.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh. Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You both have practically the same name?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: We were both named after our Uncle.
Locasto.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, she’s cool. Actually, she’s hot. I was
hopin’ maybe you could hook me up.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Huh? No. Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! She just wouldn’t be interested!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She a Lesbian?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! Of course not. Jesus! She’s, -my
cousin!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, okay. So? Michelle’s my sister. You
gonna’ tell me you wouldn’t like to do her?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: FUCK YOU, man!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is your deal?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You ASSHOLE!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Keep the fuck away from me! And Michelle
too!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You can fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: What the hell’s goin’ on?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Luke’s datin’ his sister.</p>
<p><strong>various guys</strong>: Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh, you can all fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: This shirt? I’ve had it for years.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Well, it’s very sexy. I love men’s clothes.
What else have you got in your closet?</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Polly, are you alright? Didn’t mean to walk
in on you.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Oh, hon. I’m fine, thanks. Love, tears.
That’s the trade-off.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: My God, he’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Yes, he’s a Michelangelo. And the sweetest
boy in the world. Sorry, darling, I’m afraid you’ll find he’s not your
type.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Oh, we’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: I think he may prefer men.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I certainly hope so.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You two better have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Is Luke alright?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: He should have full control over this now.
Something must be really confusing him. The only thing I can think
of…</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: When he became Luca, was he attracted to one
of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Well, he sure as hell wasn’t attracted to
me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: No. Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Wasn’t it just the two of you?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, give me a break! No way! Max?! They just
had a huge fight. He tried to beat the crap out of him!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, Christ, Luke’s not queer! He was just
turnin’ into a girl!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Exactly. He was a girl.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh! This is just wrong.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Would you rather she was attracted to
me?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Would you?!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Maybe I would!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke needs your
help. He needs to know you’re behind him, no matter what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: So, what’s all this mean?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Bottom line? Maybe Luca really likes this
boy, -enough to want to be female.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Don’t sneer!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, come on! I know the guy. We’ve done all
kinds a’ shit together: Hoops, hockey!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, and girls can’t play sports?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine! Why the hell
would he want to be a girl?!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: That’s so hard to imagine?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Uh, -YEAH!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I’m talking
about. You see this?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Who’s he? An Ex? …Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Ex me.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You’re one too? You’re a Z? You’re a
guy?!</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Was. I made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: And once you finally figure out who you are,
it’s a horrible thing not being yourself. That’s why it’s crucial we
help Luke.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You musta’ worked out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s this all about?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: It’s just a little something we thought you
might want.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What the hell is this for?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I told her. I told ya’. What a stupid ass
idea!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Keen! Don’t! We just want you to know,
whatever you decide, it’s all right with us.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Decide?! WHAT?! No, it’s not! Get this thing
away from me! JUDAS</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Sorry, man. Think she wishes everyone was
female.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What’s that s’posed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he doesn’t want
to be girl! Like he’d have to think about THAT!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: There happen to be millions of us out there
that like being female!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, bully for YOU!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: NO! I want to know! Just exactly what’s
wrong with being a girl?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Nothin’! It’s great! It’s fuckin’ PHENOMENAL,
if you happen to BE one!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Maybe we should’ve had this conversation the
other afternoon?!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That wasn’t my choice!</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I sure as hell didn’t make you do it!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Janine, will you just let me talk to him for
a sec’?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Oh, what?! It’s a ‘GUY THING?!’ Give me a
fuckin’ break!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Sorry, man. She talked me into it. You know
Janine.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Look, uh,… you do like bein’ a dude,
right?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Asshole!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: You should thank me. The one she picked out
was PINK!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I’m okay. You?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Okay. You look really nice.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Thanks. I was hopin’ you might call.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I was going to.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: There’s something I need to talk to you
about. -But did I do something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. Nothin’ like that. There’s just some stuff
I’ve got to sort out.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: There’s nothing you can’t tell me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Me too. What did you want to talk to me
about?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Nothing really. So, heard you and Max
really got into it?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah. I kind a’ lost it.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: He knows how to push buttons, huh? What
exactly did he say that got you so pissed off?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I don’t know. We’d just finished a game. I was
all revved up.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: He’s actually a really nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Not sure he’s too crazy about me seein’ his
sister.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Did he scare you off?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, he doesn’t “scare” me. What, his struttin’
around, thinkin’ he’s such a bad ass, with his shirt hangin’ open half
the time?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: It’s just an act. He likes pretending he’s
Joe Cool. Always says you gotta’ just be whatever you want, and fuck ’em
if they can’t take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Well, he’s a joke alright.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Look, I’m not sure this is gonna’ work
out.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No. I can’t do this. I’m not sure you even
know who you are. Much less who I am. Have you ever even had a
girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Well, if you think my brother’s such a
“joke,” how much better could you think of me? We’re not that different,
you know?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re totally different. He’s a guy, for
one.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And he’s my best friend. If you don’t like
him, you can’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: “I wanna know how to go To the inside of
love. I can’t find my way through.”</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: “I’m outside of love, To the side or
above, I can’t find my way with you”</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: “Must be a special view, Finding a me with a
you, On the inside of love.”</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Oh, honey. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You’re one too. Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I didn’t want to confuse the issue.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So, it’s true what you said? You really know.
I wouldn’t change unless I wanted to?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Maybe some part of you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What part? How much of me? I mean, for it to
work? Half? More than half? What if it was only a tiny bit, -a
thought?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I don’t know. But I believe there may be
thousands of Z’s out there, millions for all we know, go their whole
lives without even knowing they are one. Nothing ever happens. You
couldn’t keep it from happening.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I love being with Michelle. How come I can’t
control it when she’s around?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I think whatever part of yourself you deny,
just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You think I don’t really want to be a man.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: I think for some, making it stop is more
important than knowing who you are. It was for me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Maybe for me too.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Right now, you’re Morphescent. The key is to
have sex with another Z. You become Adulmorphic. Your gender locks. You
can’t just change anytime you want.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Another Z?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: That’s why I came all the way out here.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And why you keep tryin’ to get me in the
sack?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Thought maybe I could save you some
distress. But you say you’re not attracted to me. For it to work, both
of us have to be into it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That won’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Not right now? Okay. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Remember that Christmas when Keen and me
accidentally set the Scofields’ house on fire?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: And that burning shingle drifted over and lit
up the Robertson’s place? The whole town was ready to lynch us, and we
snuck back home… Two AM, you were up drinkin’ coffee,…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I thought you were gonna’ kill us. But you
just looked me right in the eye, and said, “Son, there’s leftover pizza
in the fridge.”</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: That was the coolest thing anyone ever said.
Dad, I’m in such trouble.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I feel like if I let this thing in, it’s all
over. But I don’t know what else to do. Guess you can’t figure out who
you are, until you accept who you might be.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re about the last person I expected to
see.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I can show you a few moves if you want?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah? What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re better than Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I taught him everything he knows.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I thought you left town?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Had to come back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Where’d you learn to speak Italian?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just tourist stuff. “I’ll have the spaghetti
bolognese.” “How much for a room?”</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Have you been?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Little Italy. In New York. Someday, though.
Want to go with me?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Look, this was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. Of course. I know.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Oh, Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are you and he…?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s really none of my business.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: No! I’m sorry. I shouldn’t’ve come here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please don’t say you’re “just visiting.” That
you “need to leave.” I’m the one who needs to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lumber mill - dusk</strong>: The Semi Truck is parked
alone in the middle of the asphalt. From inside the cab, the blue dress
flips over the rolled down window.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I mean, what the FUCK is goin’ on?! You do
wanna’ be a girl? You’re into guys now?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No! I don’t know exactly. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What about Michelle?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I had to be sure. I am now. Come on, it’s sort
of a Catch-22. I make out with a girl, I start turning into one. You
gotta’ admit, it’s a little weird, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Let’s get outta’ here. You want a ride
somewhere? Janine’s?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Why don’t you go see her? Think you’re more
her type.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I’ll see ya’ round, okay?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: “See me around?”</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Look, I’m gonna’ find my own place, okay?
This is gettin’ too fuckin’ weird for me.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I’m goin’ to Dr. Catchadourian’s tonight. To
make this stop.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I don’t care. I’ve had it with all this
crap. I mean, you gonna’ start hittin’ on me next?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Yeah, that’s right Keenan, you and me: let’s
do it.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I guess I really did need to face it head on
in order to see.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: It was courageous.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Girls, are just, I don’t know. It’s a
different energy. They’re soft and warm, they can make a guy feel
complete.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: And multiple o’s. Actually, male Z’s have
multiple o’s too. Been so long I nearly forgot.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Okay, to be honest, I’m relieved you sorted
this out. My conscience would have bothered me for decades if we’d just
gone ahead without you being certain.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: To womanhood!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: To manhood!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: So, how does this work?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: We just do it. And, …it just happens.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Do you like this dress?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sure. Looks great on you. Man, dresses! Even
without everything else, dresses are reason enough right there to stay a
guy.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: “Stay a guy?” Let me get this straight. You
didn’t decide to be a woman?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No. Of course not. What?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Just testing you. Hold on a moment. There’s
something I forgot…</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: You’ve never done it with another Z. Trust
me, you need to be tied down.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: On the contrary.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Just let yourself go completely.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Wow, this is intense.</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: When two Z’s do it, the lateral hypothalamus
gets completely overwhelmed,…</p>
<p><strong>sydney</strong>: Cellular fission kicks in, and, well,… you
can go Zytusional!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Oh no. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>half-luca</strong>: What have you done?!</p>
<p><strong>luca/luke and sydney</strong>: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: I hear you’re the best. Yes, it’s an
emergency! Please. Or I’ll have to cut it myself. Now, you look me in
the eye, and tell me that wasn’t the best sex you ever had.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Half an hour! YES! THANK you!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: You can have all my clothes. Oh, and I
just bought these incredible Anna Felucci pumps. Maybe I should keep
those.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Okay, I wasn’t completely honest with
you, but I never lied either. It stopped. That is what you wanted.
You’re Adulmorphic now. The only way to switch is to do it with another
Z.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: I know you don’t believe me, but this
is the right thing for you. Eventually, you’ll figure that on your own.
But I could tell it was just gonna’ take way too long!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Oh, for Chris’ sake. Being a woman
doesn’t make you any less of a man!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Damnit! I can’t live my whole LIFE
wrong ‘cause of one stupid mistake! I’m a man! I love havin’ this chest,
these arms! But most of all,… Welcome home, boys! Hang in there, I’m
takin’ you out for a SPIN!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What’s goin’ on? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Whoa. I guess I really didn’t think you were
gonna’ go this way. Okay. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Hang on a sec’. Look, I’m sorry about
earlier, -what I said. But all this stuff. Janine and I split up.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: All I ever did was piss her off. I’m not
sure she even wants a guy. And you think I’m so much better with girls
than you, and sure I can get laid anytime I want, but truth is, I never
even woulda’ hit on her if it weren’t for watchin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: The way you just talk to ‘em about anything,
like it was okay. I gotta’ get her back, man.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: It’s like the whole world’s blown apart. Ah,
shit. Man, you havin’ tits now is just weird.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Janine said he’s definitely there.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Did she mention me?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Women. God, I’m glad you want to be a guy.
You are absolutely sure, right?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: ’Cause it really is totally cool either
way.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m SURE.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Okay, I just don’t want you to think I’m
zerophobic, or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: You’re on the wrestling team.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yeah. You catch the meets?</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Just an educated guess. Wanna’
wrestle?</p>
<p><strong>inside the semi</strong>: The truck CAREENS around a
CURVE.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Can’t this thing go any faster?!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: You know me better than anyone. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I mean, if I weren’t a hundred percent sure
which I’m s’posed to be. If you had to say.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: All I know is, every time you look at
Michelle, or think about her, you smile. What the hell else do you need
to know?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: It’s not right. She deserves to be with a
normal guy.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: So, you don’t get to be with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: That why they call it “zero- philia?”</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: She’s not gonna’ want some guy who thinks
maybe he’s supposed to be a girl sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: How do you know? Did you ask?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: No way I’m gonna’ ask her that.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Well, you have to. Where are your nads,
man?!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: We’ll get ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Come on, let’s grab a couple beers.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Of course, I see you brought your own
six-pack.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Jeez. She won’t even look at me.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: I do love to mess with Texas.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: We better get outta’ here.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Keenan?! It’s not the way it looks.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don’t care if
you’re queer. Trust me, around here, that’s nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch! We’re doin’ it again,
right now!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Jeez. She your wife?!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: No! She just said, she wants sex! I
can’t. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: “Sorry?!” Fuck you! FUCK ME!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: We’re goin’ inside right here!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: I’ll scream rape.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: So will I.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: But I’m gay!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: We both need to be into it, or nothing
happens.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Such bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: That’s why I became a woman in the
first place. I couldn’t handle it. Figured if I was female, it was okay
to like guys.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: She’s lyin’.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: You’re tellin’ me, ’cause you’re straight as a
girl and I’m straight as a guy, we can screw and switch, but…</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: ’cause you’re straight as a girl, and
I’m gay as a guy, even if we do it…</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m just screwed.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Jeez. You need trigonometry to figure this
thing out. Maybe you’re ‘bi.’</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: In my world the Kinsey scale’s
three-dimensional, but trust me, girls do nothing for me. Zilch! You, on
the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: What am I gonna’ do?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What if he’s lying? I say, do him again
anyway!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>male sydney</strong>: Fine. Waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: What does she think?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You asshole!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: I don’t believe this. You slept with that
guy?!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh, please! What about Max?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Don’t you care about him at all?!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Not like that: I’m straight! I’m attracted to
you!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh, who cares, you idiot! And sorry to
break it to you, but I’m straight too.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: No. This’ll sound crazy, but I’m not who you
think I am-</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who you
are!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: You know I’m a Zerophiliac?!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Yes! So you can just go fuck yourself.
-Literally!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Does Max know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: What if he does? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: He’s a guy!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And you’re a girl!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m not supposed to be!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: There’s no supposed to be anything, you
just ARE!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Is that what you think?! NO!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Well, then congratulations! You’re a guy,
just like every other guy I ever met! I can’t believe you slept with
him!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: He was a woman! I was tricked. I didn’t know
I’d switch.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: You’re gonna’ tell me he’s a Z too?! Both
of you?!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Well, that’s just perfect. What, is there
something in the water around here?!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: She told me it would make it stop. That it
would keep me from turning into a girl.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: So what?! Why’s that so important to you?!
There’s no way this was gonna’ work.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Because I’m a Zerophiliac.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Because you can’t stand being one! Bye,
Luca.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Luke.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: What’s it like? To really make love?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: The best part’s just lyin’ there after.
Really close, really far away.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Like goin’ to the moon, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Yeah. …They should open a pizza joint up
there.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: What am I gonna’ do?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: Maybe being a woman’ll turn out okay. Like
being an elevated member of the male species.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Elevated “member?”</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I just mean, maybe he’ll learn to like
it.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: As hard as that is to conceive!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Shut up! Both of you! What, you want a written
guarantee? You’re so damn lucky! You’re into him, he’s into you.
Super-glue! What the hell else do you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>keenan</strong>: I think you’re the female half of me.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: I think you’re the macho half of me.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: And I don’t know what half of who the hell I
am.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: What are you gonna’ do?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I don’t know. I prefer being a guy, but I’m a
girl? I’m attracted to Max, but I’m in love with Michelle? It’s like I’m
s’posed to be both.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Not too practical. But at least now I
know.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Girl trouble? Boy trouble?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: How about we get a game in before dawn?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s the point? It never works out. Or they
just cheat on you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when I was
your age. A boulevard of broken hearts. But eventually, I found him.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Scratch. Then he died.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Everything reminded me of him. So, I came
here, half way round the world to forget. Then created this place, just
like the one where we met.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He can’t handle this. Us. He can’t handle who
he is.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: You being a guy too?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or him being a girl.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Everyone’s terrified. But once you really
know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No one wants to know who I really am.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: You’re so sure?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s impossible. He was the one person I
thought could understand. But no, it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: It’s worth finding out.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I know she doesn’t want to talk to me. But do
you know where I can find her?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: New York. Left two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Oh, man. …You’re staying?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just ’til Friday.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I wanted to apologize to her. Forget it, I
don’t know,… Obviously, nothing’s gonna’ ever be with me and her, but I
just wish she knew how much I, -and that I wasn’t cheating, I was just
trying to be a man for her. She’d have a field day with that one,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: If you talk to her, please just tell her, I’m
sorry, and I wish her the best,… everything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I’m sorry. To you too.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Mixed signals, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ow! Son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stepped on a nail. Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, you gettin’ used to this at all?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: I wish.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You definitely had me confused.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: For whatever it’s worth. I think you’re a

<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks. But you’re not interested?</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Truth is, I am. And I guess it sounds crazy,
but I couldn’t do that to Michelle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: For whatever it’s worth, I think you’re pretty
hot too.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Too bad you’re a moron.</p>
<p><strong>luca</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have incontrovertible proof.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Hey you. …Good morning. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: You still think I’m going to bolt, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: And leave me stuck.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: What do you want, a gender pre-nup?</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: Maybe. I have to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Only place I’m going is back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>michelle</strong>: No. I can’t show up at work like this.</p>
