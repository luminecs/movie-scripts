<p><strong>gene pitney</strong>: “When your young and so in love as we
and bewildered by the world we see why do people hurt us so Only those
in love know What a town without pity can do If we stop to gave upon a
star people talk about how bad we are ours is not an easy age we’re like
tigers in a cage What a town without pity can do”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff? Yeah, I’ll see you down there later. I
just gotta finish some stuff I’m writing. Okay. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: SOOZE? Yeah, so did you tell him that we
couldn’t afford twenty bucks a ticket and why didn’t he put us on the
comp list? No, no, there’s always a comp list. Alright. Well, so then,
just get your mother’s car and maybe we’ll all go do something. Yeah. I
gotta get off. Okay. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, Frankie! Hey, what are you doing?
Sleeping? What, at six o’clock? Sleep when you are dead. Hey, man, I
just got off work. Why don’t you meet me down at the corner. So? Put on
some clothes and come down, man, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I wanna see you, man.
Alright. Yeah. Hey, why don’t you bring that pot you just bought? What?!
Yeah, fuck you man! Later.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m going out later.</p>
<p><strong>sooze’s mom</strong>: No car.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: The fuck not?</p>
<p><strong>sooze’s mom</strong>: You know the fuck not.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sooze’s mom</strong>: Don’t swear it’s impolite.</p>
<p><strong>shopping channel host</strong>: … suggest that you call
immediately. We are truly thrilled to bring you this next item and it’s
a Host Value Special. It’s the spiral relaxation lamp. I personally
bought one of these for a very good friend of mine and ended up falling
in love with it, I found myself mesmerized by watching the balls. That’s
why I suggest that if you’re going to buy one, that you buy maybe two or
three…</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: It started with a traffic argument,
escalated to the firing of a legally carried handgun, ending with the
death of the man it was aimed at. GORDON RIEDHALE claimed he couldn’t
escape an attacker who was punching him in the head. Concealed carry
instructors say, “It’s that fear…”</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Just depends on the filter capacity. What size
is that pool?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Fifty-five thousand. Marlboros, chief. Hard
pack.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: In that case you need a heavy-duty filter.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Two-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Two-fifty? They go up?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Always two-fifty, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: What that means is that every armed
licensee faced with danger must make a split second judgment call.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Timmy-boy!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Peace! Ah, time’s running out, three, two,
one!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Score! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Seven-twenty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I gave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: He paid you man.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: You owe me twenty cents. Come on,
seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Here’s twenty-five cents.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Guy should cut down on his caffeine
intake.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Needs some pizza in his diet.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I don’t think I like that guy’s attitude at
all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I’m gonna break
your fucking legs. Take ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You’re fascist, man. Neofascist.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Buff, sit. You know what I mean though?
Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, well, he’s from a Third World country.
He doesn’t have it easy.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What? What the fuck do you know about the third
world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines
in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It’s true, there’s no,
you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they
think it’s gonna be the same.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, he’s a human being you can give him that
much.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy
is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of
four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh yeah? Oh, how’d you ship it over there,
man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it’d be way cold and
coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, that slice is the difference between
life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yo, your gettin’ me all upset here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You should get upset. Everyone should get
upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying,
“Don’t get me upset. Your bumming me out.” My duty as a human being is
to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the
first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now
we’re all gonna be dead and there’ll be new people standing here
drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of
Oreos, and they won’t even know we were ever here. And then fifty years
after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there’ll be all
these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they’re doing on
this fucking planet and they’ll all be full of shit. It’s all so fucking
futile.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: If it’s all so fucking futile, what the fuck
are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Because I’m alienated.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! Hey, you like orgasms? Oh, yeah! Oh, Hey,
hey, I’m at work yesterday, bitch comes in, orders a twelve-inch pie
with extra cheese. So I ask her if she wanted me, like, to carry that
out to her car for her. Bitch is obviously in heat. “Yes, right away.”
So I carry the pie out to her car. We smoke a J. She blows me. We eat
the pizza, I chase her with the beer. Smoke, babe, slice, brew. All four
bases, fuckin’ home run man!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by
your ability to lie.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks
ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, it’s me. No, that’s, that’s the ultimate
liar of liars.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: And your mom.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I’m here. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Where are you-hoo?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, no, no, I don’t wanna be stuck with
the guy. I want the tickets.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shut up! Aw…</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Look, you can’t be out here all night
tonight, okay?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, we’re just having a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: This is private property, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Come on man.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, don’t tell us about private property.
This is America, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay?
The customers complain.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: We’re your customers. We’re not
complaining.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You don’t need to sit next to me right
now.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Who were you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nobody. Sooze.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Stuck with what guy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You said you didn’t want to get stuck with
some guy. What guy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, uh, nobody. It’s, uh, it’s my birthday
this week and Sooze’s brother might come by to wish me a happy
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: It’s your birthday?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!</p>
<p><strong>buff and tim</strong>: Happy birthday! Happy fuckin’
birthday!</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Um, is Sooze around?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Uh, well, what’d she say? Is Pony
coming?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Want a beer? Is Pony coming?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: No, thanks. I don’t drink. Um, well, what’d
she say? I mean, did she talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Pony? What’s a “pony”? You mean that geek who
played the folk music at the senior prom? What’s that guy’s name? Neil
Moynihan?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, Pony’s band “Dream Girls”? Been on the
road opening for “Midnight Hore”. Stadiums, man. Wait, so Pony’s coming
by here?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Didn’t you see their video on MTV?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, I shot my TV.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: But, so, Pony’s comin’ by here to the
corner?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s around and, you know, maybe he’s coming
by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It’s no big deal.
Me, him, and Sooze are gonna…</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your
close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us
to, leave?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. We were just gonna go someplace or
something to…</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Alright. She told him to meet us here.
Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Pony’s coming here to the corner?!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, no, it wasn’t even my idea.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony,
you know, that’s, that’s fine with us.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sooze wants to see him.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I
gotta know what it’s like to be on MTV.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, we all want to see him. So when’s he
coming?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah, when’s he coming?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know. Later. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: God, I haven’t seen you all day.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You could’ve come over.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I know, I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh! Trim it!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sorry. Let’s go back to the van right now.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No. I’m not going to the van, it’s so gross.
Come on. I’m doing my performance right now.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, so maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Ow. Jesus. Fuck Oliver Stone. Fuck Bill
Clinton. Fuck Howard Stern. Fuck Michael Bolton. Fuck O.J. Simpson. Fuck
Pope John Paul. Fuck my dad. Fuck all the men. Fuck all the men. Fuck
all the men!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Bang your head, blow your nose. Run down the
street, suck a hose. Chew my lips, eat some shit. Eat a stick of
dynamite and blow yourself to bits. Shut your mouth, go away. Drink my
piss, have a nice day! I hope you cry and never doubt. I hope you die
with blood in your mouth. I hope your lies will no more shout What’s in
my eyes, what’s in your snout. Your a pig! I know that’s true! I dance a
jig! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: That was really great.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Was it okay?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What did you guys think?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Slides go with it.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Behind me. I’m making these slides out of
these old pictures and paintings and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Was that supposed to be me?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: It’s called “Burger Manifesto, Part One The
Dialectical Expression of Testosterone.” Isn’t that a great title?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Why is everything about you, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in
your life.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Man?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever
the fuck I am.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: It’s a piece.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Your sure as hell right about that.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It’s just
part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Ah, you know people there?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m just gonna go. I figure the worst I can
do is starve to death.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: “The worst I can do is starve to death.”
Listen to you.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I don’t want to hear it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing
your bags, you’re jumping into the unknown because some conceptual
artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis
and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you
have talent.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Mister Brooks has had shows in New York,
Jeff. He’s been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, well, then you better listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything!
Let’s just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yes, that’s right. You know what, honey? You
should go to New York. You should go. Go show ’em. They need your unique
point of view.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: At least I have a point of view, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I stand for something. And I’m trying to
communicate something.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are you trying to communicate? Tell
us.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: So you can give me more shit?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no. It’s an honest question. What are you
trying to communicate?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff.
You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Mn-hm.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: “Burger Manifesto, Part One” is gonna make
people think?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yes, you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: About things that are important to me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the
military industrial…</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Um-hm.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait. Racism? You don’t know anybody who’s
black!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Of course I do!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Name one.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: God, KAREN JOHNSON.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: One!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Your completely missing the point.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m talking about idealism.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Responsibility, progress.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, idealism is guilty, middle class
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, no. I’m not being cynical, I’m being
honest.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: But do you stand for anything?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes, I stand for -</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What? What do you stand for?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of
truth!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can I talk here? Let me talk.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You know, all you know is what’s good for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can I talk?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Typical male.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Typical male.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Typical male.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Typical male.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it’s a
good idea? Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Seriously? It’s a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons,
you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I’ve gained wisdom
and now I’m back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I can’t wait till Pony gets here, you know?
Have a conversation with a human being?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, if you love him so much, why didn’t you
go see him play?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Um, because you didn’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Like I’m going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil
Moynihan in some band that I helped start.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Okay. Well, you know, he’s always been a nice
guy and I like him.</p>
<p><strong>tim, buff, &amp; jeff</strong>: He’s a geek.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, I’ve been, uh, making these tapes,
videotapes. I ripped off a camcorder up at the mall. I thought, you
know, it could be something that I do, be a video artist, you know.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, Buff, the postmodern
idiot savant. He will outdo us all.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: It’s safe, come on.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: That’s it. That’s it! I’m calling the
police.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why we’re just standing here.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Look, your trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, call the cops! Call ’em, call ’em right
now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He’ll definitely take your
word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I’ll tell him
about how you sell beer to minors.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Look, look, I’m not joking around now, okay?
Come on, let’s go, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: We’re just standing here!</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Just go and stand someplace else, okay?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You stand someplace else, man. You stand
someplace else. This is our corner. You don’t fucking own it!</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Yes I do. My family owns it. It’s ours. You
don’t belong here.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No, you don’t belong here. We were here before
you.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Why don’t you go back to where you came
from?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Hey, Tim.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, see, sweetheart, you don’t want to stand up
for parasite ‘cause I can fuckin’ smell him from here. You know what?
Tow words, man: roll on.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, what are you, huh?
You fucking drunk bum. Yeah, you good-for-nothing. You just, uh, hang
around. On my property.</p>
<p><strong>time</strong>: The Hare Krishna’s calling me a drunk. Hey,
listen, pal, you want us to go?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Yeah, please, go. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Fucking drunk, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You have the largest penis. Can we go
please?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Don’t let ’em fight.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: The dude wants it.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: This is ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tim!</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Pakeesa? It’s okay. Come on. It’s okay. Come
on, they’re just joking around.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, we’re just screwing around. Like
Mohammed said. Can’t take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for
that, mama!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: We’re sorry, okay? We’re gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hey, your gonna regret this.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Come on, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Fuck her! Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jeff! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry about that. It was just a
misunderstanding. He was upset about something and he took it out on you
and I’m sorry. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I seriously doubt that Pony’s gonna be in
a limo.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: That’s the rock star thing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, I’ll bet you he has a babe with him right
out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud!
Oh!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You wanna bet he’s with a girl?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, he’s not with a girl.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it’s so
huge!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know what? He probably gets bored with all
that shit.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure
that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’d get bored.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I wouldn’t. If I were in his shoes, every
morning I’d get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed
by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot
coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I’d order my bodyguard to go find
my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria
Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I’d, like, have to chew off all her
clothes until she was completely nude. Except she’d have these amazing
dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold
peace signs hanging from ’em. And then she’d take out this half-ounce of
blow, we’d snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain
cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning
trashed watching Gilligan.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what
would you do in the afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing
the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an
occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy.
Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we’d watch Captain Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That sounds so depressing.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn’t love
it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I’m not saying that I wouldn’t love
it.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m saying no, I’m saying after a while it’d
wear thin.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Watch out for that tree.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: A long, long, long, long, while.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: A long, long, long…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, Tim! Hold up.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: It was a racial incident.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It was just something that got out of hand.
Did anyone get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: It got that close.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I
thought something really bad was going to happen, I would’ve done
something.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Okay, what would you have done.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I would’ve stopped it.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know. I would’ve done something. This
is kind of hypothetical, isn’t it? This place is so stupid. I can’t
believe we’re sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all
these people eating their chunks of dead flesh…</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jeff. Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: … like fucking robots. Look at those kids
there.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister
Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his
apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Sooze.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that I might have
some feelings about you moving to New York?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What feelings?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Us.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, see, that’s not what I’m saying. I
could go to New York if I wanted to, but what’s the point? So I can
learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead?
So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: So what do you wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No one does nothing, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, well, then, I’m gonna break new
ground.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: New ground?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Taking one community college course on the
history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don’t
need that. Why? What’s your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on
the cover of some glossy magazine?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: My goal is to make art.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So, what, why can’t you do that here? What’s
wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit
on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about
Burnfield?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: So I can spend the rest of my life guessing
what it would be like to be a real artist?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: So you and I can fuck while your parents are
out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and
me?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>scuff</strong>: Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook’s
ass, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?</p>
<p><strong>scuff</strong>: Just one?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>scuff</strong>: You seen the new guy we got? Beavers? The guy
can pass. Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Do you remember that game
against North Reading? When you passed to Pierce and he dropped the
ball? What do you think happened? Do you think, like, he wasn’t there or
were you short?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I don’t, I don’t remember. What do I owe
you?</p>
<p><strong>scuff</strong>: Uh, eleven twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: “In my head I’m tall My arms are big”</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Hey. Do you have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No I quit.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Hey, you said you did a video?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: It’s really not about anything.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Oh. Well, what’s it on?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: A cloud.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: A cloud?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped
it.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It
looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything,
you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I’m
gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with
the camera and tape shit.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Oh, that’s so amazing. I wish I could see
it.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You can see it. Whenever you want. Don’t you,
um, work at a hospital or something?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah, I’m a nurse’s aide at Mercy.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Your a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: No, I, you know, I help ’em out. I empty
bedpans and bring ’em lunch. That kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Any gunshot victims?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Oh, some of ’em. But it’s mostly just
strokes and shit. I mean, most of ’em just sleep all the time and get
kind of yellow. Usually they die id they’re, you know, really
yellow.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Sounds like a bummer.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Oh, no, it’s not. I mean, they’re not all
totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I’m helping them.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: I don’t know. Waiting, I guess. You
know?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Do you wanna go to the van?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: I don’t smoke dubes and I don’t really hang
out. But I’ll go back. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Okay, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hey, Pony.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Hey, man. Jeff. How’re you doin?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Good, man.</p>

<p><strong>erica</strong>: I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne
Rice.</p>

songs.</p>

<p><strong>pony</strong>: No, man, I mean it. You’re a good writer. I
remember those things you’d write during honors English. Funny shit.</p>

choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it’s not big enough.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you

ease.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wow, that must be pretty nice there.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it’s, you know, it’s a
bed and hot water.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It does look good.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean,

you to do the cover.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You’re not serious.</p>

see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of
humor. You live your lives, you know. It’s simple, you know. The guys on
the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks… and
Danny, all Danny talks about is money.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, we’re all above that.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it,
it’s a song about…</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Well, play it, man.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah, come on, play it.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, no, man. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Play it! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, it’s new.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I just started it.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I don’t care. I’m gonna drop it. I’m gonna
drop it. I’m…</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Don’t drop the guitar, man.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: No, no, whoa!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yes! Free concert!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Alright, Pony!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Alright, alright already.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yes! Hey, unplugged Pony!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: “Drove down the highway there was a big jam
The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It
went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while” Chorus
here. “You may think there’s nothing to it and the truth is hard to see
To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to
be”</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: That was so great!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s coming along.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, I’m glad you put truth in your song, man.
That’s important.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Hey, thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So who are you?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, if we’re, like, the man invisible, what
are you?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I don’t know. Uh, I’m an artist, I guess. You
know, there’s life and then there’s the people watching the life,
commenting on it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s what I do too.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are
you so special?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Well, I, I didn’t say I was special, but it’s
one thing, you know, and it’s another thing to actually communicate it
to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one
hears it, does that make a sound?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Of course it does.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You know, that is my worst fear. Making a
sound and no one hears it.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Mine too.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: W-wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Sure. You make art and you want people to see
it.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Wait, what happened to the tree?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, but that doesn’t mean that your tree is
not artistic if no one cuts it down.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jeff likes to argue for the sake of
arguing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: So you, like, come from a town like this
or…?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, not really. I come from an “area”. Bel
Air.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You rich?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: No, not really. Middle-class.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, me too. Middle-class.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Maybe upper-middle-class.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: “See what’s around you listen to their
lies”</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: So, like, your dad’s a big deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Thinks he is. Well, he is.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: He is?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: He is.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for
your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I
mean, I know, it’s time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking.
You didn’t tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs,
you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very
nice.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: “I sound like an idiot watching the parade I
know there’s no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head
All the lies There’s no then Only now I will love show me how”</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: “I buried my hand in a fire I haven’t slept
for a week I cut my feet on the glass Never finding what I seek I need
salvation I need”</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we
would’ve gone to your concert!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So you sold ninety thousand units. So what?
Does that mean you’re a genius? You’re a great artist? You’re higher up
the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin’ forehead?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Wow, you’re cute when you’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why don’t you write a song about Sandra
Berhard’s salad, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Jesus, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Hey, man, uh, look, if you don’t like my
stuff, uh, I won’t sing it, okay? I’m sorry, you know?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying I
don’t need a limousine to know who I am, alright?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Right on. You know what? He doesn’t need the
limo, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I mean, you know, at least I admit that I
don’t know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know
that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don’t
have an answer. I don’t have a fucking message.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Okay, great. Well, now he’s crying. Are you
guys happy?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn’t funny, man.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I’m
really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it’s
you, man. It’s, you know what, you know what it is? It’s this tarpit of
stupidity that we’re all stuck in. It’s this cell. It’s this void, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it’s me,
okay? I come out here and I’m, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my
ass and I think I’m a fucking star, man, and I’m really sorry if I’m
full of attitude. I, I really…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, you know what? It’s not you, man. It’s not
anybody. It’s me. Whoo! Hey.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Look, man, it… Shit. Why don’t we get
something to eat? I mean food?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: We’d have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: China Gate’s open till midnight.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: George can drive us. There’s plenty of room in
the car. Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring
back something here. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Why don’t you come with us, man? I mean, I
want to hear about those songs you’ve been working on. You too,
Buff.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Limo ride!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Tim?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Uh, I didn’t write any songs. You guys go
ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Come on. I’m not gonna go if you don’t
come.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I just don’t feel like it. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Why don’t you just try? Please. For me. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, come on, man! Limo!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Hey, wait, where’s Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee,
where’d you go? Did you guys see where she went?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Erica, you coming?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Are you sure? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You got everything right but the car. My dad
didn’t get me a BMW.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What’d he get you?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: A Porsche.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Yeah. So, what about you?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What about me? I don’t have a car.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You just seem to know all these things about
me and I don’t know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do
you like?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Military marching bands.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You think I’m rich and you hate me.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Now, how the hell would you know what I think?
Hm? You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’d like to.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You know, it was the biggest mistake of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just
this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I
enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different
in my life.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: “It’s not a job, it’s an adventure.” Right? I
hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping
lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking
knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later
I was a free man.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You cut off your little finger?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it
back on.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Honorable discharge. Disabled while serving. I
get a check every month.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Um, four for smoking, please.</p>
<p><strong>restaurant hostess</strong>: Closed, closed.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, man, no closed, we just got here!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>restaurant hostess</strong>: Midnight closed.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, come on! We’re hungry. Please?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yo, do you know who this guy is right here?
That’s Pony Moynihan from MTV. Yeah look at his limo out there.</p>
<p><strong>restaurant hostess</strong>: TV?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: TV. MTV, what your going to turn him away?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No man. He’s probably the most famous guy
that’d ever come in this place. You’re lucky he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>restaurant hostess</strong>: Take-out only. Wait, I get
picture.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Thanks. See man?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You know? I remember coming here with my
parents.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You know, I should, um, make a video of this
place. You know, bring the camera in.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You make videos?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, yeah, all the time. That’s what I do
now.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You know what would be cool is, like, to do a
music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You
know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know,
like, “Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed.”</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: “Closed, closed, closed.” But with your
music.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You could do it.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I could.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I mean, do you have something I could show my
manager? I mean, do you have a reel?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: A reel?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I mean, what is there to be happy about
really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the
yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving
the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Erica.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Erica. So do you think you and I are alike,
Erica?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Deep down. Way down.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: It’s a mistake to think that.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: We could still talk, you know? It’s nice to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: It’s nice to do a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: That’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I’m not a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I know. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Mm-hm. I’m a big girl. I can take care of
myself. If I didn’t want to be here, I’d be in a limo right now with a
bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, no, see, you, you don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Mm-mm. Hey, when I get shitfaced I can get
this huge appetite. God. I don’t know why. Most people don’t, but I do.
Whoo!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You okay, man? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I didn’t want to eat this much, man.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Wait, I’ll get you some air.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Wait, do the windows, okay? Just do ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You done?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: Oh, crap!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, oh, hi. Oh, Missus Douglas, I hope I’m
not calling too late. No, have you seen Bee-Bee? Well, no, yeah, she
was, I was just wondering if you’d seen her. She did? Okay. Yeah. No,
I’m sorry to bother you, Missus Douglas. Okay, ’bye. Shit. She always
answers.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! Hey, you guys!</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: No. No. Put back the leprechaun.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, put it back. Oh, fuck. What are you
doing, you…</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: … idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come
on!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, man, don’t be gettin’ soft on me. I mean,
sorry, it’s okay. It’s okay, just don’t think, okay? Just don’t
think.</p>
<p><strong>sooze, buff, &amp; pony</strong>: “Black and orange Black and
orange Hear that hearty yell Rah rah rah”</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: “G, O, F, O, R, I, T. Go for it!”</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull
over really quickly?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m sorry. I, I gotta…</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck ’em. Fucking assholes.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Burnfield. No place like it.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of
the world.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I can’t believe you’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m moving.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: If…</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: No, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I don’t know. I say what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, yeah, you’re just so smart.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: That’s because I am.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It’s okay. This kind of thing happens. It’s
just never happened to me. I’m sorry. It’s true though. Mm. So, um,
what’s your TCB tattoo stand for? What’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Taking care of business.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I hate it here. It’s so ugly, it’s like being
dead. You got out of here, you know? I’m ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I
left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder
what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I think about you. I mean, a lot.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah, you know, when you called I thought,
there’s a name from the past.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean… I mean,
we’ll be working on that album cover, right?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah, I know what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time
in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I just walked all the way from Westside to
here. I haven’t walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn’t
drink.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: I don’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Can I have some?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know, one moment things are so fucked up
than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes
sense.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Did you ever hear that saying, “This too shall
pass”?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Sure, all the time, in Group.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: In Group?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a
week. It’s kind of like AA.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That
must’ve been intense.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Intense.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How long were you in there?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go
once a week. See, I’m rehabilitated.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, you shouldn’t drink. Are you gonna
drink?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I mean, that would suck if you had to go back
to rehab.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah, it would suck big time. I’d kill
myself first.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: It was pretty bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: It was like hell with windows. You know,
there’s shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean,
every day I would, I’d wake up in my cell and I’d think, my parents put
me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because
I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I
thought my parents loved me.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, do you got any water? And some B-One?
Hey, where did everybody go?</p>
<p><strong>limo driver</strong>: Hey, hey. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Sor-sorry, Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: We were all riding around and it suddenly hit
me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we’re in a
car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started
walking.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, what it was… I, I don’t want to admit
it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Well, sure, he’s rich and he’s famous. He’s
got everything and you’ve got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that
he’s stuck in that limo all the time. He’s stuck with his interviews,
he’s stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells
him to do, you know? He’s not free. He’s just part of the machine, and
if you think about it, freedom’s all that there really is.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know? And it used to scare me so much that
I didn’t know what was coming in my life.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know, like, like, I would always think,
uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn’t any
right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the
same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same
TV. Nobody’s really different, even if they think they’re different.
“Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?” And see, that’s what makes me
freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don’t care about
the result.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Anything is possible. It is night on planet
earth and I’m alive. And someday I’ll be dead. Someday I’ll just be
bones in a box, but right now, I’, not. And anything is possible. And
that’s why I can go to New York with Sooze because each moment can just
be what it is. There’s no failure, there’s no mistake. I just, I just go
there and live there and what happens, happens. And so, right now I’m
getting naked and I’m not afraid. You know? I don’t, I don’t need money,
man. I don’t, I don’t even need, I don’t even need a future. I, I could
knock out all of my teeth with a hammer. So what?! You know, I could
poke my eyes out. I’d still be alive, you know? At least I’d know that I
was doing something real for two or three seconds, you know? It’s all
about feat and I’m not afraid anymore, man. Fuck it! Fuck fear!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Bravo, you son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Is that Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, my god!</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Jeff? Do you, do you ever wake up in the
morning and think, “Well, here’s another day”? You know? It’s just like
the last one. I mean what difference does it make, you know.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You know, my mom has this saying.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: “Don’t write any checks you can’t cash.”</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Really? What else does your mother say?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Hey, where did you go? We were worried about
you.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: Uh, home, you know.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke
her up. I hope I didn’t get you in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bee-bee</strong>: You didn’t get me in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Hey, where’s Erica?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a
piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening
to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a
fucking groupie, you know.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: But wait! Sooze, I don’t wanna fight. I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out
of the car I walked all the way here.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And I fig- and I figured something out.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you
the keys to the city.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: So, how was the ride, kids?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: It was the nicest thin I’ve done in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh that’s nice for you.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Where’s Erica? You seen her?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to
the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, How’d she get back?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I called Bucky’s. I got her a cab. Is there any
hot mustard?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I’m gonna go to the car for a ’sec. I’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: They are old, we are young, they are fast, we
are fun.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay?
Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, ’cause
I, there’s something I figured out.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: God, you smell like whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted
exactly like this sparerib.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, wait, no, I thought about New York.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Forget about New York, Jeff. I don’t want to
talk about New York anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: There was this other place where they served
live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little
monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it’s brains while
it’s still alive. I didn’t go in, though, ’cause I didn’t have any money
and my mom has a saying: “Don’t write any checks you can’t cash”.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tim, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Ask your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Well, I called Erica’s beeper. There’s just no
answer.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go
get a drink first.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Well, I mean, she always answers her
beeper.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Pal, she’s a big girl, you know? I’m sure she’s
alright.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah? Well, what’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: About where she went. I mean, what bar?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: She didn’t say. Maybe she’s at the bar at the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What
did she say exactly?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my
cock.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Tim, why don’t you shut the fuck up?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I think I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: See ya later.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What? Oh, come on. You’re not gonna suck my
cock?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Fuck you, man. I never did anything to
you!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking
language, alright? Or I might have to.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, come on, Pony. I’m just kidding. Wow, you
rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there’s a life on the
road?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Don’t do that, man, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Could you give me a ride?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol’
Pony ride back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Tim, go throw up somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: You know, man, it’s none of your business what
I do, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: It’s none of my business?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, okay, it’s none of my business. Yeah, so,
you-you’re trying to fuck my best friend’s girlfriend and it’s none of
my business?!</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Nobody’s fucking anybody!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, see, Neil, if you’re fucking with one of my
friends, then you’re fucking with me.</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What are you going to do? Hm?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: If you hit me…</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: … my manager will slap an assault charge on
your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Your manager?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, just, you know, have ’em call me. Y-you
know where to find me, right?</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why
don’t you buy another beer. It’s on me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Thanks, man!</p>
<p><strong>pony</strong>: I’ll be in the car, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’m leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I
have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: For a ride.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait, away?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: To his hotel?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Shit, Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You know what we should do? Go to the…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: So you can do an album cover?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I’ve run out of words.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait. What, what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: I don’t know. And I don’t care that I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, what about us?</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What about us? I’m moving away your staying
here.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, maybe not though. That, that’s what I’m
trying to say.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: Maybe not? You think that I’m with somebody
else and now it’s maybe not?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You’re unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait, no, I… Look, Sooze, I figured something
out.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You did, huh? Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, fuck it, man!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know what? Go with him. Just go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: In the limo!!!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Do your covers and all that shit.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: ’Bye, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>sooze</strong>: You really suck, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: To women. They’re all whores. Let us not forget
what Chenowsky said. “The greatest men are the most alone.” And without
suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m not suffering, you know. I don’t give a
shit.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Good. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, no, you’re right. It’s no big deal,
you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her
close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep
significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown
eyes. In a few minutes they’ll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever,
you ever stayed in one of those places?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, it ain’t no pup tent in the garage, you
know what I mean? Fuck. So they’ll talk and talk. They’ll probably talk
all night. And, oh, they’ll decide that they’re gonna spend the night
together, right? But, you know, they’re gonna keep their underwear on
and they’re not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he’s parking the pink
Cadillac. Fuck. There’s really only one answer.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Anarchy, my friend. Fuck ’em. You know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, fuck ’em.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, no, say it like this. Fuck ’em!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Fuck ’em! Fuck ’em all, man!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yes! Your learning, kid. That’s right! You’re
learning. Oh, it’s the man.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: What’s up guys?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: This one. He causes all the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Been drinking again, Timmy-boy?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty
cop. Yeah, blow me, I’m drunk.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Okay, come on. Time to slow down.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Who’s going to slow me down? You, you fat
pig.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Alright, get in the car before I have to
embarrass you in front of your friend.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hey, Gary, how’s the divorce comin’?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Asshole. Cuff him and stuff him.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Will you stand up for me?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>chip</strong>: Come on. Inside.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Okay. We’ll go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: He’s drunk.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: He causes problems. He was here earlier.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hey, Jeff!</p>
<p><strong>jef</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You gotta help me out, man. I’m in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know?
I can come down and, and get you out.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No, no. I’m not, I’m not talking about this. I
did a bad thing, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What? What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: That chick, Erica?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, w-what happened?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you
know. It was goin’ all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you
know? And she started crying, “Tim, Tim, what’s the matter? I love you.
Don’t go!” And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid
eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin’…
Oh, man, I really…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I hit her.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why’d
you hit her?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept
hittin’ her till she didn’t move anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute. She’s
unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if
you got the guts.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh fuck.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: You know, this, what you’re doing with your
life…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: You know, it’s not you. You know? You seem
like a smart guy.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you
wouldn’t understand what is going on with me.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Oh, it’s very complicated, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home
yet?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need?
A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A
long, long, long night.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Hi, uh, yeah, I’d, like to report a… What? No,
yeah, no, I’d like to report a, report a crime. No, I can’t hold, I
don’t… alright.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of
Sooze?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: It’s gonna be a beautiful fucking day,
man.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, God! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two!</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, it’s okay for you. It’s okay.
Enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Glad it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: I’ll tell you what. When I get my
engineering degree and I’m swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very
fucking okay.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Um, if you’re talking to me, could you make
some sense? ’Cause I don’t speak Swahili.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: In two more years I’ll have an engineering
degree. We’ll sell the store, we’ll move away from Burnfield and the
store and you standing here.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Good. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: You’re a drunk and an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: You’re wife sucks my cock every night,
swallows my cum and loves it. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Yeah it’s okay. You know, we have a saying
back home: “Either the salt is rotten or the meat.”</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, well, uh, you’re not so smart, chief,
’cause I’m moving out to L.A.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Ah, that’s nice. They have many convenience
stores there for you to stand in front of.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, I wasn’t trying.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: She was at the Four Seasons last night, man.
But you shouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I’m not, I’m not worried. I’m not
worried.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No. Life is too short.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I’m not worried.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh, Buff, I’m, I’m, gonna tell you something
and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone,
alright?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, I mean, no one.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, you know me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is
serious.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Uh, last night…</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, I should’ve stuck up for you, man, I
know. You’re my friend, she’s your old lady.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I feel really bad about that, but I was busy,
you know, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with
Pony?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man.
It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony’s manager. Really
nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something
fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it’d make a
great tape.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second
alright?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No, I know what you’re going to say. I don’t
know anything about making a video. But that’s a plus.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Because since I’m just starting out, I’ve got
a fresh point of view, and that’s good for, you know, marketing,
demographics…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, listen to me. Could you just-</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: But I’d, I’d do it for free. You know, just
for my reel.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, can you listen to me for a second?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, and guess who showed up.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I know, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I’m trying to tell you. That
chick Erica?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What, they’re looking for her?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: No man, she showed up last night at the hotel.
We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What
can I say?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica
last night?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It
didn’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Y- s-sure it did.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No. It didn’t, Buff.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Wait. Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Erica is in the van back there.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She’s in the van.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: What she doin’ in the van, man?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Buff…</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: She’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Look, Tim confessed to me last night.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Tim…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Tim killed Erica. Tim’s a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: That’s bullshit. That’s total utter
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh, really? You wanna go look?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Let’s go look, then. Let’s go look, then!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: It’s bullshit. Look! Look!</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Cock-a-doole-doo! Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey! Hey.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: I’m so burnt-out.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Oh, how did you get burnt-out?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Playing with something really hot. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.
Did you get your tape?</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go
show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is
gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Oh, I’ll teach you how to surf even if you
don’t get the gig.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I can come visit?</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: You better! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If
you’re ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony
earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he’s really looking
forward to reading some of your songs.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yeah, tell Pony to go fuck himself.</p>
<p><strong>erica</strong>: Okay, I’ll do that. Okay, hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there! Hey… Not dead!
Definitely not dead!</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: See, I wasn’t making shit up, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy’s
sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don’t come back,
I’ll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with
the flow.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Alright. ’Bye, Buff.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, George.</p>
<p><strong>buff</strong>: Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They let you out?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits.
I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I
call it? She spent the night, didn’t she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you,
pal. Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You want to know what your problem is, Jeff?
You want to believe so bad, you’ll buy anything. It’s true. Look at you.
You’re gullible and you’re gutless.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, no. That’s not the way it is at all. No, I
stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend.
Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you
wouldn’t have to go to jail for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Wow. You did that for me?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, you know, all I can say is, you’re a
fucking fool.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why? Because I give a shit?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Because I care, I’m a fucking fool?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn’t even have
the guts to go look in the van, did you?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you
lied to me. You lied to me because you’re gutless. You’re a gutless,
drunken looser.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: I’m a loser. And I’m drunk. But I’m not
gutless.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You know, and what are you doing here in the
first place, man? He’s just gonna call the cops again.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Good, good. I, I hope he does.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The sun hasn’t even come up yet and you’re
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me
last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Come on. You don’t think that after they called
the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think
they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their
sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know?
Makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just
go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life?
You know, I’m supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up,
what’ll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no,
maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don’t think so, man.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just go home, alright?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: This is my home.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Why, why did you start this in the first
place, man? They never hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with
their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do
they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here.
Alright? I’m an American. And I’m owed something. Look, they took it
from me.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: They’re just people. Alright? They got
feelings, you know?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What about my feelings? What about my fucking
feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the
answers, right? Well, they don’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Will you just put the gun down?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Just put it down.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: What is this… now , huh?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Jeff, stay there.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: He’s got a gun. He’s got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, then, there now, why don’t you go inside
and call the cops and I’ll come in there and blow your fucking brains
out.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Why should I call the police, huh? They
don’t so any good.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know,
’cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: No. No, you see, I don’t have to call my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Well, what about this?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Camel jockey.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: You know, why do you call me names? You
know, I never hurt you. I’m only working here.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Yeah, yeah. That’s the fucking problem.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Look, why do you care, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Because maybe if we know each other’s names,
things wouldn’t get like this, My name’s Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>nazeer</strong>: Okay. Nazeer, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Nazeer what?</p>
