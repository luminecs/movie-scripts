<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Dano, shouldn’t we stop and help your

<p><strong>shaina</strong>: Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. He’s just
stoned.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: There’s going to be a pile up. Logs.
Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Miss, please step out of the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Excuse me, but is there some way we could
just drive around? I have a delivery.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on
the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What on Earth are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Who am I, David Blane?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Okay, quit it already.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The radio played the same songs, the old
lady’s bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: THAT’s the truck that’s going to kill
everyone!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Alright miss, calm down. I just need this
lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You’re not listening to me! You have to do
something!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us
have lives, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Why won’t anyone listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’m not going to tell you to calm down again
–</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: You couldn’t keep your dick in check for a
month?!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Great, now I’m really gonna be late.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting
paramedics for a major T.A. At –</p>
<p><strong>shaina</strong>: Kimberly, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t know what you want from me. Some crazy
chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there’d be an accident and
there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer
is this going to take?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: If I don’t get back to my classroom soon,
the kids’ll tear the room apart.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Those poor people. To think it would’ve been
us if not for…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Tell me again how it started.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Like I said, it was like I was there. I
remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on
Shaina’s face…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Do you remember what triggered it all?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The log truck…and everybody I guess.
Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something
horrible was going to happen, even before it did.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A
bad vibe, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: More than that. All the songs on the radio
were about car crashes. Some kid’s banging toy cars together. She was
dialing her cell phone with her headset on. His car was leaking oil all
over the road.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Hey, don’t be knockin’ the Chevette.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling
“pile up” for no reason. It all felt…just wrong. Just like…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I know this sounds crazy…but you all heard
about Flight 180, right? The kid who got off the plane?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You mean Alex Browning.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: …My Premonition was just like his.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: But this is where it starts to get freaky.
So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start
dying one boy one. ’Cause when your number’s up, it’s up, right? Some
people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every
last one, until they were all dead.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers
checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You do believe me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Officer Burke? Could I see you in
here?</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Tell me you didn’t start up on that
Flight 180 shit again. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Look, you weren’t there. It was weird. She
knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never
mind.</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: I thought we we re finished with
this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.</p>
<p><strong>kimber ly</strong>: But if I was never meant to pull over,
then we all should have died in the pile up.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Which means Death could be coming for us.</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Way to console the witnesses
Burke.</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: You got ‘em thinking Death is after
them? Shit, they’re the luckiest sons o’ bitches on the planet. Get this
guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some
looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I
should be so damn unlucky.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re all certifiable, you know that? I can’t
believe I’ve been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let’s go
outside.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Jeez, Mom, stop trippin’.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Look lady, we’re just yankin’ your
chain.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Yeah, you’re acting like we all just got the
Diff’rent Strokes curse or something.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s wrong with you people?</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: Kimberly…</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: Can I take her home?</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Sure, you can all go.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: First I’m stuck with Jury Duty, now this
nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I’ve
been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I know it’s crazy, but I’m really scared
for the others. I’ve got this terrible feeling.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: What feeling?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: That it’s not over yet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: Don ’t worry. Everything will be
fine, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dude! You suck! You buy one fucking ticket in
your whole life and win twenty grand? We’re going whoring in Prague, you
know this! Hold on, the boss is coming.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Ooooh, I see it now. Your future… A
transfer to another department.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You’ve made your point.</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Good. Cause we just got some new
info and I don’t ne ed you getting freaky on me.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>detective suby</strong>: Evan Shaeffer’s dead. Guess he
wasn’t as lucky as we thought.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they’ve been
playing it all day. Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it
is, gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: Route 18 was backed up for almost nine
hours today when a record breaking pile up…</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: …killed An estimated 18 people.
Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: …hoping To recover any survivors from
this tragic collision. So far, the police are refusing to release the
names of the victims until their families are notified.</p>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: The camera of a highway patrol car
managed to catch this shocking footage –</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: My Lord…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Don’t. I have to see this.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there?
That’s my fuckin’ car right there! Oh God, that’s dope.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: In other news, a freak accident took the
life of a lotto winner.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Come on, Tim, lights out already.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You think… You think those guys were b.s.-ing
us today or what?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, please. Some people just need some serious
rewiring, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Officer Burke, please?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It’s okay, Dad. I’m not ten anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m just so happy that
you’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I love you too, Dad. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: You know, after your mother died…</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: There were so many times I didn’t
think I could last another day. I can’t even tell you some of the</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I used to have those feelings, too. But
that’s when I’d think of Mom. Her strength…and courage. And I’d pray
that maybe I’d grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts
would go away.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: I don’t know what I’d do if I lost
you.</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: …at the request of the patient, you are
to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens,
safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles,
earrings, chokers, shoelaces…</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: …paper clips, watches, food, drinks,
keys, poisons, pills and medications. You have a cell phone on you?</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: Then I think we’re all done.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Wait. Is she…dangerous or something?</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: No honey, but she expects you are.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Jesus, how long are you going to keep her
locked up this way?</p>
<p><strong>physician</strong>: Depends on her, I guess. She’s
voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Clear Rivers?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I thought…I thought you might be able to
help me.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Yeah, how?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I had a premonition about the Route 18
pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Nice work. Maybe if you’re real lucky, you’ll
wind up in here with me. But I doubt you’ll survive that long.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It’s not just about me. Someone I saved
died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger,
too?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Well, if you put them on the list, they’re
already tits up.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What list?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Death’s list. The precise order you’re going
to die in.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact
order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was
Death’s original design.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Exact order? Then I’m next! I was meant to
die with my friends, so I’m next!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: But you said someone else died last night.
That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have intervened.
Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Officer Burke pulled me away from the
crash that killed my friends.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last
to go. But don’t worry, once the others are dead, it’ll come back for
you. Always does.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: That still doesn’t make sense. You said
you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan
Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It’s moving backwards? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Yes. In my premonition that Nora woman and
her kid died first, then Evan and then…my friends.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Backwards…that’s new.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: That’s good. Get all your tears out now,
you’ll need your eyes. For the signs.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Signs?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: If you have the same power as Alex, you’ll be
seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-
face irony kinda thing? Don’t ignore it. It usually means the difference
between life and death.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The songs on the radio. But wait. I don’t
understand. Why is this even happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: That’s what Alex used to ask himself right up
until…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It’s obvious you know what you’re talking
about. You beat it. You have to help us.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I didn’t beat it; I hid from it. If you were
smart you’d put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the
dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.
Don’t make new friends, don’t fall in love, and don’t ever bother trying
to save others. That’s the worst killer of them all.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: How can you say that? What kind of monster
are you?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: My family is dead. My friends are dead. And
Alex…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: And yes, that’s the blade of a fucking
ceiling fan in his head.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Know what? I think you’re a coward. I
think you hide out in here because you’re too damn bitter and selfish to
care about another</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I tried calling last night but your father
–</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Evan Shaeffer’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I know. I’ve gotten calls all morning from
everyone who was on the onramp. We’re all meeting at my apartment
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Then you believe all this?? That Death is
working off a list?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I didn’t. Until I was dispatched to clean up
one of the Flight 180 survivors.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Clean up? I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ki mberly</strong>: Did you see that??</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Pigeons… It’s a sign! If Clear’s right
about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by
Pigeons!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’m not following you –</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: They’re next on the list. We have to find
them.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You think the tooth fairy’s gonna come tonight?
I’m thinkin’ like fifteen bucks.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nice try, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sure hon. I’m fine. Let’s shake it, we’re
late.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Not so much.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Turn around. The cleaning woman said
they’re at the dentist’s. 14th and Main.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: I’m a little disappointed, Tim. Does your
mom know you’ve been smoking?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Yeah, that’ll have to be filled.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Jesus. Every day at the same damn time.
Now this’ll only sting for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Open big. Wiiiiider…</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: How the hell do they expect me to… Would
you rather have the laughing gas?</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Jean? I need you in here. Jean??!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Open big. Wiiiiiider.</p>
<p><strong>bang! sfx</strong>: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon
finally crashed through the window. In the other room.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lees</strong>: Goddamn it already.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: What are they doing here? And why are they
yelling “pigeons”?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Nora’s not coming. She refuses to leave her
son.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: We have to tell her she’s in danger!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I did. And right now, I don’t think she
cares.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It’s happening again. It’s fucking</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: But we’re all going to die. We can’t stop
it. It’s just a matter of time. I’m so scared.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I am too. But you can use that fear. It’ll
sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It’s the only way
you’ll be able to sav e the others…and me.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I know you didn’t ask for any of this,
Kimberly. But I don’t think you have it in you to quit either.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The second one just dies. A 16 year old
kid.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I hope you’re ready for this.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: This is cheery.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Who is this guy, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a
lot more about death than he ever told us.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Should we knock?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: He probably already knows we’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Hello, Clear. I’ve been keeping an eye
out for you.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh my God. That’s Evan Shaeffer.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Come to… Pick my brain?</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for
cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the
final –</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Just a simple question and we’ll leave you
alone with your new friend.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: How do you cheat Death once and for all?</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Dead. But still fresh.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if
you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure
would be swell if you told us.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: For what purpose? You seek a back way out
of a room with but one door. You can’t cheat Death; there</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct
design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once,
but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Such fire in you now. People are always
most alive just before they die. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It can be beaten. And you know it.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Some say that there is a balance to
everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the
universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every
death a life…</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis;
Only new life can defeat death. The list of life is forever set by the
Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe,
down to its tiniest element s.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: The list accounts for every life; from
the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life
that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could
invalidate Death’s list, shatter its very existence.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: To figure that out you’ll have to follow
the sign s.</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: But be warned. To disrupt the grand
design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the
threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: One last question. Why is Death working
backwards this time?</p>
<p><strong>mortician</strong>: Sorry, time’s up.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: New life defeats death? Follow the signs?
Where the hell did you find that guy?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be
helpful.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: He was. If we can use your ability to see the
signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what “new life”
means. I know, it worries me that I</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: What the fuck are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>skate rat</strong>: I’m thinkin’, suck my junk, bee
yatch.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What is it? What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: You’re strong. Do you hear me? You’re a
fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single
most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I was driving a white van. It must’ve gone
out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It
was…horrible.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: You were there?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I can practically taste the water in my
throat. And something else. The smell of flowers…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Then it wasn’t just a sign. It was a
premonition?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant
woman in a white delivery van.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Holy shit. He said “only new life can defeat
death.” If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a
brand new soul that was never part of Death’s Design…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It throws the entire Death list out of
whack. And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch. We all start
over with a clean slate.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: It sounds all well and good, but</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Please, what else could it mean?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: So if you give us the pregnant lady’s
number, we can warn her about the lake and she’ll live long enough to
have the baby.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: So let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Shit, I don’t have her number. She was never
interviewed. She took off right after the accident.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: How are we going to find her? There must
be thousands of white vans in this state.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hey, I’m a police officer, remember?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I, uh…sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I know, I know. We need my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It’s all right. I’ll take watch.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I’m okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put
it back on.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Make sure all these people will be at the
meeting tonight.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I don’t get it. Why is everything happening
so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now
five people are dead in less than a day.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Here we go. The vehicle’s a delivery van
registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there’s almost a
dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We need to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Let’s lay this on her gently now. The stress
alone could upset the pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I’m Officer Burke. I’m looking for an
Isabella Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Shut up!!!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Are you Jorge Cruz?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Maybe. What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: May we come in?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: No. What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: It’s about your wife, Isabella. Now is she
here?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: No. I’m alone.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Look, pal, it’s probably nothing. But I need
to see –</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Forget it. You’ll need a warrant. I know, I’m
a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Stop!!! You can’t go in there!!!</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: We never meant to hurt you Isa…You’re
not Isabella!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I’m going to sue your ass!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Whose blood is that on the floor?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this
afternoon. Now arrest her!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Where’s Isabella? Did you finally kill her
you fucking wife beater?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: We had a fight. Some things got broken, the
dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn’t say where she was going.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What was the fight about?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Take a guess.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Does she have a cell phone? A way we can
contact her?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: She did.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We’re wasting time with this piece of shit.
Let’s just get to the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid’s
half mine.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We can only pray it doesn’t come out
retarded.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Jesus Christ. I wrote to management two weeks
ago about these friggin’ bumpers.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Damn, is that dogshit?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Does anybody have a Valium?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You’ll want to take –</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: – half of that.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Any word yet on the Dodge van? Damn.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: So that would mean… I’m next.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Nobody’s next. This is crazy. First death’s
stalking us and now premonitions?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: This can’t be happening. My career’s at a peak,
I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house…</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Just shut the fuck up and maybe you’ll
live.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: You’re not next, Nora. Nobody has to be next.
That’s the point. Last time, we didn’t plan. We weren’t organized. Now
we can help each other.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Think what would have happened if Kimberly
had been able to warn you with the word pigeons…</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The point is, as long as you know what to
beware of, you have a fighting chance. It can be beaten. If I call you
and say subway, get to a high rise fast. A place where no subway could
possibly go, get it?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the
first place? That’s me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Anyone read today’s paper? The article on
Evan Shaeffer?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: The only reason he was on Route 18 was
because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: That lucky bastard.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you
were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The new freeway was faster, but Route 18
was the way my mom used to take, so…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Route 18 is Drake’s assignment, but he
called in sick so I got… Drake’s never sick.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I was my first day of jury duty.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Jury duty? That’s randomly selected by
social security numbers.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Random, sure.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What, you think Death planned for each of us
to die in the pile up weeks ago? You’re nuts.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a
radio station by accident. They asked me what number means “good luck”
in Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Eighteen. And it’s “Hebrew”.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Anyway, I guessed it right and won these.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route
18.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I don’t know what’s weirder, the dialing a
wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in
advance.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Whoa, nine months?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Are you thinking what I’m thinking?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Yes, I’d like to report a domestic
squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I’m at the Super
8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I’m sorry, Dad, we’re having a hard time
with Shaina’s eulogy. I’ll stay here at Virginia’s tonight and see you
tomorrow. I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Remember everyone, just because Kimberly’s
got the power doesn’t mean we’re not all capable of seeing signs to some
extent.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: It’s like Forrest Gump.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The
institution’s made me soft.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: If Death has got such a hard-on for you,
maybe you should get the hell away from us.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: We need her. She’s the only one who’s
dealt with this before, idiot!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We’re all going to have to open our eyes from
now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. And we’ve got to
safeproof this deathtrap.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Screw this. I’m going outside for a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You think you should? It’s not safe out
there.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: So? Nora’s gotta bite it before me anyway,
right?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Where are you going, Nora? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim.
There’s nothing left for me.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Don’t say that. Once you lose hope, it’s
already too late.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If it’s my time to go, to be in heaven with my
family, then I can accept that.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You can’t give up. Don’t accept Death’s
plan. Trust me, you can fight this. If we can just survive long enough
until that baby is born, we can –</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If you’ll excuse me, I have a funeral to
prepare.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just
got out of the nut house?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Seeing you die once was enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Whatever. I control my life, not fate.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I’ll be sure to put that on your
tombstone.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Be careful. And even if you don’t believe,
give this to Nora.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: …man with hooks. I see a man with hooks.
Someone?!?!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I kinda see it, yeah. So…Nora’s going to be
killed by a man with hooks?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Going down, right?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Um, by the way, your shoe’s untied.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Probably for you, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Officer Burke? I can’t hear…</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Let me go let me go!</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Oh, watch it, you’ve caught your uh…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you
with…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: You alright, Nora?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: My God, someone please let me out of this
–</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: …no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die
on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What the hell are you…?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Ain’t going out like that. On my terms!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Just take it easy!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You don’t keep it loaded?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Maybe they were all duds.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Six in a row? Never. Impossible. That’s like
…winning the lottery.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It wasn’t his turn to die.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Can we find the pregnant woman, please?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Um, Clear? I’m sorry…about before. I…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Your entire world view just went out the
window. I couldn’t expect a religious conversation overnight. We’ll get
through this. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: When I die. Is it gonna hurt?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: And you’re gonna die after me, right?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Would you take these? And if I die… Could you
throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know… Anything that
would break my mom’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella Cruz is
being detained up in Greenwood. Let’s finish this thing.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Is this safe, guys? I mean, someone in this
car is about to get whacked. Do the rest of us really feel like sitting
next to him? Or her. Hopefully her.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Guys, let’s not panic. Isabella’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You said she was going to drive into a lake.
How can she when she’s in protective custody?</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What do you mean “grand theft auto?” This
is insane.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hopefully the district judge can straighten
it all out by Monday mor ning.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Jorge. When I get out of here I’m going to
sue his cheating ass off.</p>
<p><strong>is abella</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Are you kidding me?! Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: C’mon. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Damn, they always stick me with the
clunker.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Take my van!</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Here’s what I don’t get. For nine months,
Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on
Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up…</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: But why single me out? What am I in the great
scheme of things? You’d think I stepped off Flight 180 or something…
Fucking weird, man.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You want weird? Last year, my partner and I
were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train
wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I got that beat. So like, last May, I was
supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There
was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated
during the night.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Yeah, so what happened?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on
splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Was that in Mt. Abraham?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Yeah. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: That bus you were on? It killed Terry
Mathers. She was supposed to die on Flight 180.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I’m not sure I–</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Shit. The call about the train wreck that
saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Another kid from Flight 180.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Promise me…I won’t have the</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Get around it!!!</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed
last year, killed everyone inside?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: I had tickets to go, but one day I’m in Paris,
trippin’ on acid, sippin’ lattes an’ such, and this dude gets whacked by
a falling sign.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Carter.</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart
for four hours. ’Course, missed the show…</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: A little over a year ago, my mother and I
went to the mall. I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught
up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide. I
kept thinking, “How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub?” That’s
retarded.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It felt wrong. And yet… There were
gunshots outside and I ran… Some kids tried to jack her car. She fought
them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: After the funeral I had this overwhelming
feeling that it should have been me. I figured that’s how everyone must
feel. But I guess I was right.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It’s all starting to come together. When Alex
got us off Flight 180, it didn’t just change our lives. It</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m not sure I understand.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Being alive after our time caused an outward
ripple - a rift in Death’s design.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: So if you never got off the plane, none of
us would be ali ve in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: That’s why Death is working backwards. It’s
tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all �</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re okay, we’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Please. It’s not going to wait.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ve got to stop and help those people.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: Do you want to deliver this baby?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Not my time. Amazing…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Is everybody alright?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: He can’t breathe! He can’t breathe!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Oh my god, Eugene!?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Call 9- 1-1!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Stop it, don’t move him!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Someone call for help!</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I can’t move my fucking leg! Please get me out
of here before it explodes!</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Watch it, dude!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Help us, we need help over here!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I don’t smell any gas. And none’s dripping,
either.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Stop that! I still need this foot, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Be careful with that, check the gages on the
regulator and be mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch for potholes and
puddles.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Look, I made him a promise –</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Sorry. There’s no room.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Get that over here! Move move move!</p>
<p><strong>rescue worker</strong>: Excuse me, hot soup coming
through.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: One more thing. Watch out for power
lines.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: We have to contact Isabella now!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Rory!!!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Where’s the cell phone Clear gave you?</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at
your place.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood
Police Station and warn Isabella.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You doing alright in there?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why
am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time,
pal?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: She’s at Phelps Memorial. They’re prepping her
to give birth right now.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: A few miles up the road. Near the docks.</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: Damn, can’t you be quieter with that thing?</p>
<p><strong>rescue worker</strong>: Sure, I’ll just set it to the “quiet”
mode.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: We gotta go now. Isabella’s in labor.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What about that?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: How you doing in there, hero?</p>
<p><strong>kat</strong>: I guess it could be worse.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: So let’s go…Where the hell is Rory?!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: I didn’t mean to do it - I didn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: It wasn’t his turn. And it’s not my
turn.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Give me the keys to your truck. Now!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Anything you want. Anything. I wish I
knew. I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hurry up. There’s no time. She’s about to
give birth.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it’ll
be me. But I can’t die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I’m last
on Death’s list.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Are you crazy? What makes you think you’d
survive?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What happened when Eugene tried to kill
himself out of turn?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Six duds in a row.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: And when it was Rory’s turn to die, and
Thomas was in the way?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: That branch fell and saved my life. You’re
right, Death’s maintaining the order.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Let’s pray that Isabella’s still
alive.</p>
<p><strong>staff</strong>: …contractions coming quicker now. Take her
pressure and CTG. One centimeter dilation. Prep the epidural stat.</p>
<p><strong>anesthesiologist</strong>: She’s going to have to stop moving
if I’m going to –</p>
<p><strong>anesthesiologist</strong>: Goddamn it, keep her still!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sorry, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>anesthesiologist</strong>: Perfectly still now…</p>
<p><strong>anesthesiologist</strong>: Done. Now could someone please
find the open window and fucking close it?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed
to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we
had her arrested?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I don’t think so. Alex’s premonitions
happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Then the only way to survive is to get to
the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: If only Alex and I had done that with the
others, Alex might still be…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You
may wanna slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Don’t worry. Nothing can happen to us.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I wasn’t worried about us.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Kimberly! Slow down!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Slow down! We’re…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: What did you see? What am I looking for?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: No, it’s not here. This one was different.
More like the pile up and the van going into the lake. It wasn’t just a
sign, I was there.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Another premonition?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Yes. I was in a hospital. There was
screaming… A nurse was choking me. I couldn’t tell wh at she looked
like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Kalarjian?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going
to choke Isabella to death!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Quite complaining. I got burnt babies in the
Children’s Ward braver than you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Don’t bother. You won’t be talking for at
least a month. Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Don’t worry. Everyone learns to love me once
they get used to my sense of humor, okay?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Shouldn’t we pull over?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: No time. Keep going. I wouldn’t know how to
explain any of this anyway.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh come on.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Speed up.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Yeah, fuck ’em. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Be alive, Isabella, please be alive.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: …ironically impaled through the head as
a result of an emergency airbag deploying.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I’ll bring
crosswords for you, too.</p>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: …police Have speculated that one of
the deaths may have been</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up
next, Johnny Showers has the weather…</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Jeez, it’s freezing in here.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: What are you doing? The Henzels are
still waiting for you in the Children’s Ward –</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Right, right, right. Gregory’s big day.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy
can’t feel her legs.</p>
<p><strong>anchor woman</strong>: Mor e tears were shed this morning in
the wake of yesterday’s tragedy that rocked the Tri -State area…</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Isabella Cruz. What room’s she in?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t give out that info
unless you’re a relative.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I’m her sister.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’ll have to see your ID,
Ms. Cruz.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Delivery rooms are downstairs. I’ll find
Eugene and catch up with you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hurry, I think she’s this way.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Security?</p>
<p><strong>obstetrician</strong>: Listen to me, Isabella, I need you to
stop pushing.</p>
<p><strong>isabella</strong>: What’s wrong? IS the baby all right?</p>
<p><strong>obstetrician</strong>: It’s a breach. If I can’t reverse</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe I should step outside.</p>
<p><strong>pa announcement</strong>: Code Blue in Delivery Room 6. Code
Blue!</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Just where do you think you’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>obstetrician</strong>: Almost there. I see the head…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What are you doing in here? Get the hell out!
Right now!</p>
<p><strong>obstetrician</strong>: Isabella, look down and see your
son.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: A guard grabbed me before I could find
Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Don’t sweat it. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: She had the baby?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: New life defeats death. We’ve done it.
Death has to rewrite the list. We’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Kimberly! Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Are you okay? You just face planted!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I know how it feels to be dead.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG
machine. Where’s Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: But it’s over. Isabella’s baby was the key.
You saw her die and everything, right?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I don’t…what if I made a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Impossible. She was on the onramp.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I’m not sure… I don’t think Isabella was
ever destined to die in the pile -up.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Then what’s the premonition of the lake
supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Can you remember anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: …the Same hands from the van.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: It’s you Kimberly. The premonitions are about
you.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: No! It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: I have to save Eugene!</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Eugene? Are you in there?</p>
<p><strong>clear</strong>: Can you hear me? I’m coming in .</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Make way, make way lovebirds.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Nurse Kalarjian…</p>
<p><strong>dr. kalarjian</strong>: Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me,
please.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh my God. That’s it. The lake. The EEG
machine. Nurse Kalarjian.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You can’t cheat destiny. I know what I
have to do to save us. I have to die.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: That’s crazy. You can’t give up now. We can
still fight this thing.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: I have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>emt</strong>: What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kalarjian</strong>: Ready and…CLEAR!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: She’s back!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kalarjian</strong>: Five CC’s of narcodon. I want her
stabilized and prepped for ICU.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Kimberly?!</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Welcome back. We did it. For real.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: I know. I can feel it too.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: My God, this is delicious. I can’t believe
I used to be a vegan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. burroughs</strong>: So what’s the deal, Thomas? Three
months and you still haven’t asked my daughter out on a date.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: What’s wrong with a platonic
relationship?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Platonic my ass. That’s for ugly
women.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: For God’s sake, leave him alone, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah, don’t make me cite you for
harassment.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Oh please. I’m not hurting anyone.
Besides, if you can beat Death,</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: You know, you still never explained to
us how you did it.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Well, technically when we died, we gave
Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already
moved on to graver pastures.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gibbons</strong>: You know, I’m having the greatest
day?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Food’s great too, Mrs. Gibbons. Big props
to you and Brian.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gibbons</strong>: Our…pleasure. So, ready for the
back-to -school season? NYU, right?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Three short glorious weeks away.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gibbons</strong>: Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going
myself.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: You may want to think twice about
letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there
and came back with piercings all over her face. Among other places.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Dad used to call her the pincushion. From
Hellraiser.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Dad, you had the spatula last, right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Sure, here.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Brian looks like he’s having fun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Sure does. Owes it to that friend of
yours, in a way.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gibbons</strong>: Well, Brian was nearly hit by an
ambulance the day…but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last
second.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. gibbons</strong>: You never told me that, Peter. Boy,
that was lucky.</p>
