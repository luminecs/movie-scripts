a look at your catch?</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: Me, I woulda thrown ’em back. Vamanos.
Fuera. Hagan una lina!</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
head? Two hundred? I hope you saved it all for your lawyer, pal, ’cause
you’re gonna need –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’ll take it from here.</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: INS Division 6.</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: Division 6? I never heard of Division
6.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What’re we thinking, Dee?</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: Tough call, Kay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: !Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey! No se
preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los Estados Unidos. Welcome to the United
A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo, no? Buena suerta. Antonio?
Looking for work, aren’t you? Good Es un placer verle aqui.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Que dices si te rompo la cara?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol, verdad,
amigo?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We got a winner. Los restos estan libres a
irse. Largense!</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: Sir, you can’t just –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t “Sir” me! You have no idea who you’re
dealing with!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’re gonna have a little chat with our friend
here. You boys can hit the road … and keep on protecting us from
dangerous aliens.</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: You ever heard of Division 6?</p>
<p><strong>2nd ins agent</strong>: There is no Division 6.</p>
<p><strong>3rd ins agent</strong>: Who are those guys?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
part of town, amigo. In fact, I’ll bet dollars to pesos that you’re not
–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: – from anywhere near here.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Political refugee. Right.</p>

you.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Okay, everybody, situation’s under control,
calm down. If you’ll just give me your attention for a moment I’ll tell
you what happened.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This is called a “neuralyzer.” A gift from some
friends from out of town. The red eye here isolates and measures the
electronic impulses in your brain. More specifically, the ones for
memory.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
holes at 40, 60, and 80.</p>
<p><strong>2nd ins agent</strong>: What in the hell is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Exactly the right question. And the answer lies
right – here. Pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>janus</strong>: Who are you, really?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Really? I’m just a figment of your
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: God, we’re a gullible breed.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive
after a blast like that.</p>
<p><strong>agent janus</strong>: What – blast?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need to
exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Especially you.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: I’m sorry. About…back there.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Happens.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: Didn’t used to.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: The spirit’s willing, Kay, but the rest of
me…</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: They’re beautiful, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: The stars. We never just – look. Anymore. I’ll
tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No. You won’t.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Stop! NYPD!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: All yours, Edwards!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Grand Central Station off to your left,
folks…</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Dammit, man, you’re making me sweat up my
gear!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Yo, man, your luck just ran out.</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: He’s coming! He’s coming!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: And when he gets here, I’ll kick his ass
too.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Wassup?</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: He’s coming! He’s coming because I failed, and
now he’ll kill me too!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>perp</strong>: You don’t understand. Your world is gonna
end.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: What are you?!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
again with another completely different set.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sort of a low beam, high beam.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Was that before or after he drew the
weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: After, sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: And why do you suppose none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: ’Cause some of the other officers are a
little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn’t keep up, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
am –</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: What do you mean? I am half the man you
are.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What the hell is your problem?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: My problem is you being all up in my damn
face all the time.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
minutes – your best shot.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
pudgy bastard.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
believe you. I opened him up. Find me at the morgue. On 26th. I’ll tell
you what I found.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Hey…Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You have really pretty eyes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dr. Weaver, from the coroner’s office?
Working on the John Doe?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Yes. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Would you look right here, please.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Look where?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Some night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Oh, yeah, some night.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: They were gills.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not eyelids.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Did he say anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
an end.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Did he say when?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it
again?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Let’s take a ride.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Wait a minute. I got a ton of
paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: It’s all done.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Good work, Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You ran that guy down on foot? That’s tough.
That’s double tough.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: So who you with?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You got the plain clothes, the
government-issued wheels. Secret Service?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Yeah, well, whoever it is, you’re short on
funding.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Nothing is what it seems, kid.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Oh, yeah, my bad ’86 Ford LTD. That’s a
luxury ride. C’mon, who ya with?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’m part of a secret organization that monitors
and polices alien activity on earth.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: This is where we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
Doesn’t even sell guns.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: All right, you think it’s worth shaking him
up, fine. I’ll do my thing. Then I want some answers.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Do your “thing,” kid. Edwards goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how’d these
get here? I thought I turned ’em in to the proper authorities.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: Sure – I’m a big crack dealer now. I just
work here because I love the hours.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: I’m talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: C’mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I
got.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Why don’t you show him the imports, Jeebs.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: H-hiya Kay, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: The imports, Jeebs. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: You know I got outta that business a long
time ago, Kay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
lie.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’m going to count to three.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: He’ll do it, Jeebs.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: I’ve seen him do it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Talk to me, Jeebs, he’s crazy when he’s
like this.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: He’s always crazy. Take a cruise. Get a
massage –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Put down the gun and put your hands on the
counter!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I warned him.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Drop the weapon!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You warned him.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You are under arrest. You have the right to
remain silent.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Will you relax?</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: Do you know how much that hurts?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I’ll use up
another one.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Edwards?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Uh, this. This is what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
to an unlicensed cephlapoid.</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: He looked all right to me.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: A carbonizer is an assassin’s weapon, Jeebs.
Who was the target?</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Jeebs!</p>
<p><strong>jeebs</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This is all confiscated. All of it. I want you
on the next transport off this rock. Or I’ll shoot you where it doesn’t
grow back.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Yeah. I’ll be by tomorrow for those
Rolexes.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: The eyelids, fine … and the jumping thing …
and the gun … okay, but the head?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Searching for a handle on the moment here? A
place to file all this.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: See a head doesn’t do that, it doesn’t just
grow back. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Can’t help you, kid. Only comfort I can offer
is that tomorrow, you won’t remember a thing.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Oh, no. This I’m gonna remember for a long,
long time.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Ever see one of these?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: – and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but
this one’s eating my popcorn!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg
rolls.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: See what I mean about tequila? You’re a bright
young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I’ll see you tomorrow, nine
a.m. sharp.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Another beer?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Coffee. Please.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I go out, I work my butt off to make a
living, all I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat
steak on the table, but instead I get this – this – I don’t even know
what you call this!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I’ll tell you what it looks like, it looks
like poison. Don’t you take that away, I’m eating that, damn it! It is
poison, isn’t it?!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I swear to God, I would not be surprised if
it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much – or
ain’t been hit enough, I can’t make up my mind.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’re useless, Beatrice! The only thing that
pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Stay here!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: What is it, Edgar?!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Get your big butt back in that house!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Place projectile weapon on ground.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You can have my gun when you pry it from my
cold, dead fingers!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Your proposal is acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: What on earth was it?!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Sugar.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I’ve never seen sugar do that.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Give me sugar.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: In water.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Edgar, your skin! It’s – it’s – just
hanging off your bones!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: That better?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Maybe, I’m not sure, see, I got this card
–</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Elevator. Push the “call” button.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You’re late. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: My name is Zed. You’re all here because you’re
the best of the best. Marines, Navy SEALS, Army Rangers…NYPD.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And we’re looking for one of you. Just one.
What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor
skills, hand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina – I see we have a
question.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Why, uh – I’m sorry, it’s just no one
really asked this, but – why, exactly, are we doing this?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Son?</p>
<p><strong>ambitious recruit</strong>: Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate
with honors. We’re here because you’re looking for the best of the best
of the best, sir!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What’s so funny, Edwards?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: I – I don’t know, sir. This guy. “Best of
the best of the best of the best of the –” It just struck me as –
Humorous. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay. Let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Anyone, uh…any of you guys know what we’re
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>marine</strong>: Looking for the best of the best of the
best.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Well, yeah, I know, but…</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: The hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Hesitated, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved
to die?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: She was the only one who actually seemed
dangerous. At the time.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And how did you come to that conclusion?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
think with a hook for a head. Answer; it’s not his head. His head is
that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there. ’Cause if you look at the
snarling beast-guy, he’s not snarling, he’s sneezing – he’s got tissues
in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow, the girl’s books were way too
advanced for an eight-year-old’s. And besides, from where I’m looking,
she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. And I don’t
appreciate your jumping down my throat about it.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Or, uh – do I owe her an apology?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: He’s got a real problem with authority.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed. On
foot. Tenacity. That I can use.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I hope you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Congratulations, you’re everything we’ve come
to expect from years of government training. Now, if you’ll just follow
me, we have one more test to administer, an eye exam.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You! Hey, what’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Back in the mid-fifties, the government started
a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of
making contact with a race not of this planet.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Now, if you’ll look directly at the end of this
device.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Everybody thought the agency was a joke. Except
the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New York
City.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: There were nine of us that night. Seven agents.
An amateur astronomer. And one poor kid who got lost on the wrong back
road.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: You brought the aliens flowers?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: They were intergalactic refugees with a simple
request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a
planet. Ever see “Casablanca?” Same thing, no Nazis. We agreed. So we
masked all evidence of their landing.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: The 1964 World’s Fair was a coverup?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Why else would we hold it in Queens? Now left.
More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: I see. Not to change the subject, but when
was your last cat-scan?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Every six months; it’s company policy.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
but I’m hopin’ you’ll show me where I came in? ’Cause this is where I go
out.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
while we’re right here.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t tell me we’ve only got that powdered shit
for cream again?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: For future reference, this is a better look for
you.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed
aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most
aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Cab drivers?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not as many as you’d think. Humans, for the
most part, don’t have a clue. Don’t want one, either. They’re happy.
They think they’ve got a pretty good bead on things.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Why the big secret? People are smart, they
can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: A person is smart. People are dumb. Everything
they’ve ever “known” has been proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe.
Five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you
knew we humans were alone on it. Imagine what you’ll know tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: So what’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What you’ll gain in perspective, you’ll lose in
ways you’re too young to comprehend. You give up everything. Sever every
human contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Nobody?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re not even allowed a favorite shirt.
There. That’s the speech I never heard. That’s the choice I never
got.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Hold up. You track me down, put me through
those stupid-ass tests, now you’re trying to talk me out of it. I don’t
get it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You got ’til sun-up.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You find out, you let me know.</p>
<p><strong>orkin man</strong>: Well, well, well. Movin’ right in, are
we? Think we own the place?</p>
<p><strong>orkin man</strong>: Got a little eviction notice for you,
boys.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Just what exactly do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>orkin man</strong>: Takin’ care of your pest problem.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: “Pest” problem? “Pest?”</p>
<p><strong>orkin man</strong>: Yeah. You got a hell of an
infestation.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You know, I have noticed an infestation here.
Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely
conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they
scurry about their short, pointless lives.</p>
<p><strong>orkin man</strong>: Well – yeah. Don’t you want to get rid of
’em?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: In the worst way.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: One thing you gotta know right now.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: All right. I’m in because there’s some
next-level shit going on around here, and I’m with that. Before you beam
me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. You chose
me ’cause you recognize the skills. So as of now you can cease with all
of that calling me “son” or “kid” or “sport.” Cool?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Cool, slick. Now about those skills of
yours,</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: As of this moment, they don’t mean much.</p>
<p><strong>passport officer</strong>: Purpose of trip?</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: Diplomatic mission.</p>
<p><strong>passport officer</strong>: Duration of stay?</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: Lunch.</p>
<p><strong>passport officer</strong>: Carrying any fruits or
vegetables?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Let’s go. He’s a little…grouchy.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
flight would get on anybody’s nerves.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: What branch of the government do we report
to?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: None. They started asking too many
questions.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: So who pays for all this?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens.
Liposuction.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Here. A new recording device to replace CD’s.
So now I gotta buy the White Album again? This is amusing. Universal
translator.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’re not supposed to have it. I’ll tell you
why. Human thought is so primitive it’s considered an infectious
disease. Makes you proud, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t touch that!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Caused the ’77 New York blackout. Practical
joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it was funny as hell.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Observation, the heart of our little
endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This map shows the location of every registered
alien on earth at any given time. Some of them we keep under constant
surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
public – normal. In private – you’ll get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Meet the twins.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: I gotta be honest about something.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: It makes no sense?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was crazy ’cause I swore that our
teacher was from, like, Venus or something.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mrs. Edelson.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: What’s your jacket size, Edwards?</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Uh – forty regular.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Then let’s put it on.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Put what on?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: The last suit you’ll ever wear.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: From now on, you’ll dress only in attire
specially sanctioned by MIB Special Services.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You’ll conform to the identity we give you, eat
where we tell you, live where we tell you, get approval for any
expenditure over a hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You will have no identifying marks of any kind.
You will not stand out in any way.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Your entire image is carefully crafted to leave
no lasting memory whatsoever with anyone you encounter.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You’re a rumor, recognizable only as deja vu
and dismissed just as quickly. You don’t exist; you were never even
born.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Anonymity is your name. Silence your native
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You are no longer part of “the system.” We’re
above the system. Over it. Beyond it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’re “them.” We’re “they.”</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We are the Men in Black.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The difference between you and me?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I make this look good.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Okay, let’s see. Bee, we got the deposed
sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland
tonight. I’m pulling you down from Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.</p>
<p><strong>bee</strong>: Humanoid?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You wish. Bring a sponge. What else –
everybody, we gotta keep Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system, he’s
scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat wants to reveal himself on
“Unsolved Mysteries.” Bee, make sure he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Red-letter from last night – we had an
un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate New York farm country. Keep
your ears open for this one, Kay, we’re not hosting a galactic kegger
down here.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, well, well – we got a skimmer.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Landed alien out of zone. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Redgick. He’s not cleared to leave Manhattan
but he’s way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey
Turnpike. Why don’t you take Jay? This is a good one for him to warm up
on.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yo, wussup with Zed? “Go get em, tiger. We’re
not hosting an intergalactic kegger…”</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Zed was saving the world before you were born,
son. Show some respect.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: We got the use of unlimited technology from the
entire universe and we cruise around in this?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know, ya’ll gotta learn how to talk to
people. You could be a little kinder and gentler.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Buckle up, please.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now did that hurt?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Makin’ fun of my ride…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Jay. The button?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Never push the button, Jay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: License and registration, please.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Other license and registration, please.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Your resident card has you restricted to the
five boroughs only. Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: It’s my wife! She’s – she’s – well,
look!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh God. How soon?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Okay. All right. No big deal. You handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Sure, it’s easy, you just sorta – catch.</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: Are you sure he knows what he’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
C’mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Croagg the Midwife’s back on 64th and 8th. You
were headed out of town.</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: Well, we’re, uh – meeting someone.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
that?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: So? Who you meeting?</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: Well, it’s – a ship.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Really? I didn’t see a departure clearance for
today.</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: You didn’t? Uh, well – it was an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Guys – guys –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Doin’ fine, Ace. What kind of emergency? What’s
the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Help?! HELP! Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>redgick</strong>: We just don’t like the neighborhood
anymore. Some of the – new arrivals.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What new arrivals? This have anything to do
with the crasher from last night?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Can you guys do this later?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh – oh – oh – man.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Congratulations! It’s a lizard.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, you know, it is sorta –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Anything about that seem unusual to you?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Pick.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What kind of “new arrival” would scare Redgick
so bad that he’d risk a warp jump with a newborn? Let’s check the hot
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: These are the hot sheets?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Best damn investigative reporting on the
planet. But hey, go ahead, read the New York Times if you want. They get
lucky sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re actually looking for tips in a
supermarket tabloid?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not looking for. Found.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not so fast. Walk up slow.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Part of the routine. Makes it look like we’re
sizing up the situation. Gives her time to get the wrong impression.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
smoother.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Can I help you gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: How do you do, ma’am, I’m Special Agent
Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your
visitor.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Are you here to make fun of me too?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No ma’am. We at the FBI don’t have a sense of
humor that we’re aware of. Mind if we come in?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Sure. Lemonade?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: And they said to me, “If he was murdered,
how could he walk back in the house?” And I must admit, I was a little
stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn’t him. It was more
like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar
suit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
alien…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
remember.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Sugar water.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Did you taste her lemonade?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Ray Bans. Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien,
and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn’t a UFO. Swamp gas from a
weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light
from Venus –</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
give her a new one?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Standard issue neuralyzer.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And that’s the best you can come up with?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran
off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother’s for a few days and
get over it. Decide you’re better off.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, and you’re better off ’cause he never
appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he’s
gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or
something…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey. Kay…when am I gonna get one of those
memory things?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: When you’re ready. Please – not green.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Do you know what alien life form leaves a green
spectral trail?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Wait – don’t tell me – that was the question on
Final Jeopardy last night.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Zed, we have a bug.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m gonna jump way past you and just guess that
this is bad. Right?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger. They consume,
infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other
species.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So basically you have a racial problem with all
insect-based life forms?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Listen, kid – imagine a giant cockroach five
times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine
times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in
his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Sorry I’m late. The cab drivers on this
planet are terrible.</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: Your majesty, you are in grave
danger.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: Yeah, and they overcharge you every
time.</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you
off the planet.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: A bug? He must know why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: We think he does. Is that what I think
it is?</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: No, just some diamonds for your children.
Do we have time to eat?</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Table six is up!</p>
<p><strong>arquillian</strong>: To the continued reign of the Arquillian
Empire.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: To the safety of the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>rosenberg</strong>: You can kill us both – but you will not
find it.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’re right about one thing.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What am I supposed to do with the cat?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I don’t know. Send it with the stiff. Let
family claim it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Where do you want contestant number three?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: By the wall, I guess. What’s with the
cat?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Oh, the cat. There’s a problem with the cat.
Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What’s the problem with the cat?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Your problem.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Are you having a bad day, baby? Cheer up.
His is worse.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Okey-dokey. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: …approximately 112 degrees at time of
autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body
temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find
subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described as…well…as
really…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of Public
Health. This is Dr. White.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Yeah, well whoever you are, I’m afraid I’m
going to need to see some ID.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You boys must not have much of a home
life.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We watch the morgues very carefully. You’ve got
something unusual?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’d say so – triple homicide.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: The first corpse was perfectly normal,
except that he was broken in half, but when I opened up the other two –
well, look.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: There’s a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’ll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why
don’t you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: This way, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: This one’s even stranger. I did a full
laparotomy. I started with the lesser curvature of the stomach – though,
if you want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal junction.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I think, uh, we should start at the same place
you did.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Your cat?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Guess it is now. Came in with the
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won’t
mind.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You have very pretty eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Thank-you, but is this really the time to uh –
you know, come on to me?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Hey, just walking the dog. Feel that? Where
the piloric junction would be?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, yes. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Now push that aside. Notice anything
strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Nope. All fine.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Doctor, they’re all missing.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, of course they are. What I’m pointing out
is that there are no pieces of them left. So they’re intact, wherever
they are. That we can be sure of.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Have we met before? I have the strangest
feeling of deja vu.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know, I was just going to ask you the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
But don’t tell that guy. He looks like he’s already under enough stress.
This body is not really a body, but it’s actually some sort of transport
unit for something else altogether. The question is: what?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: By the way, stop me if I’m freaking you
out.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, no…not at all.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You know what I like to do sometimes? When
it’s really late?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
Undead thing goin’ on.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Of the body.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Great body.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: The dead body?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Not a clue.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to sound
too dumb.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Dr. White.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Dr. White. Dr. White.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re up, Slugger.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Far – freaking – out.</p>
<p><strong>baltian</strong>: Must – to pre – prevent – – contest? No…to
prevent –</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s all right – What are you trying to say?
Struggle?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: War?</p>
<p><strong>baltian</strong>: Galaxy on – or – or – Orion’s – What is
word? Be…?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Bed? Belt? Orion’s Belt?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: “To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion’s
Belt?” The hell does that mean? Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever,
come here!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: “Doctor Whatever”? You’re not with the
Department of Public Health, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You knew him?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: One of the few I actually liked. Exiled High
Prince.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I was right – this is an alien life form,
and you’re from some government agency who wants to keep it under
wraps…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: He said “to prevent war, the galaxy is on
Orion’s Belt.”</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: … This make total sense. How else do you
explain New York? The other night I’m in a cab, this guy…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: He said there’s a galaxy on Orion’s Belt? That
makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s what he said. Didn’t he? Right after he
– Oh, for Christ’s sake, you did the flashy thing already.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I’m afraid I’m
going to need to see some ID if you’re going to be in the morgue,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Stop that –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: – that thing probably gives you brain
cancer!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Never hurt her before.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: “Never hurt her before”?! How many times have
you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Couple.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Aren’t you worried about, you know, long term
damage?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Little bit.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What the hell happened to make you such a
callous son of a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I took this job.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, you never flashed me with that thing, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in charge
of the flashy memory thing department.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not while I’m around, Slim.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah, well you’re a menace with that thing…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’ve got two dead aliens in there, and a
deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Doesn’t anybody believe in sleep around
here?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time – a
37-hour day. Give it a few months – you’ll get used to it. Or you’ll
have a psychotic episode.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Here’s Orion; the brightest grouping of stars
in the northern sky… and here’s Orion’s belt –</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s what the little guy was talking about,
“To prevent war, the galaxy’s on Orion’s belt…”</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: There are no galaxies on Orion’s belt. The belt
is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of
stars. You heard wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re attracted to me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>553 fairfield ave./tempe/az</strong>: Whoever Elizabeth Ann
Reston is, she’s lovely. She’s setting a picnic table in her back yard
at the moment, unaware that she’s being watched by an eye in the sky –
just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind him.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Pretty lady…</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You were the guy with the flowers in the photo,
something and you got lost? And she never got those flowers, did
she?]</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Grumpy Guy’s story comes into focus. She ever
get married?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>subject lost</strong>: Kay sits back in the chair and eats a
potato chip morosely. Jay looks at him: “Is this me in thirty years?” A
moment goes by. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Well, it’s better to have loved and lost than
never to have –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Kay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: They’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’ve had twelve jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What do they know that we don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Why do rats desert the ship? Go to Lem Sat IV.
Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Four hundred.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Four thousand.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That’s an Arquillian battle cruiser.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And we’ve got a dead Arquillian prince.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Message coming in.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They sound pissed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Translate that and step on it! Meanwhile get
down to Rosenberg’s store and see what you can turn up.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: And Kay – take a lot of fire power.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Series four de-atomizer.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Here. We call this the “Noisy Cricket.”</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a
“Noisy Cricket?!” I’m afraid I’m going to break it.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: That’s my truck!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: And make sure you tell them that at the
impound.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I got worse.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
jewels?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Someone who’s not looking for jewels.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: This guy had a serious crush on his cat.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Kay! GET DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
from the picture! That’s him!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We do not discharge our weapons in view of the
public.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There’s an
Alien Battle Cruiser that’s gonna blow-up the world if we don’t…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: There’s always an Alien Battle Cruiser…or a
Korlian Death Ray, or…an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on
this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their
hopeful little lives is that they don’t know about it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t worry about the bug. He’s not leaving
town. We’ve got his ship.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Zed, we’re gonna need a containment crew down
here at McDougal, south of Houston.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The
exodus continues. It’s like the party’s over and the last one to leave
gets stuck with the check.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You sorry little ingrates!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What about the Arquillians?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: We’ve only translated a part of the message so
far: “Deliver the Galaxy.”</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No, they don’t want much, do they?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Oh, it gets better… They’re holding us
responsible.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Another contestant has entered the ring.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We need help. A professional.
Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope
the little prick hasn’t skipped town.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Where do you keep your dead?</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: I don’t have any dead.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Where?!</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: I don’t know, the city morgue!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Of course that guy’s an alien. That’s gotta be
the worst disguise I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: You don’t like it, you can kiss my
furry little butt.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You busy, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: Sorry, Kay, I can’t talk right now,
my ride’s leaving in –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Call the pound. We got a stray.</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: Hey! Get your paws off me!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The, uh…dog owes my friend some money.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: I know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not a thing?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn’t
some two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of a galaxy. They thought
he would be safe here on earth.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: And the bug had other plans.</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: The galaxy is the best source for
subatomic energy in the universe. If the bugs get their slimy claws on
it, kiss the Arquillians goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Ask him about the belt.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
“Orion’s belt.” What’s he talking about, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: Beats me.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They’re rehearsing a ventriloquist act.</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: The galaxy is here.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and
planets? How’s it here?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: You humans, when’re you gonna learn
that size doesn’t matter? Just ’cause something’s important, doesn’t
mean it’s not very, very small.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: How small?</p>
<p><strong>frank the pug</strong>: Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a
jewel. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to be walked before the
flight.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Get out of here. The galaxy’s here. It’s not on
Orion’s belt.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Kay…</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Boy, when you want attention –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: “Orion.” That’s a pretty name.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: So two galaxies have been fighting for years.
And the only people who’ve been benefiting are a race of creatures
called bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make peace…and the bugs
send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
galaxy they’ve been fighting about.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And if we don’t get it back before he leaves
the planet…we’re history.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’re not even history. ’Cause history implies
there’s someone around to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Thank you for making sure the bell works.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What’s up, Farmer John?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: A man came in here earlier. A dead man.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And this means what to me?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that
means worlds to me. I would like it back.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’ll need a picture ID, written proof of
ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with –</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: – the deceased.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Don’t – do that.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’ll handle this one, you wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What the hell for?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Because all we have to do is walk in and get a
cat, it’s not that hard. But if you go in, you’re gonna lay your Jack
Webb on her and flash your brain ray in her face and she’s gonna end up
with leukemia or some shit. The woman’s a doctor, she doesn’t need you
erasing half her med school classes. Take me five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Two minutes!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Where is the animal?!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I told you, I don’t know, it ran under some
equipment! Over there.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Get it!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hello? Anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Uh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I’m Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
precinct. They brought a cat in here with a corpse the other day, might
have said “Orion” on the cat’s name tag?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Yes. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Right, well, the cat is, uh – the cat’s a
witness in a murder case and I’m going to need to take it with me.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I don’t know where the cat is at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: No. Maybe you could take me with you
instead.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I said, maybe you could take me with you
instead.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Damn, you do start fast, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I’d really like to go with you. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And, uh, why exactly is that?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I just do.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: I have something I need to show you.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Now slow down, you don’t have to hit the gas
like that.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You don’t understand. You really need to see
this.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: And I will. But we gotta get something straight
here – I’m gonna drive. It’s not some kind of macho trip, it’s just the
way I’m used to doing things, okay?</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Look, Stud, I don’t know how many more times
I’m going to get to tell you this. There’s something –</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: – that you have to help me with.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Freeze it, Bug!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: CHRIST, are you THICK!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: How was I supposed to know!?!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What did I have to do, SING it for
you!?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Maybe if you didn’t come on like a drunken prom
date!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Oh, that’s SO typical. Any time a woman
shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just –</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Everybody shut UP!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Let her go, Shit Eater.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I’m
the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re breakin’ my heart. Move six inches to
your left and I’ll solve all your problems.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: That’s better. Now put down your weapons.
We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Would you care to see the fly get even?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: How far you think you’ll get without your ship?
If that’s what you call that hunk of space crap we’ve got back at our
office.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Put the weapons down!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Never gonna happen, Insect.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s okay, Laurel!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: HOW is it okay?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I mean it’s going to be okay!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Don’t bet on it, meat sack.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Take me here.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: They’re in a cab.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey! Laurel!? Hey!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Stop wasting time. He’s not getting off the
planet in a cab.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
around Manhattan; if it’s not human, it’s not leaving the island.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What’ve we got from our friends upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Same thing: “Deliver the galaxy.”</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Yeah, well the bug’s got the galaxy, but we’ve
got his ship. He’s got to be looking for a way out.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an
ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to
respond.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: A galactic standard week? How the hell long is
that?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: One hour.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: One hour?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: To keep the bugs from getting it, the
Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet it’s on.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re talking about US!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Sucks, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Pull up the locations of all land-based
interstellar vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: They’re all gone. Frank the Pug took the last
ship on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Atlantic City?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That landfill on the Jersey Shore?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Uh, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Epcot?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Miami Beach?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Fellas.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hartford?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Gone, thank God.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey. Old guys.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Do those still work?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You’re coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: What?! Why?!</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: It’s a long trip. I’ll need a snack.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Whaddya say we bag us some bug?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re taking the tunnel?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You know a better way to Queens?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: It’s usually jammed?!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I told you!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Jay. The button?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Yeah?!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Push the button, Jay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: And you may want to throw on a seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mind if I smoke?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: In the car, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: I don’t care!!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers some
people if you smoke in a car.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Yeah, it’s harder and harder to smoke anywhere
these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I’ve tried. Never took,
though. I’m beginning to think I lack self-control.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Well, back to work.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Come on, let me go, you don’t want to eat
me. I’m a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess,
even. There are those who worship me, yes. I’m not trying to impress you
with this, I’m just letting you know. It could start a war.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Good. War means food for my family, all
seventy-eight million of them. That’s a lot of mouths to feed, your
highness.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: You’re a wonderful dad.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You know how to work that?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No idea whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Let’s bag us some bug.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
implosion factor –</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Press the little green button, on three.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: One…two…</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You don’t get it. I’ve won. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You are under arrest for violating number
4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand over any galaxy you might be
carrying.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You milk-suckers! You don’t matter! In a few
seconds you won’t even be matter!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Move away from the vehicle and put your hands
on your head.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Put my hands on my head?</p>
<p><strong>bug</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That did not go at all like I had planned.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This guy’s really starting to bug me.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Whatever happens, Jay, don’t let him get on
that ship.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Getting my gun back.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hey, Bug!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’m talking to you, Bug! You know how many of
your kind I’ve swatted with a newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re just a smear on the sports page to me,
you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey! Come over here and try that!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Stop right there, or I’ll start wailing on your
waxy, pointed ass!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand and
fight like an arthropod!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe you’re a
badass in your hive, but this is New York City. You’re just another
tourist here!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You’re messing with the wrong species, Bug
–</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Hey, Bug!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: If I’m not mistaken, that was a cousin of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d’you know,
here’s your old Uncle Bob!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: What’s that? Can you hear what he’s saying?
‘Help me! Help me!’</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Ooh! There’s a pretty one. That one looks kinda
familiar, don’t you think? I know who that is!</p>
<p><strong>bug</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: That’s your Momma!</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Didn’t she ever teach you not to bite off more
than you can chew?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You son of a –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians. We have
the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I think the word’s already out. Our friends are
coming back. Got an authorized landing at Times Square. You and Jay
check it out on the way back… And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
while you’re at it. Extra salt. I feel like celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Worked.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: After I got the shit beat out of me!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: And I almost got digested. It goes with the
job.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: You coulda told me what you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: There wasn’t time, sport!</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Interesting job you guys got.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Damn bugs.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
bust the Bug for us. And so maybe you don’t have to flashy thing
her.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Who’s she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs
out with dead people.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Not her. Me. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?
The stars. I never just look anymore and they’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Kay, you’re scaring your partner.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I haven’t been training a partner – I’ve been
training a replacement.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: Oh no, I can’t do this job by myself.</p>
<p><strong>laurel</strong>: Hey, guys, we’re nowhere near my apartment.
We’re not even on the right island.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Maybe you won’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Days. Months. Years. Always face it
forwards.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’ve just been down the gullet of an
interstellar cockroach. That’s one of a hundred memories I don’t
want.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: See you around, sport.</p>
<p><strong>jay</strong>: No, you won’t.</p>
