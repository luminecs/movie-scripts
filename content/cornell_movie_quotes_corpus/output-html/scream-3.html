<p><strong>ben</strong>: God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap!
I’m supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right Now, arm and arm with
my girlfriend cause she’s got a bit part in that over advertised piece
of shit and I’m just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that in all
your squandering the best you can do for me is A bit role in STAB 3:
RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on! It’s just another cheap slasher flick!
How dare you offer me such a role! I’ve done Shakespeare! I’ve worked
with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap?!
It’s insulting. I should fire you and go to ICM.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Ben, I will not sit around and listen to you
bad mouth me! Without me you would’ve never gotten as famous as you are
today. The least you can do is show me a little god damn respect.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You want Respect, Cathy? Here’s your respect.
FUCK YOU! You’re fired. Unfucking believable.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro. Pah. What’s next,
Friday The 13TH PART 15:</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s up, B.D. with the B.D.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hardly as large as I’d like it to
be.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Christine?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it’s
me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by
myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, I’m stuck on the freeway. I think there
was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don’t want you to
start freaking if I don’t get there at exactly, Eight thirty.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: All I’m saying is I’m gonna be royally
p.o.’d if you don’t catch my acting debut.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh I wouldn’t miss it for the world. I bet you
did such a great job.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I did. Hon, although I got a total of six
minutes screen time, they’re the best six minutes of the movie.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are.
Look, my battery’s dying . . .</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Alright Hon, talk to you when the lights
go down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jesus. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well what number are you trying to reach?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I think you got the wrong number, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out.
Really wish I could chat, but I can’t so, later.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wait, wait. Don’t hang up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Asshole, Can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: But your voice sounds so familiar.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Does it now?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You almost sound like that guy from THERE’S
SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well ya got me. That’s me. I’m Ben Damon.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Really? You’re such a talented actor.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now let’s see you act your way out of this
one.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I mean, I’m standing right outside the LADIES
ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.
She’s all alone. Everyone’s in the auditorium waiting for the film to
start. I’ve got my knife.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: At this point we intercut shots of the empty
lobby and halls of the PLAZA THEATER. A POV shot standing outside the
LADIES ROOM door.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a
joke?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: More of a game really.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of a game?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies.
Here’s how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your
girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I’ll
fucking kill you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Maybe so, but right now, we play the game.
First question, Your girlfriend’s counting on you, Name your
girlfriend’s character in STAB 2?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Come on. Don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s CICI! Cici’s the name of the character she
plays in the movie!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?! But I did everything you said to do!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we’re
taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign
in ten minutes. I’ll have your girlfriend. We’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Good bye Ben.</p>
<p><strong>recorded message</strong>: Due to the high volume of calls
this evening, Dispatch is temporarily shut down. If this is not a real
emergency please call another dep-</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re not playing by the rules Ben. Don’t
you want her to live?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No! You listen to me, if you’re not where I
want you in fifteen minutes I’ll hollow her out. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank God I decided to do some community
service.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Very good. You follow directions well. Now
for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign,
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Closer than you think.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Alright I’m here. What the fuck do you want
from me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: To see your reaction.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Reaction to what?</p>
<p><strong>the ghost</strong>: You just lost the role Ben. Consider this
your parting gift.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Good morning Hollywood. And today officially
starts the Summer movie season. Opening the box office this week is Jeff
Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street, Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs
in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in STAB 2,
based off my best selling book the WINDSOR MURDERS.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed
to the occasion. Today we have director of the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN
TO WOODSBORO, Roman Bridger. Why don’t we give Mr. Bridger a nice
welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It’s a pleasure to finally meet you,
Roman.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Well it’s a honor to be here amongst so many
fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry
Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have
no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I
believe we’re going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems
that way. Honestly though, tell us, what’s your favorite scary
movie?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Honestly, my life.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Your life?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with
those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis,
you’d watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a
Tobe Hooper flick.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Would you excuse me for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I’m sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me
to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D. Are you familiar with the
actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He
was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins,
she had a part in Stab 2, didn’t she? She was playing CICI.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Both of them were found brutally
murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having
come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the
Stab films.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: So is that why you’re here? Is that why you’re
holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I’m not
even involved in?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I wish that was all Miss
Weathers, but there’s more. The killer left a note.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: A note?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: That’s Sidney Prescott’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: There’s more.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I’ve tried to get in touch with
Sidney Prescott, but she’s keeping herself very well hidden. You’re my
one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I’d love to help, really I wouldn’t mind being
sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don’t know
where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth.
The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: And who would that be?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey Dew, did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No, what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Somebody iced Ben Damon and his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: That’s Hollywood Tom. One day you’re making
movies in the hills, the next day you’re posing for the coroner downtown
on a slab.</p>
<p><strong>sarah darling</strong>: 30, playing a 25 year old bimbo. Very
hot. Very blonde. Ample cleavage.</p>
<p><strong>angelina tyler</strong>: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won
her part in STAB 3 playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest.
She’s timid, with short dark hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the
closet to Sidney, they got.</p>
<p><strong>tyson jackson</strong>: late 20’s, African-American, all
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these
re-writes. It’s like every five minutes there’s a new script. God, and
you just know this all because of STAB 2’s script winding up on the
internet two months after it wrapped shooting.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: And still the film is Number One at the box
office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Nah I think it’s doing so damn well because
one of it’s players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: Oh that’s right. Those poor poor people.
God Ben Damon was such a hottie.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: And that CICI chick wasn’t that bad either
but I’m really concerned about my safety now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What are you talking about? The murders were
a completely isolated incident.</p>
<p><strong>scene 32. int. candy’s living room - night.</strong>: “What
are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated
incident”.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Would you give that script a rest? It’s like
a friggen umbilical cord to you.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: I’m just saying, though. What if there’s
someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: There’s always someone out there stalking
actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Melinda McGraw?</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: No, the other one. The one who played his
wife.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know who you’re talking about. Rebecca
something.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: Yeah I think. Anyway, point is, she had a
stalker. Sonny Bono had a stalker. David Letterman had one too. So did
Heather Langenkamp, Brooke Sheilds, Jody Foster, –</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Listen Miss ing�nue, your cheering me up to
much, Give it a break.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What? What’d I do? Relax your crack sweetheart
I didn’t rip those two fucks up last night. Jeez. So what are you doing
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Talk about moody.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And how about you good looking? Got any plans
for later?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Eww yeah, finding a guy to have sex with that
doesn’t look like you.</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Oh no. I ain’t into that shit.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: D�jr vu-do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well well, someone dies and Gale Weathers
comes running. What a shock.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark
Kincaid. I’m with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night’s Events?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Yeah. A real tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is
about Sidney. We need to know where she is.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What so you can just exploit her again with
another book? Sid doesn’t need you Gale.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Show him.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Mr. Rielly, this was found
alongside the bodies of Ben and his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I promised Sid I’d keep her in seclusion. I
promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don’t mind Detective,
I’d like to approach her with this on my own and see what she’d like to
do about it.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: That’s fine Mr. Rielly, but if
anyone else should die, I’m going to have to get a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Understood. If you’ll excuse me Detective.
Gale.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I’m going to have a little chat
with the producers. Don’t wander off. I may need you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I can assure you that security on the set
will be at an all time high. Again, the deaths are sheer tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Well, I’d hate to see the
production shut down. I myself am a big STAB fan.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Really? Have you ever thought about acting?
You’ve got just the right face.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I am kind of dedicated to my job.
Although I do enjoy taking acting classes on my weekends. I grew up
around these studios anyway. I know my way around. My Uncle was a
screenwriter for PARAMOUNT.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Really, what was his name?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Excuse me Detective, I think we have some
business to attend to.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No
press on the set! No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>security gaurd</strong>: Yes, Mr. Milton.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: No, Mr. Milton, Miss Weathers is
with me.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Well then, I guess I’ll be leaving then.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh come on! Why the hostility?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all
but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my
wife left me because I’m a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year
old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about
bringing to your superior’s attentions.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: They’re the ones who approved it.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Alright Kincaid, no where to?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I go to the police station and do
my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick
around.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Look, Miss Weathers, if there’s a
problem, give me a call. Here’s my card. I’m always there.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Shit. Can I even get a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: This is Laura in Monterey reporting in for
work.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Alright Laura I’ll patch you right in to a
call.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yes, hi I’m Laura, I’m a trained counselor.
How can I help you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Laura I think I just killed somebody.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Uh-huh I’m sure. I’ve killed someone!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Well then the people you need to call are
the police.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No I need to call you. Just you.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I’m sorry, your voice.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Don’t you want to know how you can help,
Sidney? Are you listening to me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and
turn on the news. DO IT!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The mutilated bodies were discovered late
last night by the L.A.P.D, prominent actor Ben Damon was slated for a
role in the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do you think it’s over Sidney? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: W-what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I want to finish what I started. I want to
finish the game.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You sick fuck I’m tracing this call as we
speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Let them try. You’ll never find me. I’ve
already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen
Prescott.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No. You didn’t kill my mother. Billy Loomis
and Stu Macher did.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It’s
all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce
of blood that’s been spilled has all been leading up to this moment.
WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: The final act? Well let’s play asshole!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. We play in my court this time. Come to
Hollywood. STAB 3’s going to cutting corners cast-wise. And I’ve got my
eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: If you lay a hand on him I’ll fucking kill
you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Great. A spirited one. I’ll be seeing you
real soon Sidney. Real soon.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: STAB 3. Oh God I’ve gotta get myself a better
agent.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Doubt that. Anyone here?</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Stan! My man does great work.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fuck you very much! Tyson go to hell! What
the hell are you doing here? Where’s Roman?</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: Roman and everybody else went home for the
night. I’m here for a make-up test.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Make-up. You need it. Hey, Roman isn’t
here?</p>
<p><strong>tyson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Damn. He called my roommate and told her he
had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah I bet.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For the honorary field of directing and
cinematography in music videos. How to the point.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh shit. Hello? Director’s office.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Sarah, it’s Roman, I’m sorry I’m running
late, I’m still on the 405, I’m about 10 minutes away.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh it’s no problem, I’m just… looking at your
music video awards.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: All right, since I got you on the phone,
let’s talk about your character.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What character? I’m Candy, the chick who gets
killed second. I’m only in two scenes!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: You’re not happy with your part.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not happy that I’m 35 playing a 21 year
old. I’m not happy that I have to die naked! And I’m not happy that my
character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her
boyfriend’s been cut into McNuggets.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Um hmm… umhmm great, so let’s run the
lines.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Huh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Page 22, Candy’s big moment.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Page 22.. Ring ring. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This is Candy. Hang on, let me get some
clothes. See! I don’t’ understand why I have to start the scene in the
shower! The whole shower things been done, ‘Vertigo’ hello! And I mean,
my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Why don’t we just read the scene? Candy, is
that like candy cane or candy apple?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Whatever. Come on, who is this? I think you
have the wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: But you know my favorite name?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m hanging up right now.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: It’s Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Roman that’s not the line.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: It is in my script.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How
the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there’s a new script
every 15 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: It’s not just a new script, it’s a new
movie.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What? What movie?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: My movie.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s called, Sarah gets sliced like a fucking
pig. Still in character, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Mr. Bridger?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! No! Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: That’s STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It
looks like we’re going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss
Prescott anyway.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too.
God, it’s happening again isn’t it Detective?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Yes well we have a suspect, so
don’t get that worried.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I’m not at liberty to tell you
that Miss Weathers. You’re no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don’t
even know why you’re standing in here right now. By all means I should
have you thrown out.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: But you won’t. You’re a good man detective. We
think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: In my fifteen years as a homicide
detective I’ve never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are
Miss Weathers.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Please, call me Gale.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Deal, but I’m still Detective
Kincaid,ok?</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Mark, Bridger’s in custody. We
traced his phone records. He’s the last person to speak to Sarah Darling
before she died. Or at least call her home.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Wait a minute, Roman’s your suspect?</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Listen, Diane Sawyer, this here
is classified information. Why don’t you go investigate the bad meat at
the A.P. This is police work, not Pulitzer material.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Hey, fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: No, cool it Wallace. She’s
working with me.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Well then. Looks like I’ll go
dust for finger prints with Barbara Walters.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: So, what now?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Mr. Bridger, you didn’t tell us
you spoke with Sarah Darling before she died.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: That’s because I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: The guard said she was there for
a meeting with you.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: What meeting?</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: We talked to her roommate, too.
Says you called Sarah and told her to come down to the studio. Roommate
answered the phone, says it was you.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Wait a minute! I never called her! I never
told her to go anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Roommate says she knows your
voice, Mr. Bridger.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Well, she wasn’t speaking with me! Look, I
did not call Sarah Darling!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Sarah Darling said you did.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Someone is trying to ruin my movie. Someone
wants to kill my movie!</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Hey, look at it this way, if
anything this’ll be something interesting to put on the director’s
commentary for when the film hits DVD.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Ha! Too late, studio’s shutting down
production. Called my film a risk! Do you believe this shit? They’re
actually shelving my film because there’s been one ensie little murder.
God, three people died during the filming of The Exorcist.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Well I doubt they were stabbed to
death and I strongly doubt the killer of them left messages on the scene
for the police to find.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: They found another note?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one
about Sid’s mom. Dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we’re
going to have to go back into our past.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has
nothing to do with you Gale.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was
the one who brought the nation’s attention to this shit anyway. I’ll be
damned if I’m gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Do you really mean it this time Gale?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Yes. Look, let’s get something straight Dewey,
I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I’m
out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Why would the police come to you?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Again, I am the author of the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.! What about you?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You said you’d never leave Woodsboro, ‘The
only place that’s real!’ But now you’re here. Not with me. Dewey, I took
care of you. I waited until you were well. I couldn’t stay there, I
mean, it’s like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven
everywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: So it’s off to London for a week? New York
for a month? L.A Forever?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It was fucking ‘60 Minutes II’! I couldn’t say
no! I could’ve been the next Diane Sawyer!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What’s wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I
liked her!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It didn’t work Dewey. We tried, we’re
different.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: You used to say that was our strength.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey, you’re not just here because of that
second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually
not About you.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: All of what Dewey? You do know something,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Off the record.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a
call from a woman who said she was with ‘Stab 3’. She wanted to see the
file on Sid, for research.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: The boys said no. She wouldn’t give her name.
A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room
ransacked.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Someone stole Sid’s file?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I already removed it. I think someone on the
film was trying to find Sid, and that’s the only reason I came here. To
make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one
here was planning anything.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I’m sorry, this is too good!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What part of ‘Off the record’ don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Right. Sorry. Do you think he did it?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’ve got my suspicions but still, nothing you
say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: And who is that?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Jennifer needs me.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off
to?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’m on duty.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Stop following me.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I happen to work for the police god
dammit!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: You’re not a detective.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Neither are you, Magnum P.I.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Gale, your engine’s still running.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Gale Weathers. What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That’s a
shocker.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey I really liked that piece you did on me
last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me
drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my
insurance wouldn’t sky rocket.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Heh, well, that’s TV journalism for ya. Stage
the news to boost ratings.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role
in Roman Polanski’s latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up
by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point?
STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I’m here, drinking
piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer
Jollie and yourself! Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look
at your break line. That your car over there?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I think we should go inside. I have to have a
talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You mean what’s left of us. Yeah I’m running on
empty anyways. Gotta refuel.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You! How can I ever get any fame playing
you!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about
now? What’s wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners
you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God damn you Gale Weathers! Don’t you see?
The killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script! Ben
Damon’s character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend
- but she wasn’t cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah
Darling’s Candy, and now me!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one
there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon
was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It
only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I
die in STAB 3?</p>
<p><strong>and i die naked?! ugh!</strong>: This is complete bullshit.
Who wrote this piece of crap?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I know right. It was kinda weak. That’s
cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was
written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Still that was a much better movie, I saw it
at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked
with this shit for?! We’ve gotta get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: What are you talking about? Because of
this shit I’ll probably never act in a Hollywood film again.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey good looking, if you play your cards right,
I may be able to sit you down on my casting couch and try you out for a
few films my production company is working on. How do you feel about a
DEEP THROAT remake?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Angelina! Hey! Where the hell are you? I was
only playing! Hey look, I can really get you a bit part! Just come on
out! Ok? Damn it. There goes my chances of getting some head from
her.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aaaangelina?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Angelina?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You fucker!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fucker!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Shit! Where the hell are Tom and
Angelina?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I don’t know. Screw them. Look, what’s
important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next
it’s you or me Jen.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What about Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Ssh. Maybe it’s Tom or Angelina. I’ll get
it.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What if it’s the killer?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh use your brain drama queen! Do the killers
ever knock on the fucking door? Ever see Jason do that before burying an
axe in some big titted blonde’s head? Or maybe Michael or Chucky?
Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Don’t worry. I’m prepared for anything.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking
door!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do you smell something?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: It’s Gale. She farts when she gets
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Alright don’t panic! Just a fuse.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Hurry! Everyone out the back way! Now!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Who’s phone?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh shit it’s my cell!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Answer it!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello Jennifer. Wanna play a little game?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s him! It’s the killer!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What’s your favorite scary movie Gale?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I dunno but I can tell you that your’s will be
the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out
and fight like a real man you pussy!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: I just might!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He’s
dead!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: No! He’s not dead! He’s still breathing!
Look!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Gale he’s dead. Come on. Let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Whoever it is, now is taking
credit for Maureen Prescott’s murder.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy
Loomis and Stu Macher. I mean, they even told Sidney how they did
it!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Yeah, but, if I’m not mistaken,
you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused
Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it! Maybe
there is a third killer. Sidney Might know something</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I told you, I don’t know where Sidney is. And
even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn’t know about it.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: That is for me to decide. I need
to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case. I have a
press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four
dead celebrities.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Four? There are five.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Ben Damon. Christine Perkins.
Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That’s four, last time I learned how to
count.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What about Angelina Tyler? She was there
too.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Police are still searching
through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if
she’s even there.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: OK, look. We all know that this has something
to do with ‘Stab 3’. What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving
articles about Maureen Prescott.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Actually, there was more this
time. This time, we found a picture too.</p>
<p><strong>dewey/gale</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Before you jump to conclusions,
the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business.
His alibi checks out. Seems he’s got a TV show in Australia, 100%
COTTON. It’s supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo
Serious, but that’s besides the point.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What does this have to do with Sid?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Well Sid’s dad couldn’t help you and he was
married to Maureen.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: What’s your problem? Last night
you were almost charcoal. You gonna help us or what?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Is that a threat, Detective?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: When it’s a threat, you’ll know
it.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Boys, boys, why don’t we compare our gun
calibers later? The issue is Maureen Prescott!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Wrong, this issue is Sidney
Prescott! And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going
to put me in touch with her. So, where is she?</p>
<p><strong>sidney’s answering machine</strong>: Hi, you’ve reached the
machine. Leave a message, talk as long as you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sid it’s me, this is the sixth time I’ve
called. Please pick up, I wanna make sure you’re Okay. Sid!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What are you doing here? I told you to stay
hidden! It’s not safe for you up here.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Well it’s not safe for me up there either.
The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I figured I’d be safe If I was at least up
here with the people I care about. Now where’s this Kincaid guy the news
is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT.
Heh.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Detective Kincaid?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: What Rielly?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: There’s someone here who wants to help.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?
Hey.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hi, Gale. I’m glad you’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sid, this is detective Kincaid.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Nice to finally meet you,
Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: The killer called her.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: What? When?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh, you know, the usual small talk, “What’s
new, how ya been, how do you want to die?”</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sidney, do you have any idea how he could’ve
gotten your number?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: He could’ve monitored the calls
on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Do you have her number stored in your memory?
Phone memory!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Oh. Yeah, I guess I do.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Has anyone else every used your phone?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Just Jennifer. And you.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Hey, I’m the cop here. You’re in
my office, Riley.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: The killer leaves a newspaper
clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he’s also left a photo of your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me? This is my mother,
Dewey. Why didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya
know, trick you out of hiding.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio
where all this shit’s going down.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3
Production offices. That’s where Sarah Darling was murdered last
night.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my
mother have to do with this all Dewey? We’re a long way from
Woodsboro.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of
me! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Who’s this.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: She was Randy’s only girlfriend . . .
ever.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: That’s me. First and Last.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: It’s been a while? You still working at
Bradley’s?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Nope. They opened up a Hollywood Video down
the street. It pays better. Anyway, I’m here because I heard on the news
about the murders and well, I found this while rooting through Randy’s
things.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Told you I’d make a movie someday, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh MY god.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Well, if you’re watching this tape, it means
as I feared, I did not survive these killings here at Windsor College.
Anyway, the reason I am here is to help you, so that my death will not
be in vain. That my life’s work, will help save some other poor soul
from getting mutilated. If this killer does come back, and he’s for
real, there are a few things that you gotta remember. Is this simply
another sequel? Well, if it is, same rules apply. But, here’s the
critical thing. If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected
backstory, and a preponderance of exposition, then the sequel rules do
not apply. Because you are not dealing with a sequel, you are dealing
with the concluding chapter of a trilogy.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: A trilogy?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: That’s right. It’s a rarity in the horror
field, but it does exist, and it’s a force to be reckoned with, because
true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning and discovering
something that wasn’t true from the get go. ‘Godfather’, ‘Jedi’, all
revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn’t true. So if it
is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules.
One, you got a killer who’s gonna be super human. Stabbing him won’t
work, shooting him won’t work, basically in the third one, you gotta
cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up. Number
two; anyone including the main character can die. This means you, Sid.
I’m sorry, it’s the final chapter. It can be fuckin ‘Reservoir Dogs’ by
the time this thing is through. Number three; the past will come back to
bite you in the ass! Whatever you think you know about the past, forget
it. The past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the
past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER FOUR,Never, ever
under any circumstances go running off by yourself, cause if Friday the
13th has taught us anything, it’s that the next time we’re gonna see
you, you’re gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back. So in
closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, and for some of you, I’ll see
you soon, cause the rules say, some of you ain’t gonna make it. I
didn’t, not if you’re watching this tape.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thanks Karen. You be careful.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Don’t worry Sid. I got tickets to see Family
Feud. I did have a somewhat ulterior motive for driving all the way down
here.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I’ve got an idea, I’ll hook up with you guys
later.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Do you want us to come with you?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I work better alone. Why don’t you do some
snooping around the set?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I can see nothing’s changed.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Geez.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I am Gale Weathers!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Here’s how I see it. I’ve got no house, no
movie, no gun, and I’m being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where
you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I’ll be with you, and
since they really want to kill you, they won’t kill me, they’ll kill
you. Make sense?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You know in the movies, I play you as
being much smarter.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: And as a sane person. For you that must be
quite a stretch.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Need to get in that building?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: No really?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: There a story in that building?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Gale Weathers would find a way.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Basements creep me out.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Really, you know you’d make a fascinating
interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Look who’s talking Moneybags. You got more
homes than I do.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It’d put a
smile on my face everytime I’m down.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I’m Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and
Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe
you’ve heard of me?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I don’t watch TV and I hate books. Whatta
you need?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar
to you?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well can you tell me if the woman in this
picture looks familiar to you.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Listen, I’m busy. Nobody has access to those
files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well if you won’t work for me, will you work
for the president?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: The president . . . of the studio.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Twenty dollars? Who are you Nancy
Drew?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Go ahead. It’s worth three grand easy. My
Gale Weather’s will stop at nothing to get the story.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: I know every face in here, respect for the
unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you’re looking for Maureen
Prescott –</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It may be Maureen Reynolds –</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Well you’ll find neither. Rina Reynolds,
however, You will.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Rina Reynolds. What a stage name.</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You should talk, Judy Jurgenstein.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What are these movies? ‘Amazombies’, ‘Space
Psychos’ ‘Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault’?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton’s
heyday.</p>
<p><strong>gale/jennifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bianca</strong>: You know, JOHN MILTON, the horror producer?
Those were some of his early flicks.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Listen Dewey I have to go to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean,
remember what Randy said?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No I’ll be ok. I’ve got my mace. My knife.
These two lethal weapons.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Sure you don’t need a police
escort? That’s what we’re here for.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No really, I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: H-hello? Anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ve got a permit for it.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to
kill me in the bathroom! The killers!</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Wait a second? Killers? There’s
two of them now? Aw shit!</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Yeah this is Wallace. We got a
problem down here on the Sunrise Studios lot. No not another one. At
least not yet. Yeah we’ve had an attack. Do you need medical assistance?
No. Oh really. Alright, see you in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Well I got some good news in a
way. Roman Bridger didn’t make those calls To Sarah Darling. Police let
him go. Here’s the bad news: The cellular was cloned, it’s untraceable.
We now have no suspects.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dew!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Sidney, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Nevermind, what’d you two find?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: We did some researching in the archives. Sid,
something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother’s murder.
For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared
off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We’ve found out where she went.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: She was an actress Sidney. Minor B-Movies. But
now we have a new suspect in this twisted fucking web . . . John
Milton.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: The head of the studio?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It makes sense doesn’t it? It’s his big
grandiose swan song from the genre. What a better way to end than with a
bloodbath?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sidney, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I was attacked in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Wallace, shouldn’t you be investigating the
bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: I’m waiting for back-up. I don’t
carry bullets in my gun unless I know I’m gonna use em.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Jesus Christ Sidney, what
happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone
was attacked.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: And what made you think it was Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Sid, get in my car. You’re coming
back to the station with me where it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey, Jennifer, I think we should pay John
Milton a little visit.</p>
<p><strong>dewey/jennifer</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Roman I know you’re upset. But there will be
other movies. I know. Ah, VARIETY called you a Pariah? Well fuck them. I
got a great script on my desk. It’s called TRAGIC MENAGE TRIOS and it
was written by John Sayles. I’m thinking you for Director. What? Come
in. No, not to you Roman. Look I’ll talk to you later. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: So you knew Sidney Prescott’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Just what the hell do you people think
you’re doing, barging in here like this? I’ve got important calls to
make. I run this studio.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Answer the question. You knew Sidney’s
mom?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Rina Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Do you know how many actors have worked for
me? Hundreds, thousands.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Nobody said she was an actor.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Good twist.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: No point, I’m just gonna give Detective
Kincaid a call.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I remember her! She was a bit player in a
couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh, Come on! You have made millions off
the story of her murder. You’re obsessed with HER and you’re obsessed
with her DAUGHTER!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Settle down Beavis. Why don’t you tell us the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: What the hell are you guys getting at? I
make horror films, that’s what I do. The Studio came to me with ‘Stab’.
They came to me, check it out.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: But you know who she was.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: When we did the first ’Stab” I realized I’d
known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn’t tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: And now? I mean, murders on your set and still
you say nothing?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Get real, that would make me a suspect!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Just because you knew her?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I don’t think so! Just what happened to
Maureen when she was in Hollywood?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go.
It’s dead and buried. Daddy took ol’ Yeller out behind the barn and shot
him in the head a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug
up and drug all over National TV? Why don’t you start talking.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It was in the 70’s, everything was
different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It
was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if
they made the right impression. Nothing happened to her that she didn’t
invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Are you saying she was-</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I’m saying things got out of hand. Maybe
they did take advantage of her!. Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the
city for innocence. No charges were brought. And the bottom line is,
Rina Reynolds wouldn’t play by the rules. You wanna get ahead in
Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What do you know about trilogies?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: You mean like, movie
trilogies?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You seem to like movies, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Call me Mark, would you? Cause
I’m gonna keep calling you Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I’ll call you Mark when you catch the
killer, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: All I know about movie trilogies
is in the third one, all bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Did you request this case?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: No, they tend to put me on the
ones that deal with the business. I grew up here, and I know my way
around the studios.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful
people.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: To me Hollywood is about
death.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I’m a homicide detective,
remember? When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that
people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about
that.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: I know what it’s like to see
ghosts that don’t Go away. To be watching a scary movie in your head,
whether you want to or not, watching it alone.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Ghosts are tough, you can’t shoot
ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Can’t arrest ghosts. But the best
way to stop being haunted is to be with people. You’re here, you’re not
hiding, you’ve done the right thing, Miss Prescott.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: What did you know about your
mother?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I used to think I had the perfect mom,
perfect family. Till I found out I was wrong. She had a secret life, and
I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets. I
don’t’ know who my mom was. Sometimes I feel like I’m just learning
about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies
and what not. God sometimes I feel like I’m just learning about myself
for the first time. Like I’m watching my life instead of living in
it.</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Here’s the deal, I’m off to
search the soundstage. That’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: How is that good news?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Because, that means that we’re
dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. And I know how to
handle guys like that.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh yeah, how?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Catch him, or kill him.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hey Detective? What’s your favorite scary
movie?</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: My life.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Mine too.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh God Gale, Dewey was right. Stop getting
so nervous and you might stop causing me to gag!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think Milton’s the killer. I think he
just went out to kill another cast member.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Milton’s not a killer. He’s a pervert. He
probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has
with his two best friends.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you
did play me for three movies. His two hands, dingus.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Ssh ladies.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: John Milton.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wanna play a game?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You tell me. You bankrolled three movies
about me.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s you. The saboteur whose been fucking up
my movie! I swear to God if you don’t stop I’ll find you and have you
killed! I shut down production on that piece of shit STAB 3! We had a no
talent director and the lousiest Sidney Prescott on the planet but that
was besides the point! You still killed MY movie! A John Milton film!
And if you ever try and cross me again you’ll be sorry. My next movie is
gonna be a grandiose step up from this slasher shit! It’s a film written
and directed by John Sayles.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh poor John. There’s not gonna be another
film. Well, at least not for you.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Hold on Gale, I’m a pro at this.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh Dewey I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Here. Let me –</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Excuse me Gale! What the hell do you think
you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Let’s get this drawer open. If it’s locked,
there must be something inside he’s trying to hide.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Shit. That’s gonna leave a mark.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What? What’d you find?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you’re
never going to believe who Milton’s kid is.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Guys! I got a bad feeling.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Guys there’s someone else in the fucking
room!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Gale run!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Jesus Gale what happened?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He killed Milton! The killer’s inside there!
Oh God! DEWEY! Dewey’s in there too! He needs medical help! He’s
hurt!</p>
<p><strong>detective kincaid</strong>: Alright, calm down. I’m going to
radio in for backup right now.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not so fast. We’re not finished.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I wouldn’t run if I were you Gale. It’s only
gonna end up with you getting Skewered like a fucking pig. I need
you.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Awfully late time to be doing an
interview.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I need you as bait. For Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sidney’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>phone sidney</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Um wh-who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>phone sidney</strong>: Um wh-who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back, I
can only hear myself.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: { a click } I only her you too, Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The question isn’t who I am. The question is,
who’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Sidney, stay away!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t do it! If you do one thing to attract
attention, one thing, I’ll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we
can be alone?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Go there.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Always hard being friends with you, Sidney.
When you’re friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don’t have
to, Sidney. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: How do I know their voices are –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are real? How do you know you’re not hearing
things? How do you know I’m not someone in your head? Somewhere, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Don’t come here Sidney!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Dewey! No!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Or do you?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t want them, I want you! It’s simple.
You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh God! Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t you want to know Sidney? Don’t you want
to know who killed her? Don’t you want to know who killed your
mother?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Have you seen Kincaid?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: NO. But Wallace is around.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: She’d have been so happy, Sidney, to know
we’d be together.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll call you, when you’re on your way.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You follow directions good. Now let’s wrap
this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I’ll call you when
you get there.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Alright, I’m here. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re doing real good. Can’t you figure it
out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I thought you wanted me here?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Alright I’m here, now show your face so we
can finish this.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s good to see you again Sidney. I was
growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I’ll catch up with you
later.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Help me Sid! The killer’s got me!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sid I can see you!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Where are you Dewey?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: I’m out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The
killer’s looking for you! Quick untie me!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Good work Sid.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: You play a good game Sidney. Now it’s time to
get down to business.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Your other half.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Christ Sidney hurry up! That fucking lunatic
is coming!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Gale he’s got Dewey!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I know! He killed Kincaid!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Jesus Christ Sidney get out of here! He can’t
get us both!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Dewey!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Where’s Gale?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: They’ve got her!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Sid I want you to stay here! I’ll be right
back! I’m not gonna let them get Gale!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Hold it right there you fucker!</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: OH shit!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: Time to sort things out. Whatta you
say?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: It’s you?! All of this is because of
you?</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: No. Not all of it. Sid, someone really
wants to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: Uh-un Sid. You’re not gonna run off. Not
now.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re not going anywhere Sidney. It’s time
you came to terms with me, and with mother! Maybe you never knew her at
all, Sid. Maybe you can’t get past the surface of things.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>the ghost</strong>: The other half of you! I searched for a
mother too, an actress named Rina Reynolds. I tried to find her my whole
life. And four years ago I actually tracked her down, knocked on her
door, thinking she’d welcome me back with open arms, but she had a new
life and a new name, Maureen Prescott! You were the only child she
claimed Sidney. She shut me out in the cold forever, her own son!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Roman Bridger, director. And brother. She
slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina’s child and Rina was
dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a
little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got
around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that,
but Billy’s father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn’t like seeing
his daddy in my movies. Didn’t like it at all. And once I supplied the
motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell
out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was
making a movie.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: All the nightmares. All the hell I went
through was because of you, you spineless bastard!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: I’m a director Sid, I direct. For example,
Angelina over there, She’s my partner. I can convince her to do
anything. We’ve been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English
class?</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: That’s me Sid. I always idolized you. You
were always my hero. That’s why I’m here Sidney. I wanted to make you
proud.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: And I kinda keep her around cause it’s a bit
of a turn-on. You know, in the movies she’s you Sid, so every time I
jump her bones, I’m doing YOU, technically.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Listen, I have no time for this. I’ve heard
this shit before! So lets get on with it!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Wait a second Sid. Don’t you go jumping the
gun. You haven’t seen the best part. With the aides of the computer
revolution of y2kI’ve been able to steal your voice. Ain’t it cool?
Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless,
mutilated body.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I can’t take it anymore. This Hollywood
exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to
make you all repent for your sins, and now I’m pleased I’ve got my
message across. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Awesome. What’d I tell ya? Heh. Did youknow
that John Milton, was my daddy? Yep, he’s the one who fucked mommy
dearest in the long run. His parties, his flings, exploited the
Hollywood nobody! That’s whyI had to make him pay. Daddy dearest is
dead. Mommy’s dead. Looks like I’m an orphan all alone in this world.
What a good reason to –</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: See Sidney, as amateur as Billy and Stu were,
they laid the groundwork for this! See Sidney, they also set the stage
for you! Introducing to the world Sidney the victim! Sidney the
survivor! Sidney the star!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: See Sid, now comes the part where we get away
with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the
bad guys win!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Roman knock it off! Do you people even know
why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because
of any other fucking reason!</p>
<p><strong>angelina</strong>: Roman make her stop! Make her stop baby
she’s freaking me out!</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: God damn it Sidney!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Hey bitch, don’t ever use prop cuffs to
restrain Gale Weathers.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I know all the tricks!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Dewey my God I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Don’t worry Sid I’d never leave you like
that.</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer’s always
superhuman.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: He wasn’t superhuman Dewey. He wasn’t
superhuman at all.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: This shit is really getting repetitive, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>dewey</strong>: Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but
what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Sure, why not. You did Save my
life,Mr. Rielly.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: Jesus Christ what happened? I
leave for two seconds to take my kid to the doctor, I come back and it’s
the fucking WILD BUNCH.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: It was just something that’s been itching to
be completed for the past four years.</p>
<p><strong>detective wallace</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Take care Detective. Give my regards to the
wife and kids.</p>
