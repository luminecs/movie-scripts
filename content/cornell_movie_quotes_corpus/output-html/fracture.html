<h1 id="fracture">fracture</h1>
<p><strong>credits sequence: extreme close-ups</strong>: An unfinished
mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys,
wiring, serve-motors. THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s,
well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt.
Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange. He
sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a
slot at the top of the device. His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -
- as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg- style maze,
setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles - - then missing a leap and
clattering across the work-table. Eyes on the device, Crawford’s hand
traps the ball. He stays still, analyzing. He selects a tiny screwdriver
from a neat array of metal- working and electronics tools. Makes a
miniscule adjustment to a single joint. Drops in another ball. It rolls
and flips and spirals all the way down. Crawford doesn’t react. Just
studies the machine. Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a
beautiful woman in her mid-30s. His wife.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: The N.T.S.B. guys are here.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s here.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: What about dinner tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We go out to dinner - we might never come
back.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Okay. I want to wake up with you. I want
to…</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: …at least see where you live.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I live…here.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Lieutenant Nunally, please.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: He doesn’t come on til six. You want his
voice mail?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No. Thank you. I’ll see him later.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re - home early.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I just felt a sudden urge.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are you…okay?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I could use a hug.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Have you been drinking?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’ve been watching you sleep. At
night.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: That’s creepy.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Sometimes when I’m at work, I’ll start
thinking about you and I’ll just get - just - overwhelmed.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Tommy -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s a dense, crushing - geophysical
force. Like I’m pinned. At the core - where things change. You ever get
that way about me, Jen?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m trying to describe my feelings.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Those don’t sound like feelings.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No? What’s the sound of one feeling…in a
forest?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You think you’re so much smarter than I
am. That must make you feel very powerful.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Helpless, actually.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay. Maybe it’s time to really talk.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Fine. Whatever. I’ll make you some
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I know. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Don’t be. Knowledge is pain. I’m used to
that.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s not like I don’t let little
pleasures, in return for the pain.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Tom? Jen? Everything okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE!</p>
<p><strong>swat commander</strong>: You the Negotiator?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Yeah. What do we know?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally. I’m a
hostage negotiator for the Los -</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Okay then. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Get rid of the vampires.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Do I call you Rob?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not vampires.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not vampires. Ghouls. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give me
the gun - so I can pay more attention to what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Is that your best shot? So to speak.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I just think - maybe it would -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Tell you what: I will if you will.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: We both put down our guns. At the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: We set them down and step away. Then you
can “pay more attention” to what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Happy ending, then.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned that
your wife -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s Tom.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You can call me Tom.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Tom. Your wife. Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I don’t think she is. I shot her, Rob.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: You shot your wife.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It was like I just suddenly - snapped. We
were arguing - and I got the gun.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: - okay - I hear you -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: And I shot her in the head. I know it was
wrong. Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: We need a medic in here! Get the ambulance
up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Oh no - God no - I can’t - get a -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You know, I think I read somewhere that a
good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. It’s on the inner
surface of the upper thigh. If you put your fingers - you know, right up
inside her dress -</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Wait a second - she’s not dead!</p>
<p><strong>swat commander</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Yeah. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing
the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on
a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. Law school
texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves. The radio chatters. Willy
knots a tie in his crisp white collar.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: Willy methodically packs legal folders
from last night’s “homework” into his big, battered briefcase. He has to
work to stuff all the files in. He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the
shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence
letter waiting on the desk. Reads it over. As he signs, we glimpse:</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Mrs. Demello? MRS. DEMELLO! Your CAR!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Come on, Phil: I called you as a courtesy,
and you start looking to take advantage?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m not knocking it down to a Class C. My
backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried
to kill his brother-in-law with - oh, right, a “golfing accident”? Your
client owns one golf club and no golf</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Well, I won’t see you in court, but someone
from this office will. You take it up with them, I gotta go. Willy
Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Wooton Sims?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No, I didn’t. Wow. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No - short notice is…fine. No, I can. Black
tie. Sure. What time? Okay. Yes. Thank her.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Wooton - SIMS?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Please stop saying, “Wooton Sims” over and
over. It’s starting to sound like nonsense words.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You asshole!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Okay: go back to “Wooton Sims.”</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: How the hell did you get a job at Wooton
Sims?! I can’t even get an interview!</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ve been here five years. I’m your
supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We’re just going to pretend he’s not talking,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>mona norman</strong>: No problem. I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m really jammed-up all day, and I need to
rent a tuxedo - for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: A tuxedo?! Oh, come on! You are so full of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: There must be a place that does that, right -
same day? I’m also gonna need a messenger to bring it here. This is my
suit size and my shirt size…I really appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats to this
charity opera thing every year, because Bob Wooton is the chairman of
this committee -</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: “Bob” Wooton?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s what the man told me to call him.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: You’re gonna need to pick out a style,
Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: A style.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: For the tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t know - I just don’t want to look like
I’m going to the prom.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: You wanna go Classic. Fix him up.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: We’ll get you something Classic. Willy
Slocum’s office.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Make sure it comes with cuff-links and
knee-pads.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh, that’s very nice: it’s good to be back in
high school.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Willy?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: God wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Our God?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Who art on the Eleventh Floor.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: There is no justice! There is no justice in
the city of Los Angeles!</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Sit. Eighty-four-percent conviction rate.
That’s remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: With a case load thirty percent higher than
any other first-year DDA. Of course - you also swapped more cases than
the rest of them put together.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I offered my losing cases in exchange for two
or three of anyone else’s possible convictions. They couldn’t handle
their workloads, and I prefer not to lose.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re going to need a middle initial.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re going to Wooton Sims.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: In two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’ll be able to afford a better suit. But
those guys all play squash and have middle names. They go in for the
mother’s maiden name a lot.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: My mother didn’t have a maiden name.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: So you’re a bastard; sometimes I can be a
son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong here.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I didn’t work this hard to stay where I
belong.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re a street-fighter, Willy. You should
be in court. We can move you up to better cases.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I appreciate the offer.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: I didn’t think so. Well - you got your
litigation experience. Your chops. And your juicy private sector job.
Anything else the City of Los Angeles can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No, I think that’s everything - thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: The offer stands. If you get tired of
carrying a spear.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: It’s an opera joke. Give my regards to
Bob.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Willy Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: I’ve got an Attempted Homicide. Conley
caught it last night, but he’s hung up in motions with Gardner.
Arraignment in Part Seven, at three o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Three o’clock is in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Thank you. What’s the temperature?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You do still actually work here, Willy,
right? I mean, you’re still going to be cashing your paycheck for
another two weeks and everything?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Just get somebody else for this one.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Everybody’s booked up. Look: it’s not going
to trial. There’s a weapon with prints, and a confession. Take the
arraignment and wait for the plea.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: A real confession?</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: Spontaneous and signed. Come on, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Okay. Here’s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>norman</strong>: You know - I really wish I was going to see
this.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who
dresses for court.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sorry, your honor. Long story.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Grapevine has it the punch-line is
Wooton Sims.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Good for you, double-oh-seven. Let’s
see what public service is offering you by way of a send-off:</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: The State of California Versus Thomas
Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mr. Crawford, you’ve been charged with
section 664 slash 187 of the California Penal Code: Attempted Murder,
with additional allegations of Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal Code
section 245 dash A2, with Great Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07. Do
you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of
rights?</p>
<p><strong>p.d. crawford</strong>: I do. But, your honor -</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: And do you wish to enter a plea at
this time?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not guilty. But I also want to waive my
right to counsel, and represent myself.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Do you have a problem with your
appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No. I just want to do it myself. I believe
it’s within my rights.</p>
<p><strong>p.d.</strong>: Your honor, if I could have a moment with my
client -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m not your client. Try and keep up,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Do the People have an objection or a
comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m sorry, your honor: we’ve got the weapon
and a signed confession. I really think Mr. Crawford needs a competent
attorney to - frankly - negotiate a plea.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I - can’t - this was supposed to be - with a
pro se defendant, this is going to drag out for months - and I’m not
even going to be here. The People request a continuance to -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Excuse me? Your honor? I’m willing to
waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial.
Does that help?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You don’t need to look out for Mr. Slocum,
Mr. Crawford. The District Attorney’s office can shift another
prosecutor to the case -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No, I like Mr. Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Mr. Slocum? He likes you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Mr. Crawford seems to understand his
rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: All due respect, your honor, I’m worried this
may turn into some sort of a - circus -</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: I appreciate your concern for the
dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum - considering you’re making the
argument dressed as a game-show host. Unfortunately, the man is a
tax-paying citizen, entitled by our Constitution to try and manipulate
the legal system, like everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I understand. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>judge feldman</strong>: Are the People ready to go to trial
without a preliminary hearing?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sure. Why not.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: You’re supposed to be good.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Is that what I’m supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I asked around. You’re supposed to be
top-notch - but to me it looks like you’ve got one foot out the door,
and you’re wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m sorry to…disappoint you.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I took Crawford’s confession.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And now you want mine?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I’m here to warn you. Take this seriously,
because it’s serious. This guy is stone cold - and his wife - is lying
in a hospital bed - with brain damage…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Are you gonna be on this, or what?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. I’m on it. You got a confession. You
took the gun out of his hand. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I’m just - telling you. Is that okay? Or
are you too friggin’ busy?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Forget it. It’s a lock. We’re good. Put him
down. Bury him.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Are you a shark?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You’ve been circling the lobby for
half-an-hour now, like if you stopped you’d die.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: If I stopped, I’d be standing around with no
one to talk to. At which point, death would be a relief.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Why don’t you talk to Bob?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: “Bob” is talking to the Governor. Do I know
you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate, Wooton
Sims.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that called,
with the invitation.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: On Bob’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Listen, I don’t…actually know “Bob.” I mean,
I’ve only met the man once.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You like opera?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Truth is, I haven’t really had that much
expos-</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Bob assigned you to my team. I’ll supervise
your case-work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep
an eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Kind of like a mentor.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Kind of like a probation officer.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty and a
hundred-and-ten-percent performance. But: you get to work on legendary
litigation. National, sometimes global, in scope. It’s high- stakes. And
cut-throat - even within the team. We burn out associates at an
astonishing rate.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You’re trying to scare me.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You’re going to have to try harder.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Can I ask you something personal?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: We have a guy in our criminal division, fresh
out of Yale, named Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich clients gets
pulled over, D.U.I. - which is routine bullshit, so Calvin gets it.
Against you. Next thing we know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton, who
has never even interviewed a junior associate before - let alone hired
one - says you’re on my team.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It was a good bust, so Calvin came to me for
a deal. I told him if he could arrange an interview for me with
Mr. Wooton, I would throw the case. I laid out his arguments and
evidence for him - and I showed him how I would lose. Calvin set up my
appointment for the day after our court date. Then he did what I had
suggested in court - and I wiped the floor with him. Your client got the
maximum. Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton. Bob.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Wow. You know what’s brilliant about
that?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You didn’t actually do anything all that
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Well - I wasn’t entirely honest with
Calvin.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You gonna get that?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Everyone I need to talk to is here.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: We need to talk about your transition
timetable.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He wants you
up-to-speed two weeks from Tuesday, because we’re getting on a plane to
Chicago for depositions in a class-action against our biggest client,
Armstead Pharmaceutical.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That’s catch-up on three years’ work - and
you haven’t closed out your old job yet.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m good at trials. Even by fire.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You know, a little bit of fear can be a very
healthy thing to have.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m looking forward to when I can afford the
luxury of having some.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’ll have them put the Armstead materials in
your new office.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thanks. Boss.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Marchand.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s Willy Slocum. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Your gun in that Palisades shooting is no
good.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: How can the gun be “no good”?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: It’s a perfectly good weapon. A Heckler
&amp; Koch nine-millimeter. It’s just no good as evidence. It’s never
been fired.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s the gun from the scene?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford and
registered to his wife, about a month ago. Apparently a gift.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And between the shooting and arrest, this guy
was locked inside his house.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Is that a question?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No, I mean, just: what’s the point? Playing
games with the gun. He’s alone in the house with the victim, and he
confessed - it’s not like the gun’s gonna get him off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Do you have a question I can answer?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Look, our weapon is in that house somewhere.
Get a team out to search it tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Ya think?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Slocum?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Where do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The idea here is we’re trying to take boxes
out - not bring more in.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: Is that the idea?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw- up. I
already have these documents. I sent this box: to the Defendant, at
County.</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: I picked up at County. Slip says bring
’em here.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Marchand.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Where are we on this gun?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: We can’t find it, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m in trial on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: I know. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m
there now.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You said you’d get a team out a week ago
-</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: I’m here now. My team has been here twice
already. Do you really need it?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Do I need it?! The weapon?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t know. Probably not. Defendant’s a
whack-job.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: He went pro se, right?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Just when you think they’re not really
stupid, they defend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: You’ve got a confession and an airtight
bunch of circumstantial. We’ve gone over this place top-to- bottom three
times now, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah, okay. Don’t worry about it. Sorry - got
a lot going on.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Must be rough, figuring out what you’re
gonna do with all that money.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hey, I had to sit through an opera last
week.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Oh gee - lemme see if I can express how
much sympathy I have:</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: How’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I heard somewhere, I think it was on
N.P.R., that you’re supposed to talk to people in a coma. Play their
favorite music. Supposedly it reaches them.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You represent Jennifer. The voice of the
victim, judicially speaking. But you haven’t gone to see her?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Too busy getting up to speed on Armstead
Pharmaceutical?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m not judging you. I think anyone -
coming from…what you came from - then paying your way through East-Okie
Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by writing papers for Princeton kids on
the internet - my God, it must have eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand
dollars in debt, eighty-four percent conviction rate: you deserve
this.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What the hell have you been doing.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m permitted the use of a private
investigator.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Not to investigate me!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why not? You’re investigating me.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You shot your wife.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Allegedly. That’s how it works, right? If
I can’t introduce something in court as evidence - it doesn’t exist.
Legally.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Look - I don’t want to play games with
you.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m afraid you have to.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Is this some form of - communication?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You sent me a box of papers.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s called Discovery. The State has a legal
obliga-</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: There’s nothing in it, Willy. You haven’t
‘discovered’ anything. Have you found the gun?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No. Does it bother you that I call you
Willy?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’d like you to consider becoming my
lawyer. I’ll pay you. A lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m - prosecuting you.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yeah, but I’m offering you a chance to get
on the right side of this whole mess while you still can.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I think - on advice of counsel - I’ll
decline to answer that one.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t need the gun to convict you, by the
way.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: She was cheating, you know.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It doesn’t matter what she did…Tom. What you
did is a crime.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called peers
will look at me and see themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated. Humiliated.
And you and I both know, Willy, that people have an infinite capacity
for believing in their own innocence.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Great. Take the stand. Tell your story. I’d
appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not to mention the fact you have no actual
evidence connecting me to the crime.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Except your confession.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: My grandfather was an egg farmer.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Is this gonna be about how you had a rough
childhood?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I used to candle eggs at his farm. You
know what that is? You hold an egg up to a light, and look for
imperfections. The first time I did it, he told me to put the ones that
were cracked or flawed in a bucket - for the bakery. He came back an
hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket. He
asked me what the hell I was doing. I found a flaw in every single one.
Thin places in the shell, minuscule cracks. Look closely enough and
you’ll find everything has a weak spot…where it can break.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Looking for mine?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No, I’ve found yours.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Illuminate me.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You’re a winner, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Huh. Well. Joke’s on me then, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ll see you in court, Mr. Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>pharmaceutical.</strong>: Willy is filling out forms - tax,
citizenship, benefits. He doesn’t notice Nikki when she comes to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Make sure you sign the one with the devil in
blood. It’s not binding otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Just want to be ready for Chicago. I’m all
closed-out, downtown. Last trial starts Monday.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You’ve got a trial Monday?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah: attempted murder.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That gives you three days. You told me - and
I told Bob - that you would be ready to hit the ground r-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The man confessed. And he’s pro se.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Willy, some but acting as his own lawyer - he
could drag it out for months!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You want to hear his witness list?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: No witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s kind of clever: this guy is trying to
provoke the system into declaring him insane. I think he thinks we’ll
call in the doctors and he can fake ’em out by refusing the defense.
He’s acting out this really - organized plan to appear crazy.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You’re gonna miss being in court, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m almost halfway through these. And I think
I’ve already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and
Florida. I have to check case law in each state, but it looks good. I’ll
get the rest done over the long weekend.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You don’t go home for Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: If you want - you’re welcome at mine. My
family’s.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I think it would be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: We established a perimeter around the
house and then waited for SWAT and the Negotiator. It was strictly by
the book.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So the house was completely surrounded within
how long of the first shots?</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: Maybe ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And when you arrived at the sc-</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: When you arrived on the scene, was there a
crowd?</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look
soon as it started.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And from what you could ascertain, no one
went into or came out of the house until SWAT and the negotiator
arrived?</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you. No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Your witness, Mr. Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No questions for this witness.</p>
<p><strong>close-up: the defense table - later that afternoon</strong>:
It’s a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford’s pad, each
covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on yet another, head
down, intent. Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big
diagram of a head:</p>
<p><strong>dr. kang</strong>: - through the frontal cortex and the
temporal lobe, coming to rest against the back of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So this bullet inflicted serious injury?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kang</strong>: It inflicted serious and irreparable
injury.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that someone
inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Crawford, you might want to
object. The witness can’t know your state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No thank you, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>kang</strong>: I would say so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you, Dr. Kang.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So after you put down your gun, what did
Mr. Crawford do?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: He confessed to shooting his wife.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He confessed. Did Mr. Crawford appear
confused or in any way intoxicated, impaired?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No. Not at all. He knew what was going
on.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What did Mr. Crawford say?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: He said, “I got the gun and I shot my wife.
God help me, I shot her in the head. I know it was wrong.”</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: I’m sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you
say something?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes. I want to object.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: On what grounds?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Your honor -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I don’t know what you’d call it. They - it
wasn’t the first time, either, but - I don’t know the legal term.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Why don’t you just explain it in
layman’s terms.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Fucking the victim.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Crawford -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You said layman’s terms -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Your honor -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m sorry - what would you call it -
legally - when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual
intercourse with your wife?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh - shit.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I think it’s objectionable - maybe I’m
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Your honor…</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Detective Nunally?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Rob?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Your honor, the People request a -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He had my witness list. He should have filed
to suppress.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: My mistake. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Crawford, I warned you about
representing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What about the fact that it’s true? I
mean, isn’t that the point here: to get to the truth?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Slocum - is it true?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t know. I only heard about it five
minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Put him back on the witness stand if you
don’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We can’t put him back on now! Not after what
the jury just saw. Your honor, I told you this would turn into a circus.
First he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: My Dick has evidence.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: My investigator. I call him Dick. I guess
I should call him as a rebuttal</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Okay - um: I’ll stipulate that my witness was
less than forthcoming …and that can more or less cancel out the fact
that the defendant withheld a crucial -</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Slocum - your witness was
intimate with the victim, and he assaulted the defendant during the
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Actually, while obtaining my so-called
“confession.”</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No way. Your honor -</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: He’s got a point. They were alone in
the house. The confession is no good.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh - come on!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Is this a legal argument? “Oh come
on”?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You want to get into it?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sorry. He dictated and signed his confession,
after that incident.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: In police custody. Arguably, in fear
for his life. I’m sorry, Mr. Slocum - it’s all ‘fruit of the tainted
tree.’ We have to exclude all versions of the confession and any
evidence collected by Lieutenant Nunally or by other police officers on
the night he was present.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This is insane!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s Biblical, isn’t it? The fruit and the
tree and -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He set this up! Don’t you see what he’s
doing?!</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Yes, I do. And I don’t like it. But
it’s done, so we have to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Do you think I could go home today, your
honor? With Thanksgiving around the corner -</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Don’t push it, Mr. Crawford. What
we’re going to do is give Mr. Slocum a few days to regroup and come up
with new evidence. If he doesn’t - then you can go home. That’s going to
put us into the long weekend. We reconvene Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Willy Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well - you’ve gotta admire the cleverness of
it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Come on, Willy - give the devil his due.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. I’m just trying to figure out what that
is.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob on how
he wants you to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Well, he pretty much has to if he’s gonna
save any face. So here’s the strategy: you let him.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I let him?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yeah, damage control. Stop getting your face
on TV. As it is, I had to talk Bob down from cancelling your
contract.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: But we’ve got to move fast and get out from
under. Otherwise, and I quote: “Stick a fork in this kid’s ass and turn
him over, he’s done.”</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I can’t just - walk away.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Willy: today, you got killed. The issue now
is saving your new life.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I guess…that would be the smart way of
looking at it.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You want to come out and get drunk?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No. Thank you. I’ve got some stuff to take
care of.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: All right. Don’t beat yourself up.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You don’t look into who the victim was
sleeping with?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He - threw me off. Look, Crawford knew he’d
be the prime suspect, so he gave us everything - but he made it all
radioactive. The night this went down, it was over.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: But you still walked it into court, Willy.
We might not have a case…but it didn’t have to be a public humiliation
for this office and the police department.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Are you taking me off?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re leaving anyway.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m starting to get a sense of this guy.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: That’s not new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I can take him now: he thinks he’s smarter
than I am.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: It’s not about you, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah, it is. He made it that way. He likes
me.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: What is that - some kind of Oklahoma
insult?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Let me do this. I won’t make you look
bad.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: No. You won’t. That’s what I need to make
sure you understand. I remove you now: I’m covered, I took some action.
If you go on with this, when you lose - blame has to come down. And
it’ll come down on you. I’ll have to investigate you for improprieties,
incompetence - anything I can. In public. I’ll hang you out to dry. For
the good of this office.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: If I lose.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You said “when.”</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: All right. It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You’re not easy to find. I had to call
Internal Affairs.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Yeah - they put me on a desk - ’til this
gets…sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: Got home - my wife already took the kids to
her folks. Press is all over our front lawn. Friggin’ vampires.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What the hell were you thinking. You’re on
the job and you get called to your girlfriend’s house -</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I didn’t know it was her house. I’d never
been there.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It was her name!</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I didn’t know her name!</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No last names. Her rules. We met at the
same hotel room, twice a week - no phone calls, no questions. She didn’t
want us to know too much about each other. She said it was like…travel
in a foreign country. No baggage - from our lives. Just us.
Escaping.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Did you get the feeling she had rules because
she had done it before? With other guys?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No. I don’t know. Maybe. No. It was all
just this…crazy thing. For both of us. It was… real. You know? We didn’t
expect that, when we started. We didn’t know where it was going. I had
cheated so many times, I was numb - but she was …new. And she made me
feel like there was - some chance. To change. We were scared. It was
like we were afraid to go forward, but we couldn’t go back. You always
think you have time. To work it out. Or make things right. What was I
supposed to do?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You were supposed to tell me!</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I’m married! I have kids!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You thought nobody knew - so maybe you could
just walk away clean.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No! I didn’t think HE knew! OKAY?! Even -
after. I thought it was just - massively fouled-up…bad luck. Like - God
- telling me - something. I’m there. My mind is going crazy. I know the
confession won’t hold if anyone finds out. I thought the guy was a
whack!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah? Well, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Is there anything else you can give me.
Anything that might get us some evidence.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: I…tried to warn you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You warned me he was smart. You didn’t warn
me you were stupid.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: How do we get the confession back in?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff’s deputies -</strong>: - passing hand-held metal
detectors along the furniture - - taking pictures down from the walls -
- turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the
closets - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures
recessed into the ceilings - - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on
the roof - - ripping out Crawford’s high-end home-theater system - -
taking apart the Porsche in the garage. Willy paces the edges of the
action, restless, edgy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Shake the boxes.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The cereal boxes - shake ’em. And there’s a
chicken in the freezer. Thaw it out, check inside.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The garage? Washer-dryer?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: And the tool shed, and the roof, and the
H.V.A.C. ducts.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What about the door frames? The floors?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: What did he do: rip open a door frame,
hide the gun inside and re-plaster the wall before SWAT showed up?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What about the neighbors’ property? He could
have thrown it over the hedges.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: We checked. He might have passed it off to
somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice, waiting, out the back.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This isn’t an accomplice sort of guy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This is a…guy who likes to show off.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s a physical object. It can’t just vanish.
We’re missing something - some step in the story.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The neighbor sees her get home. He’s already
inside. She lets herself in. A minute or two later: blood-pattern says
she’s standing over there - he’s somewhere around here.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Boom.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: But then he carries her back there.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Because he’s gonna need time. To confess.
When she’s alone with the cop.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Neighbor comes to the door.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Crawford shouts, “Leave us alone” and fires
three more rounds: boom-boom- boom.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: So everybody knows he’s dangerous - and
she might still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So they’ll call the Negotiator. Now he’s got
about ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: I’m sorry, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Do you dare stay out? Do you dare go in?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And IF you go in - Should you turn left or
right? Or right and three-quarters? Or maybe not quite.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You can get so confused that you’ll Down long
wiggled roads at break-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And grind on for miles across weirdish Headed
I fear, toward a most useless</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The Waiting Place… For people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go Or a bus to come, or a plane to go</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Or the mail to come, or the rain to go Or the
phone to ring, or the snow to snow</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Or waiting around for a Yes or No Or waiting
for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Waiting for the fish to bite Or waiting for
wind to fly a kite Or waiting around for Friday night Or waiting perhaps
for their Uncle</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break Or a
string of pearls, or a pair of Or a wig with curls… Or Another
Chance.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I heard it might - help - if somebody talked
to her.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The man who shot her.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Is there any chance…she might come out of
this?</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Are you a member of the family?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Sorry. I’m with the District Attorney’s
office. We don’t have any other witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: This woman had a bullet plow through her
brain.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I know. But you hear about people waking up
from comas. After everybody said pull the plug - they wake up. You hear
stuff like that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too. All
the time.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s not impossible, though. Is it? I mean -
why else are you keeping her like this?</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: No. It’s not impossible. But even if she
did, she might not remember how to talk - let alone anything about how
she was shot.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: When I was here alone before, she moved a
little.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Are you just going to keep asking the same
question in different ways until you hear the answer you want?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s how it works with the law.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: I knew I should have gone to law
school.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So this is all exactly how he left it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And he was - distraught.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: He was drinking. The past few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: But he was working on this.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: All distraught and everything.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Do you want coffee. He said I should ask.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Tell him I said no thank you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: How long do you keep the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: A month.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Can I get a copy of October 9th?</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: I’ll have it for you Friday.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m kind of under the gun here.</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: We’re short-staffed tonight and
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>assistant manager</strong>: Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Right. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: White or dark, Willy?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Anything is fine, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: I’m off-duty, you can call me Lew.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So - is everyone in this family involved in
the law?</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Well, Nikki’s not.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Ha ha. Burton’s a counsel for Sierra Club,
and Sandra’s ACLU - so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give
me a hard time, because I can buy and sell them.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: We’re not actually for sale, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Nicole decided early-on that black sheep
was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her
siblings.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You know of any other family in America where
the corporate lawyer who’s going to make partner by thirty- five is the
“black sheep”?</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Well - you may be lost beyond recovery, but
maybe we can still convince Willy that defending giant corporations
against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t think so, sir. It’s where the money
is.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: I believe that phrase refers to banks. And
it was coined by a thief.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Times have changed.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You don’t have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t mind; I get this kind of thing now
and then. Almost always from people with money.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Appearances can be deceiving, Willy. I grew
up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I promise
you I saw my share of hard times.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: My mom OD’d fairly frequently, so they put me
in a Group Home. My younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing
twenty-five-to-life.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: You win.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I usually do.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: Yes. I see that.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: I don’t know if you will against the
wife-shooter, though.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Nice, Burton.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s not over ’til it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: That looked pretty over.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Anyway, Willy’s been taken off the case.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: It might not seem like it now, but that’s a
blessing in disguise, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Taken off.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: That…doesn’t make any sense. Lobruto has to
do some kind of damage control -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I asked him not to.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You are really stupid, did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m - getting new evidence -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh, that’s right
- they open early the day after Thanksgiving. You’re gonna be fine!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Did it ever occur to you I might be good
enough to still win?!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Who cares?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The man shot his -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You wanted corporate, right?! You wanted to
play in the big leagues?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah, I’m just -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You go to all that trouble getting yourself
in - and then you just pay no attention to wh-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Look - I’m sorry - can we not talk about this
here?!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I need to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Look, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Did you hear me, when I said Bob wanted you
gone as soon as this thing broke?! Did you hear me say I went out on a
limb to convince him -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better than damage control if
I actually turn it around?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: And what if you don’t?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You don’t get it at all, do you?! You pulled
a stunt to get yourself this job. Fine: you’re a hot-shot! Wooton Sims
does not need hot-shots. Because you don’t win. The firm wins. Bob
wins.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What am I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: We told the man you’re getting on a plane to
Chicago, Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I think maybe I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: All right. Call if you want.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ve got some work to do. I need to call a
cab.</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: You know what nobody understands about
certain kinds of underpaid public service work? Now and then you get to
put a fucking stake in a bad guy’s heart. We’re not supposed to talk
about that when we visit a third-grade class on Career Day, and it
doesn’t get you very far into the country-club locker room - but it’s
hard to beat when you actually get to do it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: We have to find the gun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you, Professor Einstein. It would also
be good to find a couple of</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No - Willy: we need to find the gun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ve had three different teams here -</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: He didn’t leave between the shooting and
when we took him out in cuffs. The gun is here. So we have to find
it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Well - we can’t! You want to move on?</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: There’s a guy in the Evidence Room, owes me
a favor. Well - it’s not so much a favor as I know stuff about him. He
can trade this for the bullet from Jennifer, give us a ballistic
match.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s a crime.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: So who’s gonna get away with a crime - this
asshole, or us?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: What else have you got?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ll find a way.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Willy. There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Guns don’t just walk out of crime scenes.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Two months before he shot his wife, this
guy had his investigator watching the cop at work. He knew exactly how
it would go down - and he didn’t leave any loose ends.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Then what is this:</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hotel surveillance. From that day. He was
there. Why?</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Had to see it for himself.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: See what? They were out at the pool.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: The unmade bed. Her panties. Man’s gonna
shoot his wife in the head, he needs to get himself all worked up.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Worked up.</p>
<p><strong>marchand</strong>: Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back into
court and take your lumps - then you start your cushy new life, and you
forget all about this one. And then you can lend me money and shit.</p>
<p><strong>nunally</strong>: It’s done. In the tool shed: taped to the
blade, inside the lawn-mower.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Maybe. Can I ask you to do something
for me this morning?</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Write down your cell number. Once my trial is
in session, wait outside. I might call - and just hang up. If I do, I
want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about
the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: You found it?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>mona</strong>: Oh: this came for you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: So - between the time you heard the first
gunshot and called 911, and the time of Mr. Crawford’s arrest - you had
the Crawford house in view?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Yes. I was very concerned about Jennifer.
She was a lovely woman.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No one but Thomas Crawford came in or
out?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Gifford. No further
questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Did you see the guy run out the back
door?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: What…“guy”?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: The other guy. The one who shot my wife.
Did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: I couldn’t see the back of the house. I
believe…the police went around back when they arrived.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Re-direct, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’ve also written a motion to dismiss.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Objection - I’m on re-direct!</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: The prosecutor doesn’t have any actual
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m in the middle of presenting -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: All of his witnesses are going to testify
to the same facts: that my wife was shot and that I was, tragically, in
the house at the time …a witness - and, in a way, a victim myself. I’ll
stipulate to Mr. Slocum’s entire witness list right now, a request a
directed verdict or dismissal, per California versus Collier, 1982, and
the Appellate court decision, v. Watrus, 486.19.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your legal skills seem to have improved over
the long weekend, Mr. Crawford.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Slocum?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Have you got any new evidence?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: May I have a moment, your honor?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Slocum?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Your honor? Can we signal the prosecutor
from here on planet Earth?</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Mr. Slocum? Now or never.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I have no further evidence at this time, your
honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Motion to dismiss is granted.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: Order! The jury is released, with
our apologies -</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: - and the Defendant is free to
go.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Even a broken clock gets to be right twice
a day.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Hey, you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What did you think - I wasn’t keeping
tabs?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t know what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Listen: what do you say I take you out
tonight and get you completely trashed? Tomorrow’s just a travel da-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hang on -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Your husband said something…that I can’t seem
to shake loose of. He said I’m a winner. And he’s right. I can’t lose. I
can’t stand people who lose. I may have been working so hard to put some
distance between me and…people like you - that maybe I messed up. I
don’t know if did anything wrong. Or what I should have done. I really
don’t know, any more…what I’m supposed to do. But I feel like I let you
down. Somehow in the…process. And if I did, I’m sorry. That’s all. I
just - I hope you…have…just, some… Anyway.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She was looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Yeah, I understand -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No, she was looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>close up - jennifer’s eyeball</strong>: A beam of light
slides across it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s reacting.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: The normal reflex goes downward. Up
indicates brain trauma.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s in there. She was looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut.
They all move - they make sounds, they twitch. You think they’re
dreaming. But they’re not. It’s just what’s left of the system, sending
broken signals.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I. or
something? And I want a coma specialist to see her.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: You’re not authorized to order tes-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ll get you authorization. First thing
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: You get the paperwork, I’ll do what I
can.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Mr. Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Just…visiting.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: This isn’t like you at all.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You haven’t got anything to gain.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh - right. That’s my weak spot. Ever think
about what yours might be? Your flaw?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Of course I have. The truth about me is,
Willy…I’m really not very nice.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You sure do know a lot, though. Got everybody
all figured out, everything set up, like one of your contraptions. Then
you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to. Must
be kind of…boring. At that point.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy? Imagine
it - imagine she was yours. And you knew you were losing her. Imagine
days. Weeks. Going through her desk. Her purse. Her closet. Alone.
Staring at her clothes. Her shoes. Knowing this is what it will be like.
After. Do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living - with her -
every day, knowing?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: But you had to, right? You needed time to set
it all up…your “crime of passion.”</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: There are many kinds of passion,
Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. There are. So - thank you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: For sharing your wisdom. All your little
helpful bits of information. You were right.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: About…?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Talking to her.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hi, I’m just -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Excuse me - I’m new, I just started - and
there’s something wrong with my card. Can you buzz me in?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Who are you here to see?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I work here. Willy Slocum. I’m new -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for Nikki
Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Wait a second - never mind, here she is,
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Hey…Bob - Can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You let him know what happened last
night?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I told him.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Great - who do I work with on it while you’re
gone?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You don’t work with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney and a
health-care proxy, he can disconnect her life-support whenever he wants.
If we don’t move fast -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Jesus, Willy, wake up! It’s over! What is
wrong with you - it’s first year law: that woman could fully recover and
swear he shot her and it</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I told you - we bring a civil suit -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: You’ve got no standing.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It doesn’t have to stick: we just need to get
a court order for now - to keep Crawford from pulling the plug! With all
the brain-power here, I’m sure somebody can come up with a pretext or
call in a favor. Then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a
state- appointed conservatorship - so we can protect her while we fight
him on -</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: What’s the point, Willy?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The point?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This man is going to kill his wife.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Yeah. What does that have to do with Wooton
Sims?</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I warned you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No, this is insane.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: It’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I warned you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You’re not really just gonna let this happen,
are you?!</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: Oh I’m supposed to lose my job over your
problems?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: My problems?! Wait a second - this is not
about my anything any more -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This is about taking a couple of goddamn
weeks off to try and save a woman’s life!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Don’t bother. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: What do the doctors say?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: People wake up out of these things.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: What did the doctors say,
Mr. Slocum?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: They said…there’s no way to really know. I’m
trying to get them to run more tests - but I was there, and I’m telling
you.</p>
<p><strong>judge robinson</strong>: I’m sorry. I have no probable cause
to issue a court order against Mr. Crawford - and he’s protected
agai-</p>
<p><strong>protecting her?!</strong>: The Judge stops - giving Willy a
hard eye: I’m sympathetic, but yelling at me is not a smart approach.
Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then
nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the
homeward-bound crowds. The Judge watches him go. Grimaces.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m sorry - but nobody else seems to give a
damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Have you been home at all today, Willy?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No - I’ve been trying to get some-</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: There’s a court order out against you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: A restraining order. You were at the
hospital? Talking to her doctors?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Crawford hired a lawyer this time. They saw
Judge Gorman this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Against me.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You need to stay away from him, and his
wife, and the hospital. He can have you arrested if you don’t. I’m
sorry. I can’t help you. I told you how it would go.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Can you do anything for her?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: I don’t see how.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lunt</strong>: Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Can I use your fax machine?</p>
<p><strong>gardner</strong>: These have to be served in person.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Move it if you need to!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You just missed her.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: She just went on up.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: How long ago…did she die?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What? The roof.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He’s - moving her by helicopter?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Nothing but the best.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lunt</strong>: This orders him not to take her off life
support! He’s not! We can’t stop the man from -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Then just hold it - for a couple of hours!
Have it inspected!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lunt</strong>: You’re talking about a phenomenally
expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the man has every right to move his
wife!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: She’s not gonna get there!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This man is a mechanical engineer with
expertise in air crashes! He has access to airfields and he knows
exactly how to make it look like an accident! You know what he did! You
know why she’s like this!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Why are we going out over the ocean?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Less traffic.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We have to turn back!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Get in your seat!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He’s doing something - we have to turn
back!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Who’s doing something?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: He is! You have to get us DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Get back in your goddamn seat!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Willy, I’m not doing anything. Everyone
can see that.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’m TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK! He’s
DOING SOMETH-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: I don’t know - I’m - there’s a -
malfunction -</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: I can’t do anything with this, up
here.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: She’s D.N.R.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: She’s Do Not Resuscitate.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s in her living will.</p>
<p><strong>med tech</strong>: She’s D.N.R. She signed it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: There’s a restraining order - she’s protected
- I’m authorizing you to do it!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No extraordinary measures. Unless your
court order specifies</p>
<p><strong>what the hell is going on back there?!</strong>: - the Med
Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer’s stretcher - Willy
struggles furiously -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Wait! WAIT - LOOK!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You messed up. With all your plans and
games.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Shhhh. It’s okay. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You’re gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Jennifer? Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Jennifer?! JENNIFER?!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No. Come on, Jennifer. Fight back.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Don’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You pushed it, Willy. We didn’t have to be
here. But now you’re my witness. You saw: I didn’t touch anything, I
didn’t do anything. The machine went down. Anybody asks - you’ll have to
tell them. What you saw. That’s really kind of perfect, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re not answering your phone.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s kind of an answer in itself, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Where are you headed?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Haven’t decided yet. Just someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: I shouldn’t have let it get so far out of
control. We all lose, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: We just have to live with that, and keep
fighting the good fight.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s not what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You belong in a courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I need to - get to know myself better.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: You’re a good lawyer. All this may have
even made you a better lawyer. Don’t waste it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I didn’t just lose a case! I let a man get
away with murder.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: If it makes you feel any better -
technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: His wife is dead!</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: We can still get him. We can take him back to
court.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Willy…</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Double jeopardy doesn’t apply! We bring a new
charge - of homicide.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Willy - what happened to you, on the
helicopter - we don’t even know if we could prove -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No: he shot her and she died. The fact that
it took time - the fact that he went to trial in between, just for
shooting her - doesn’t matter. He fired a gun and caused her death, and
that’s murder. If he can twist the law around - then so can we.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: A second indictment on the same
incident?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: A man burns down a house; we charge him with
arson. There were people sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in the
hospital, they die. We’d charge him with murder. Right?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: All your evidence is still toxic. The
confession, the arrest - it’s all still inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: I’m sorry, Willy. It was a good idea, but
-</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I’ll get something new.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Willy, you can’t -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t work for you. Right?</p>
<p><strong>lobruto</strong>: Don’t do anything crazy.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: What else have we got left?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: These are from that thing at the
courthouse, right?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Very dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I want the gun.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why? You’ve already got one.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I want the gun you shot your wife with.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: One way or another, I’m going to see to it
you receive justice tonight.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You’re serious, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Willy. You got religion, didn’t you?! You
care. That’s…priceless.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No, it’s very sweet. Really.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Getting it like this: is that going to
hold up in court?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I don’t work for the D.A. any more. I’m just
a guy who broke into your house. When the police arrest me - they’ll
inventory anything in my possession. If that happens to be crucial
evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It takes a very special kind of person to
look right into someone’s eyes and pull the trigger. It takes a unique
kind of strength.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I guess you’d know that.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes. I would.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Then I’m in for a - rude awakening.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Tick-tock.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Where did you even get yourself a gun?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: It’s Nunally’s.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Nunally’s. Really.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yeah. Really.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: There I was, with a perfectly good weapon
just sitting in the evidence warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Willy. Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I thought you might appreciate the
…irony.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Willy. Think.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: “A perfectly good…Heckler and Koch
nine-millimeter.”</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: The police will be here very soon.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: The exact same type of gun you bought your
wife, a month before.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: If they see you with a gun in your hand -
they’re not likely to ask a lot of questions.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s why you went to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s why you went into the room.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: You took his gun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And you left him yours.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I gave it back.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: After you’d used it.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Then you told Nunally you’d put it down - if
he put down his.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: That’s why you moved her back there -</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: The truth is I could have done it right in
front of the man and he wouldn’t have noticed.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He had…other things on his mind.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And all you had to do was switch the guns
back - in the commotion -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: - and then wait -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: - until Nunally walked the murder weapon
right out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You know, this is really kind of fun. It’s
like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: This caveman’s gonna put you in prison for
the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s still not evidence, Willy. There’s no
prints left by now. Nothing ties that gun to me.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: No. That would be true. Except for all those
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Those what?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: With all those little cracks and weak places.
Like Nunally. Shooting himself, right there in the courthouse. I didn’t
think he was going to do that. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I mean, we all knew he was going to fall
apart sooner or later. That was part of your plan, right? Like a bank
shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife - and destroy her lover. With
one bullet. Well: four bullets, actually. Right?</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: First bullet goes into your wife.</p>
<p><strong>intercut quick flashbacks:</strong>: Crawford fires at
Jennifer -</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Then three more out the front of the house,
to get some attention.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Then while you’re waiting for the show to
begin - you have to reload Nunally’s gun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I mean, you don’t want him wondering where
the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that
night.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And I’m betting you didn’t worry about
fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: Crawford’s fingers, putting the bullets in
the clip. Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the
ornate tracks.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: I mean, why would you? Nobody’s going to be
looking at his gun.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: And sooner or later, life goes on, those four
incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Except Nunally only fired one of those
bullets. Into himself.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Which means there are still three left with
your fingerprints on them - Tom. In this clip.</p>
<p><strong>willy</strong>: Everybody has a weak spot, right? Some place
they break.</p>
