<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know. That’s why I’m asking.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where’s Wong?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know. If you see him
on the street somewhere, tell him he’s fired.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How was Palm Springs?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hot. Where do I sign?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You got a nice tan, though.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I’d
try to get my money back, but who do you ask? Two hundred dollars a
night, for what?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. I’ll take the other one. Right. Well it’s
good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: If you’re lucky.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it! What the hell … ?</p>
<p><strong>wino</strong>: I didn’t take nothin’. I was just napping.
Don’t hit me. I was cold.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing? You
can’t do this. This is government property.</p>
<p><strong>wino</strong>: Don’t throw me out. They’re gonna get me.
They’ll tear me to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Come on. You can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>wino</strong>: Please! I never hurt anybody when I was alive.
Believe me. I don’t belong here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: New York!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know. One of these days, I’m gonna
see Louis. My back’s killing me.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Now? What about the boss? He’s not gonna
like it.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Well, I’ll miss riding home with you. I was
looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’ll be glad to avoid the crush.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I enjoy crushing into you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Gently. My back.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come on, Jake. That didn’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I know you. How come you’re so tense
today?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What can I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I saw Sarah the other day.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Her knee acting up?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A bit.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What did she have to say?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Turn on your right side. How about the other
“right?” I don’t understand you philosphers. You’ve got the whole world
figured out but you can’t remember the difference between right and
left.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I was absent the day they taught that in
school. What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not much. She’s like you that way. Two clams.
No wonder your marriage didn’t last. Put your hand under your head. Take
a breath and then let it out.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Ah, good. Now turn to your left.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She talk about the boys?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She says she can’t get them new coats because
you haven’t sent the alimony for three months.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She told you that? Did she tell you about the
$2,000 I’m still paying for the orthodontist? I’ll bet she didn’t
mention that.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She said you were a son of a bitch and she
regrets the day she set eyes on you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I thought you said she didn’t say much.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She didn’t. That’s about all she said. Put
your hand up. Good. I think she still loves you. Take a breath and let
it out.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Loves me!? She hasn’t said a kind word about
me in years!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Right. She doesn’t stop talking about you.
You’re always on her mind. That’s love, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She hates me, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You should go back to her.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted
some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn’t make
it. She can’t forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew
up in.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Her problem is that you spent eight years
getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I
didn’t want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ
to comprehend this chaos.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: If it was any other brain but yours, I might
agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I can’t relax.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Wiggle your toes.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I found one. He’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: God almighty. What did you do to me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I had to get in there. A deep adjustment.
Rest a moment and let it set a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I had this weird flash just then.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve been having them recently.
then changes the You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown
cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more
Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won’t take it. You tell your girl friend to
calm down if she knows what’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Louis, you’re a life saver.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: When there are gray skies, I don’t mind the
gray skies, as long as there’s you …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: “Hey, Mr. Postman …”</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Maybe it’s all the pressure, Jake. The
money. Things like that. Or your wife.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why do you bring her up?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: ’Cause she’s always on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: When was the last time I said a word?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It has nothin’ to do with talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Or maybe it’s the war.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s still there, Jake. Even if you never
say a word about it. You can’t spend two years in Vietnam …</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What does that have to do with anything? Does
it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those
Godforsaken creatures?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: New York is filled with creatures.
Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: They’re like demons, Jez.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Demons, Jake? Come on. They’re winos and bag
ladies. Low life. That’s all they are. The streets are crawling with
‘em. Don’t make em into somethin’ they’re not. It’s the pressure, honey.
That’s all it is.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They
were aiming right at me.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: They weren’t human!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Come on. What were they, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You still love me?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Says here the world’s comin’ to an end. The
battle of heaven and hell they call it. Should be quite a show;
fireworks, H-bombs, and everything. You believe them, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Me neither … God, look at this. Two heads.
Only lived two days. A day for each head. Could you imagine me with two
heads? We’d probably keep each other up all night - arguing and whatnot.
You wanna see the picture?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Goddamn you son-of-a-bitch! My uncle’s dogs
used to treat me better than you do. At least they’d lick my toes once
in a while. At least they showed some fucking interest.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: All right! All right! All right!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You love me?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Della’s party’s tonight. Why don’t we go?
It’ll take your minf offa things. And I won’t make you dance. I promise.
Huh? consent. JEZZIE hugs You still love me, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’d like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Carlson? Is he new here?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: New? He’s been here for years.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Not according to my charts. Do you
have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Look, I need to see him. I know where his
room is. Just give me a pass. I won’t be long. Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Our doctors are seen by appointment
only.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Damn it. I was in the veteran’s out- patient
program. He knows me.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jacob Singer.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I’m sorry but there’s no record of a
Jacob Singer in our files.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Whataya mean, no record?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You want me to spell it out? There’s
nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s ridiculous. I’ve been coming here for
years. Listen to me. I’m going out of my fucking mind here. I need to
see him.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: If this is an emergency we have a
staff of psychiatric social workers. There’s about an hour’s wait. I’ll
be glad to take your name. Why don’t you just fill out this form?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it! I don’t want a social worker.
Carlson knows me.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hey! You can’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn’t this his
office?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I’m so sorry. Obviously you haven’t …
Dr. Carlson died.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Died?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: A car accident.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jesus, Jesus! … When?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Last month, before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: No one knows. They say it blew up.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Do you want me to get someone?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. No. It’s okay. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hold it. Just hold it. Where the hell do
you think you are? This is Bellevue, for God’s sake. People running
around here get shot.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: It’s alright. He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Come on, get out of here. I wouldn’t want
to interfere with the U.S. Mail.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: Hey, you! Let me look at your hand!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Go on Jake. She reads ’em like a book.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: You have an unusual hand.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I could have told you that.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: You see this line here? It’s your life line.
Here’s where you were born. And this is where you got married. You’re a
married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: You know, you got a strange line here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s short, huh?</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: Short? It’s ended.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, terrific.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: It’s not funny. According to this … you’re
already dead.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Just my luck.</p>
<p><strong>dancers</strong>: Come on man, show your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on professor. You got feet, too.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hold me, baby!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s burning up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Total delirium.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s some gash. His guts keep spilling
out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Push ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>admirer</strong>: You are out of your mind, man. Out of your
fuckin’ mind.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Jake, you little devil. You never told me you
could dance like that.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Jezzie, what did you put in his drink?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I wanna leave. Get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Oh, come on. It’s early.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: him, his voice filled Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: We’re at Della’s.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What do you mean? Where do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where’s Della? Bring her here?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Why? What for?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Show me Della!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Hey, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Hiya Jake. That was some dance.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Della?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: You want to see me? Well, here I am.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Just to see you. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Well, how do I look?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Like Della.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Are you feeling all right? Shit, you’re
burning up. Feel his forehead.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Damn, that’s hot. Maybe from dancing.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I think you should lie down.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Can’t you stop it?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If I could stop it, I’d stop it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Is he sick?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: He’s on fire.</p>
<p><strong>elsa</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stay away from me! Don’t you come near me!
All of you. Go to hell! Go to hell, goddamn you! Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll call a cab.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I’ve never been so mortified in my whole
life. Never! Screaming like that. I don’t understand what’s gotten into
you, Jake, to make you do a thing like that. You’re not acting normal.
I’ve lived with too many crazies in my life. I don’t want it anymore. I
can’t handle it. I’m tired of men flipping out on me. Shit, you’d think
it was my fault. Well you picked me, remember that. I don’t need
this.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: All right! All right!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: If you go crazy on me you’re goin’ crazy by
yourself. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s it say? A hundred and two?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I don’t believe this. I’m calling the
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s gone to the top.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How high is that?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: The numbers stop at 107.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Get your clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What are you talking about? I’m freezing.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Get your clothes off!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’d the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: That you’d die on the way to the hospital.
Now get into that tub.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: He’s coming right over.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Coming here?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Goddamn it. Get in here. I can’t stand
around waiting.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You’re out of your mind. I’m not getting in
there. I’d rather die.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: That’s your decision.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Look at me. I’m ice cold.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’re red hot, damn it. Get in there. I’ve
got to get more ice.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What kind of man are you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Lie down!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Sam, Tony, come in here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hey, I’m not dressed.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You got nothin’ we ain’t seen before.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Get the hell off me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: He’s like a hot coal.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s for your own good, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Let go of me, you sons of bitches.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m freezing! I’m freezing! Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Sam, I can’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t you let go.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Jez, get help. My hands are killing me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Help me! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Here. I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Take his legs.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Run your hands under hot water.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carmichael</strong>: I have some ice from the
machine.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Bring it in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carmichael</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: He doesn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carmichael</strong>: I don’t blame him. What should I do
with the ice?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Pour it in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carmichael</strong>: On top of him?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: He’s melting it as fast as we dump it
in.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carmichael</strong>: Okay. My husband’s got two more
bags. He’s coming. They’re heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God! You’re killing me! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Damn! You and your fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not cold.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Of course not. You have all the blankets. It
must be ten degrees in here. I’m telling you, Sarah, if you want to
sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that
window is closed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s not healthy with it closed.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This is healthy? I’ll probably die of
pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What a dream I was having. I was living with
another woman … You know who it was?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jezebel, from the post office. You remember,
you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her.
God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire.
Only I was burning from ice.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you
cheat on me, even in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She was good in bed, though.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She had these real beefy thighs.
Delicious.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I thought you said it was a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Daddy, what was that noise?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Gabe? What are you doing … ?</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: There was a bang.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It was the window.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Tell your mother.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Mom, it’s …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I heard you. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Will you tuck me in?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh … all right.</p>

<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jed. It’s the middle of the night. over to
JED in the lower What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>jed</strong>: You forgot my allowance.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Your allowance? It’s five A.M. We’ll talk at
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>jed</strong>: Okay, but don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I love you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is this, a convention? I love you, too,
Pickles. Now go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Wait … Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t go? I’m not going anywhere. I’m right
here, Gabe. Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of
hours.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: … I love you.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Don’t shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: A bit more … a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I love you, Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They’re here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank God. Move ’em out!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Bust your balls!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Move it! Move it!</p>

You must have friends in high places, that’s all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake. his head and strokes his You’re gonna
be all right, Jake. You’re gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Am I home?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’re here. Home. The doctor said you’re
lucky your brains didn’t boil. What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You
kept sayin’ “Sarah, close the window,” over and over. And talkin’ to
your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of
ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Are we in Brooklyn?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’re right here, Jake. You just rest. The
doctor said you had a virus. That’s what they say when they don’t know
what it is. You can’t do anything for a week. He says you gotta
recuperate. Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken
soup. It’ll warm you up.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You know, you really ought to get out today.
You can’t just sit around like this all the time. It’s not healthy. It’s
not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin’. Go to a movie.
Christ, who’s gonna know? You think I care? I don’t give a shit. Go.
Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello! Anybody
home? Anybody in there?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Goddamn it! I can’t stand it anymore. I’ve
had it up to here. Go ahead and rot if you want … You son-of-a- bitch,
I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I made you a tuna fish sandwich. It’s in the
fridge. Eat a carrot with it. The aspirin’s on the bottom shelf. We’re
out of soap so, if for some reason you decide to wash yourself again,
use the dishwashing stuff. room and returns with I’m sorry I yelled, but
you get on my nerves. makes eye contact with</p>
<p>****: Hello? Listen, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Look, I’m horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a
little?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You are the most unbelievable woman I have
ever met. One second you’re a screaming banshee and the next you’re
Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That’s what I want to know. Will the
real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Oh shit. Tell ’em I’ve left.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Jacob Singer?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Speaking.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Paul Gruneger!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Paul Gruneger! Well I’ll be goddamned!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are
you? I haven’t seen you in what, five, six, years?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A long time.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jesus Christ. How’ve you been? What’s
happening in your life?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nothin’ much.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me,
to what do I owe the honor?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need to see you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shit, Paul. I’d love to see you. But I’m kind
of laid up here. I’ve been sick.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have
put on twenty pounds.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I work in a bakery.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You’re lucky. How many vets you know are even
employed?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Count ’em on one hand.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s almost like a conspiracy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No joke. Fuckin’ army! That goddamn war. I’m
still fightin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s not worth it. You’ll never win.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You tellin’ me? How many times can you die,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Still married, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You and everybody else. God I hate this area.
Makes me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why the hell we drivin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I just need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You can’t talk in Brownsville?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m not sure where I can talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let’s get a couple drinks, okay? Hey, take a
look behind us. Do you think that car is followin’ us?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That black car?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Pull the mirror down on the sun visor. Just
watch ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s goin’ on Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Somethin’s wrong, Jake. I don’t know what it
is but I can’t talk to anybody about it. I figured I could with you. You
always used to listen, you know?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m going to Hell!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s as straight as I can put it. And don’t
tell me that I’m crazy ‘cause I know I’m not. I’m goin’ to Hell. They’re
comin’ after me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’ve been followin’ me. They’re comin’
outta the walls. I don’t trust anyone. I’m not even sure I trust you.
But I gotta talk to someone. I’m gonna fly outta my fuckin’ mind.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry. Sometimes I think I’m just gonna jump
outta my skin. They’re just drivin’ me wild.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who, Paul? What exactly … ?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know who they are, or what they are.
But they’re gonna get me and I’m scared, Jake. I’m so scared I can’t do
anything. I can’t go to my sisters. I can’t even go home.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re waitin’ for me, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t stop it. I try. Oh God! Help me
Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s okay, Paul. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t do anything. bit and the shaking Paul,
I know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’ve seen them too … the demons!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve seen them?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Everywhere, like a plague.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: God almighty. I thought I was the only
one.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Me, too. I had no idea. It’s like I was
coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh God. I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is it Paul? What’s happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They keep telling me I’m already dead, that
they’re gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.
pocket and pulls out a small Bible and silver I carry these everywhere
but they don’t help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I’m crazy. My mother
filed a report with the army.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The army?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She said I haven’t been the same since then.
Since that night. There’s still this big hole in my brain. It’s so dark
in there, Jake. And these creatures. It’s like they’re crawling out of
my brain. What happened that night? Why won’t they tell us?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re monsters, Jake. We’re both seein’ ’em.
There’s gotta be a connection. Something.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep
thinkin’ one of ’em’s gonna come up behind me. Somethin’s wrong when a
guy can’t even take a leak by himself. I’ve seen ’em take people right
off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I
can’t even go home.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You come home with me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What about your girlfriend? You don’t think
she’ll mind?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Are you kidding? We’ve put up more of her
cousins. You wouldn’t believe how they breed down there.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn, this is my lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: We’re doing the best we can.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Get me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where am I? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Just lie still. You’re okay. You’re not
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did anyone see the police report? It sounds
like a detonation job to me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The paper said it was electrical; a freak
accident.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Bullshit. Someone’s covering somethin’. That
was no accident.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Cars don’t explode that way. Any simpleton
knows that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But the paper …</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: That was set. I’m tellin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: By who? Why? Paul didn’t have an enemy in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, you’re talkin’ about Paul. Who’d want to
hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What did he talk about when you guys went
out? Did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He was upset. He thought people were
following him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re kidding. Who?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He didn’t know … Demons.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What do you mean, demons?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He told me he was going to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: What’d he say that for? What made him say that?
Strange, huh? Strange.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What else did he say, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He was scared. He saw these creatures coming
out of the woodwork. They were tryin’ to get him, he said.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How long had that been going on?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: A couple of weeks, I think.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He say what they looked like?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. Not really …</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse me a minute. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: In one end, out the other, huh George?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Still a spastic, huh? I hope you can hold your
dick better than you hold that can.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I know what Paul was talking about. I don’t
know how to say this … but in a way it’s a relief knowing that someone
else saw them, too.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You’re seeing … ?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They’re not human, I’ll tell you that. A car
tried to run over me the other day. It was aiming straight for me. I saw
their faces. They weren’t from Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: What are you tellin’ me? They’re from the
Bronx?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It was no joke, Rod.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Something weird is going on here. What is it
about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or
something?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, ever since that …</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: What’s that have to do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It was bad grass. That’s all it was.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Grass never did that to me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know, I’ve been to three shrinks and a
hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: It’s not worth goin’ over again and again.
Whatever happened, happened. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: … I’ve seen them, too.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So have I.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Look, there’s something fucking strange going
on here. You know Paul’s not the only one who’s died. You remember
Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue? His car blew up, too.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Dr. Carlson’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: An explosion, just like Paul’s.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You think they’re connected?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I think something’s fucking connect- ed. I
mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We’ve
got six guys here going fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Not me, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Okay, not you Rod. But the rest of us are
flipping out for some goddamn reason. They’re tryin’ to kill us. Fuck it
man, we need to find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Do you think it has something to do with … the
offensive?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s got something to do with some- thing. I
think we’ve got to confront the army. If they’re hiding shit from us, we
better find out what it is.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Come on, Professor. The army’s not gonna give
you any answers. You’ll be buttin’ your head against a stone wall.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Maybe that’s the only way to get through.
Besides, six heads’ll be better than one.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Not my head, buddy. Not me. I’m gettin’ a
headache just listenin’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: We should get ourselves a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I say you should get a shrink.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Too late. I’ve tried. I think you’re right,
Jake. I’m game.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You guys are fucking paranoid. It was bad
grass. That’s all it was. There’s no such thing as demons.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any
idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It’d
break your heart.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This isn’t injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did
something to us and we’ve got to find out what.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: The army. The army. What is it with you guys?
We’re not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United
States Government for God’s sake. This is red tape coming out of your
ass. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Exactly. And we need someone to cut through
it. We hear you’re the man.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Okay. I’ll look into it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wow! Do you think we have a chance?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: What do you want, a fortune teller or a
lawyer? … I’ll need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the
other members of the platoon, or their survivors.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, this is great.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: I’ll tell you, if we find the military is
implicated in any way, you could stand to recover quite a lot of money.
Not that I can predict anything, but some class action suits of this
kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements. That wouldn’t be so
bad, would it Mr. Singer?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Doctor. Ph.D.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Ah! I thought you were a mailman.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Then why aren’t you teaching? Why aren’t you
in a university?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m too messed up to teach.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Ah! Well then, they’re going to have to pay
for that, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: So tell me … am I still an angel?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: With wings. You transport me, you know that?
You carry me away.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: We’re all angels, you know … … and devils.
It’s just what you choose to see.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I love you, Jez.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Underneath all the bullshit, just love.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You know what? I feel … exorcised … like the
demons are gone.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: How come? The army?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: In a way. At least now I have some idea of
what was happening. If we can only get them to admit … to explain what
they did … I don’t know. Maybe it’d clear things up in my head. I’ll
tell you something, Jez, honestly … I thought they were real.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a
Manhandler. It’ll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad
together. It’s in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek.
Don’t drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He did? When?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: While you were in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: He didn’t give me a chance. Look, honey,
don’t get upset, but he’s not taking your case.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: He said you didn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I don’t know. That’s all he said. He wasn’t
very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They
chickened out, he said.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Baby, I’m sorry. I feel terrible. I’d stay
and talk but I’m so late. Look, don’t be upset. We’ll talk when I get
home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don’t brood. Watch T.V. or
something.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Frank. It’s Jake. Jacob SInger.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary.
He said the guys backed down. What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s right. We did.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What does that mean, Frank? I don’t get it.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Well, try, huh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know if I can. It’s just that war is
war. Things happen.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Things happen? What the fuck are you talking
about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s nothing to expose.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jesus Christ! Who’s been talking to you?
What’s going on? How can you just turn away? What about the others?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’re not interested, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shit! You know it’s not half the case if I go
it alone. We’re all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to
blame. They’ve done something to us. How can you not want to know?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe it’s not the army, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe there’s a larger truth.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe the demons are real.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is
that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen, Jake. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo …
?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m hanging up.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t bother to call again, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Geary! Mr. Geary! Listen, goddamn it! You
can’t just walk away from this.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who’s been talking to you? The army? Have
they been talking to you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Nobody’s been talking to nobody. You don’t
have a case, you hear me? It’s pure and simple. Now leave me alone.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: Take your hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Listen, will you listen? They’re trying to
get me. They’re comin’ out of the walls. The army’s done something to
me. I need you.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: You need … a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: A doctor? And what’s he gonna do, tell me I’m
crazy? They’ve fucked with my head. I’ve got to prove it. You’ve got to
do something.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: There’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: You mind? I’m eating, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Something’s going on here. You’re not telling
me something. What the hell’s gotten into you?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s gotten into me. I don’t
know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story
and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I’d check it out and I did. Now
I don’t know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and
abused me, and I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Used you?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: I talked to the Army’s Bureau of Records.
You’ve never even been to Viet Nam.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: It means that you and your buddies are
whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war
games in Thailand.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: War games? Thailand? That’s not true! How can
you believe that? Can’t you see what they’re doing? It’s all a lie. We
were in Da Nang, for God’s sake. You’ve got to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: I don’t have to do any such thing. I’m eating
my lunch, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You slimy bastard! You goddamn piece of
shit!</p>
<p><strong>geary</strong>: He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 1</strong>: Let’s go, Singer.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: You’re coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>army official #1</strong>: Mr. Singer. What an appropriate
name for a man who can’t keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who are you? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>army official #2</strong>: We’ve been watching you for a long
time. You and your friends. You’ve been exhibiting some very odd
behavior. Frightening people with foolish talk about demons - and
experiments.</p>
<p><strong>army official #1</strong>: You’re in over your head,
Mr. Singer. Men drown that way. The army was another part of your life.
Forget it. It is dead and buried. Let it lie.</p>
<p><strong>army official #2</strong>: I hope we have made our point,
Mr. Singer.</p>
<p><strong>santa</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>bearer</strong>: He’s been screaming like a madman. You
better get something in him.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Hi. I’m Doctor Stewart. Can you tell me
what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: My back. I can’t move. I need my
chiropractor.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Your back? Did you fall?</p>
<p><strong>bearer</strong>: They said he slipped on the ice. May have
hit his head.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Does he have any identification?</p>
<p><strong>bearer</strong>: No waller. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: They stole it.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know. Santa Claus. I had my son’s
picture in it. Gabe’s picture. It’s the only one I had.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: We better get an orthopedic man in here.
Is Dr. Davis on call?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’ll page him.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Call my chiropractor.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We’re doing everything we can.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: I’m going to have to move you a bit, just
to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. Don’t move me.</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: I don’t have to ask if you can feel
that.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it. I want Louis.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Who’s Louis?</p>
<p><strong>resident</strong>: He’s out of it. I’m taking him down to
X-ray.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where are you taking me? Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: You know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: Where do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Take me home.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: Home? This is your home. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I’m not
dead.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: What are you then?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: Then what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know. This isn’t
happening.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: What isn’t happening?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Let me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: There is no out of here. You’ve been
killed. Don’t you remember?</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: Remember?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No! That was years ago! I’ve lived years
since then.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: It’s all been a dream.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No! The army did this to me! They’ve done
something to my brain. Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I’m not dead! I
want my family!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He’s still pretty doped up. I don’t think
he’ll be able to talk yet and I doubt that he’ll recognize you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I just want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>jed</strong>: Dad. Hi. It’s us. We just found out.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You look terrible. Does that hurt?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’ll be outside if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jake. It’s me. We heard what happened.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not dead. I am not dead.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. Of course you’re not. You’ve just hurt
your back. That’s all. You’re going to be fine. It’ll just take some
time.</p>
<p><strong>jed</strong>: A month, they said.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You just hang in there, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s not funny. What a mess, huh? God I
wish there was something I could do. I love you, Jacob. For whatever
that’s worth. I do.</p>
<p><strong>“doctor”</strong>: Dream on!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No! Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jacob, what can I do?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Save me!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well, don’t we look better this morning? That
was a hard night, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Lennox Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m awake?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You look awake to me. Here. Drink some of
this.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where’s Sarah? Where did she go? She was here
…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No. No. You haven’t had any visitors.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s a lie. My family was here.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Last night! They were as real as you are!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This is not a dream! This is my life.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Of course it is. What else could it be?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jacob! Jacob Singer!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Louis! I’m here! In here!</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: You can’t go in there!</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: You’re going to have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Good God, Jake. What have they done? What is
this, the Middle Ages? And they call this modern medicine. This is
barbaric! Barbaric! It’s okay, Jake. It’s not serious. I’ll get you out
of here. What is this, the Inquisition? Why don’t you just burn him at
the stake and put him out of his misery?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: What the hell do you think … ?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t you come near me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What is this, a prison? Stay back.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 1</strong>: You can’t. Call the police.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You take one step and I’ll wrap this around
your neck.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hold on, Jake, we’re getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Half an hour from now and you’ll be walking
out of here all by yourself. Mark my words. Well, you’ve done it to
yourself this time, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Am I dead, Louis? Am I dead?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: From a slipped disc? That’d be a first.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I was in Hell. I’ve been there. It’s
horrible. I don’t want to die, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Well, I’ll see what I can do about it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’ve seen it. It’s all pain.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: spine like a master You ever read Meister
Eckart? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?
JACOB’s legs and yanks Good. Okay, let’s turn over gently. Right
side.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The other “right,” okay? You’re a regular
basket case, you know that? Eckart saw Hell, too.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You know what he said? The only thing that
burns in Hell is the part of you that won’t let go of your life; your
memories, your attachments. They burn ’em all away. But they’re not
punish- ing you, he said. They’re freeing your soul. Okay, other
side.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Wonderful. So the way he sees it, if you’re
frightened of dying and hold- ing on, you’ll see devils tearing your
life away. But if you’ve made your peace then the devils are really
angels freeing you from the earth. It’s just a matter of how you look at
it, that’s all. So don’t worry, okay? Relax. Wiggle your toes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Perfect. We got it. and the table rises back
Okay. Let’s just give it a little try. See if you can stand.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What? By myself?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a
try.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: There’s something I’ve gotta take care of,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What are you talking about? You can barely
stand.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m walking, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Jake, you need to rest.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I love you, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Listen to me. There were four companies in
our batallion. Five hundred men. Seven of us were left when it was over.
Seven! Four companies engaged in an enemy offensive that not one of us
who survived can remember fighting.</p>
<p><strong>bystanders</strong>: Use the torch!</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: Shut up! Let him talk!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You don’t forget a battle where 500 men were
killed. They did something to us. I want to know the truth, the goddamn
truth. We have a right to know. Are you getting all this? I want this on
national T.V. I want the whole country, the whole world to know.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Throw that torch away, young man. Give
yourself up. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: For what? For seeking the truth?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please come quietly.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You come near me and I’ll blow us all up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’re not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: Give him a chance to talk!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The army will deny it. They’ve falsified my
records. They’ve lied to my lawyer, threatened my buddies. But they
can’t threaten me.</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: You tell ’em!</p>
<p><strong>bystander</strong>: Use the torch!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay, let’s clear the area. Everyone out.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the fuck do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Clear the area. This is an order!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>onlooker</strong>: He’ll burn us all!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who’s there? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it! Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s just me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jezzie?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Who else were you expecting?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Where were you, Jake? Where’ve you been? Why
haven’t you called?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stay away from me, Jez.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I want to know. You tell me!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the
fucking news!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Why are you doing this to me? You can’t just
go away like that.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I can do anything I want.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It might be for me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not here. You haven’t seen me.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Hello … No. He’s not here. I haven’t seen
him all night … I don’t know when … What? Tell him what? Vietnam? … What
experiments?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello. This is Jacob Singer. God almighty! …
Yes. Yes. Right. Where would you like to meet? How will I know you.
Okay. I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit
out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I’ll know him when I see
him.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I have no idea. I was right. There were
experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: How do you know he’s telling the truth?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Leading the news tonight, a bizarre
demonstration on the steps of the U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters, in
downtown Manhattan. Jacob Singer, an alleged Vietnam vet …</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Alleged? Alleged?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … challenged the United States Army to
admit conducting secret experi- ments involving hundreds of American
soldiers during the Vietnam war.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Don’t leave me, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jacob? Hi. I’m Michael Newman. Friends call
me Mike.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Surprised, huh? I told you you’d know me.
I’ve been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I’d spoken to you
before tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t get it. Who are you? Why have you
been following me?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Observation, mainly. Clinical study. You
were one of the survivors.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on, we’re not safe around here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So first I’m arrested, right? Best LSD I
ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in
the joint, if I’m lucky. That was ’68.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Next thing I know I’m on Rikers Island.
Ever been there? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room
with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up
their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I’ll come
to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab,
they’ll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I’d only
been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn’t be
any worse.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shows how much you knew.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No shit. They had me by the balls. Next
thing I know I’m in Saigon … in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering
drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special
properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased
aggressive tendencies.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Right. They were worried. They figured you
guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your
anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even
a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the
Ladder.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The Ladder?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s what they called it. A fast trip
right down the ladder. Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I’m
tellin’ you, it was powerful stuff. But I don’t need to tell you. You
know.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We did experiments on jungle monkeys. They
bashed each other’s heads in, gouged out their eyes, chewed off their
tails. The brass loved it. Then they made us try it on Charlie. They
took these POW’s, just kids really, and put ’em in a courtyard. We fed
’em huge doses of the stuff. a tear rolls down his They were worse than
the monkeys. I never knew men could do such things. The whole thing
still blows me away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Anyway, this big offensive was coming up.
Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was
scared ‘cause they knew we couldn’t win. Morale was down. It was gettin’
ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Like it was yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A couple days later they decided to use the
Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in
the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure
your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn
offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, want something to calm you down? Made
’em myself.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: None of us can remember that night. I get
flashes of it but they don’t make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But
nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an
offensive?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A couple of days later. It was fierce. You
guys never saw it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: But there was an attack. I can still see them
coming. There was a fight, wasn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah. But not with the Cong.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who then?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You killed each other.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Oh my God! WHAT’S HAPPENING?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was brother against brother. No
discrimination. You tore each other to pieces. I knew it would happen. I
warned them. I WARNED THEM. But I was just a hippie chemist, right?
Jesus! And I helped ’em make the stuff … I talked to the guys who bagged
the bodies. They’re in worse shape than you, believe me. They saw what
was left. It’s a blessing you don’t remember. Of course the brass
covered the whole thing up right away. Blamed it all on a surprise
attack. I needed to find you. The Ladder was my baby.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I always suspected the effects might come
back. That’s why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting
hold of your records.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If you knew, why didn’t you say anything?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred
men died out there. This isn’t a story they’d ever want out. When Paul’s
car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant
business.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: So why tell me now?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Because I can get rid of the demons. I can
block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically
speaking. They’ll all disappear. It’s chemistry, my friend. I know. I
created it. Come with me. I can help.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You come here often?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sometimes. When it’s convenient.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How do I know this isn’t just some kind of,
you know, seduction or something?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey, I’m not the problem. You’ve got bigger
problems than me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I came up with the formula back in Nam but
I never got a chance to use it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’d hoped I’d never have to. Just open your
mouth and stick out your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t worry. Take it. It’ll free your head.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: “Yea though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death I shall fear no evil,” but no one ever said I
wouldn’t be shittin’ in my pants every step of the way, huh? Stick out
your tongue. eyedropper deposits a drop of liquid on the That’a boy. Now
why don’t you just lie down and relax.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: One drop?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s strong stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I think I’m falling asleep.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Pleasant dreams.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just relax.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s happening? Help me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t fight it. It’s your own mind. It’s
your own fears.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was better than you expected, huh?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And no more demons. I told you they’d be
gone.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t believe this. It’s a miracle,
Michael. A miracle.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Better living through chemistry, that’s my
motto.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to
me. You were there.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well that’s good to know.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Mike, it was real. It was glorious.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Glorious. I’m not surprised. I fed you
enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I’m just glad you came
back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I would have stayed there if I could.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m sure. You’ve got nothing but troubles
waitin’ for you here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Here. I’ve got every credit card ever
printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It’s on
me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What? You want the Plaza? Don’t be foolish.
Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It’s got my
phone, everything. Call if you need me … but you won’t. Everything’s
gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York
police can be effective when they want to be.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Save the words … Just send back my credit
card.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What are you doing here? Are you all right?
How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone’s looking for you, Jake. I
dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don’t know what
you’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m gonna make love to you. That’s what I’m
gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Are you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: God, I can’t keep up with all your
changes.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What’s gotten into you?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s amazing, you know, that a drug could
change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It’s hard
to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the
next.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like
a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s so hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: It’s your dinner, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I
was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stick with me, kid.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you
go.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s not practical, Jez. It’ll be hard enough
alone.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I can waitress. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. Things are too hot. Later. I’ll send for
you.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. I’m a marked man, Jez. I’m the only one
left. I don’t want to expose you to that. It’s not right for you or me.
Be reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake … You’re
gettin’ me angry.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I love you when you’re angry.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Oh yeah? Try leavin’ without me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Chicago. One way. For tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>seller</strong>: That’ll be $119.75.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it! hand. A pencil jabs his Fucking
pervert.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dream on!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You lookin’ for Mike?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t know. Hasn’t picked his mail up in days.
It’s not like him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m going to Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Sorry, Mac. Not with me you’re not. I get
lost in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I know the way.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Look, this is all the money I’ve got in the
world. Take me home and it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: … Where’s your home?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Dr. Singer. It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Do you want some help? I can call
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, don’t. But thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello? Is anybody home? Jed? Eli? Daddy’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Sarah, is that you? I hope you don’t mind. I
needed to come home.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Hello, Jake. I knew you’d come here in the
end.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’re you … ? Where’s Sarah? Where are the
boys?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Sit down, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No! What’s going on? Where’s my family?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s over, Jake. It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where have they gone?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It’s
finished.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Your capacity for self-delusion is
remarkable, Dr. Singer.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What’s wrong, Jake? Forget to take your
antidote?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who are you? What are you doing to me?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your
friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: And your vision of paradise … fantastic!
You’re a real dreamer, you know that? Only it’s time to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Your mind is crumbling, Jake. No more
“army.” No more conspiracies. You’re dying, Dr. Singer. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Where’s to run, Jacob? Where’s to go?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: How many times have you asked me that? How
many times?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: If you’re frightened of dying you’ll see
devils tearing you apart. If you’ve made your peace then they’re angels
freeing you from the world.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who is it? Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Gabe? Gabe!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Gabe. Oh God. I don’t believe …</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: Come on Dad … You know what we’ve got? A
sandbox just like the Williston’s, only it’s bigger and the sand’s all
white. You won’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>gabe</strong>: And my parakeet. Remember, the one grandma let
out of the cage? He’s okay. And he’s talking now. He knows my name.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Thus at the core of today’s discu- sion we
find four fundamental doc- trines. First, that the world of matter and
individual consciousness are both manifestations of one Divine
Reality.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Even you, Mr. Palmer, are part of it, as
amazing as that may seem.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Second, human beings are capable not only of
kowledge about this Divine Re- ality by inference but can realize its
existence by direct intuition, superior even to reason.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Third, man possesses a double nature, an ego
and an eternal self, what we call “spirit” or “soul.”</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Fourth, and most important, man’s life on
earth has only one end and purpose, to learn to let go of the separate
ego and to identify with the Divine spark within.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Almost impossible to believe, isn’t it
Mr. Palmer, that somewhere in that unconscious head of yours lies the
source of all consciousness?</p>
<p><strong>palmer</strong>: Yes, Sir. Very hard.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Well now, having reached this apotheosis
there seems little, if anything, left to say. So rather than try, you
are dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello Prof.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: My oh my. Doctor Singer. Isn’t this a happy
surprise?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Are you in the service?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: The postal service. I’m a mailman.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night
… I always admired that.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: And how is your wife? Sarah, no?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I haven’t seen her in months.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m with another woman now. We’re both with
the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Hmm. I don’t suppose there are too many
philosophers in the post office?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, you’d be surprised. They just don’t have
their doctorates, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in
the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring
freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though.
Middle of the war. The draft. They walk a moment in I’ll tell you Prof,
after Viet Nam … I didn’t want to think anymore. I decided my brain was
just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I
might agree. Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant
thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she’s living with?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I doubt it’s my mind that interests her. I
tell you Prof, she’s a fiery lady.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Well, try not to get burned. You have a great
mind, Jacob. Don’t let anyone tempt you away from it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’ve got a problem, Prof. More Augus- tine
than Kierkegaard, if you know what I mean. I need to know about …
demons.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing …
?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. I see them.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: See them? What do you mean? Physically?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I know very little about demons, Ja- cob,
fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones …
Dante, Milton … but Jacob, this is the 20th Century. We don’t see demons
now.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They’re
invading my life.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Christ, I know how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Have you considered a doctor? A psy-
chiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes. I don’t want them. I’m not looking for
analysis or drugs. It’s too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.
It’s more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You’re the only one
I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I need your insight, your intuition.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Demons? I don’t know what to tell you. It
sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you
have no context for it. You’re a renegade Existentialist suf- fering
demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make
it fit?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense. Please
help me.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Jacob, I don’t believe in demons, not in the
empirical sense. I don’t be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I
don’t believe in enternal damnation. I don’t believe in other- worldly
creatures tormenting us. We don’t need them. We do a good enough job on
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: But I see them.</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: Look. I don’t pretend to know what’s going on
inside your head. For all I know it’s pathological and they should be
pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you’re not willing
to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that:
then you’ll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It’s a
lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to
be pursued by … demons no less … There are no guides, Jacob. You wanna
know what I’d do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I’d hail the
first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock
treatment. I’m no saint.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hell, you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>stern</strong>: I’venever understood you, you know that? You
were by far the best pupil I’ve ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally,
you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe
you’ve been “elected” to see demons. Maybe you’re in touch with … some-
thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s burning up.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Total delirium.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s some gash. His guts keep spilling
out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Push ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I think we’re losing him.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: The Reverend Norman Murphy, leader of one of
the largest groups supporting the Armageddon Committee, told our cameras
that we are no longer dealing in decades but years.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The battleground is being readied. Our
planet is the battlefield. Our souls are the prize. All the signs point
to the inevitable confrontation between the forces of good and evil.
People must choose sides. There is no draft evasions in this war. All
are called. All must take up weapons. Are you prepared? That’s the
question we ask.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Do you find people scoffing at you, Reverend?
After all, there have been doomsayers for thousands of years and we’re
still here.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: People are less apt to laugh these days. The
prophecies are too close for comfort. I mean, all you have to do is
watch the news.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: There are some who claim that your pessimism
is defeatist and what the world needs now is hope, a positive
thrust.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I think the time for hope has passed. The
seeds have been planted. We shall reap what we’ve sown. Pessimists, no.
I think we are percieved as the only realists around.</p>
<p><strong>hayes</strong>: Other movement leaders agree. In an interview
…</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: So tell me … am I still an angel?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: With wings. You transport me, you know that?
You carry me away.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake, are you all … ?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake? Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s going to be all right, Jake. It’s going
to be all right. Don’t be afraid. I’ve got you now.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jezzie! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’re completely off your rocker, you know
that? You’d think you fell on your head instead of your back. What are
you planning to do, burn down the apartment along with your demons?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t you touch it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why won’t you answer me?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Cause you know goddamn well who I am.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’ve lived with me for two years.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That doesn’t mean shit. Where do you come
from, huh? And I don’t mean Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What do you want me to say? My mother’s
tummy?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You know goddamn well what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You’re out of your fucking mind. I’m not
gonna stand around here gettin’ interrogated by you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Well leave then. Go to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you
are? I don’t deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who
cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I’ve had it.
You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I’m done holding your
hand. I don’t want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Take it!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s been four days. No word. It’s not like
him. He’s never done any- thing like this before. It’s like he just
disappeared from the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The Bureau of Missing Persons is con-
founded by the continuing surge of reports …</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What’d you do that for? It’s an in-
teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the
street. Hey, what’s wrong? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m okay. I just don’t want to lis- ten.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You look upset.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m not upset.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You look terrible. What happened? stares at
him for a mo- Jake … is it the antidote?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn it. Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Look at yourself. You look like you’ve seen
a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Shit! Can’t I just have a bad day?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You can have anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Then don’t bug me.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I’m not bugging you. Come and lie down. I’ll
give you a massage. again and JACOB joins her. She unbuttons his Where’d
you go today?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Mid-town mostly.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Oh yeah? What was happenin’ there?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I picked up my ticket. I’m leaving in the
morning, Jez.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Oh? Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: West.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Where’s West? New Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t be funny.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I always liked the West, west of Il- linois
anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stop it, Jez. Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Do what? I haven’t done a thing.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t play games with me. There’s nothing
more to say.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake. What are you doing? Look, I’m sorry, I
didn’t mean to bite. Let me get you a towel.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake, don’t. You can’t leave. You’re not
seeing things clearly. The drug’s wearing off.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Jake, don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Hello? Is anyone home? Jed? Elie? Dad- dy’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Sarah, is that you? I hope you don’t mind. I
needed to come home.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Hello, Jake. I knew you’d come here in the
end.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where’s Sarah? Where are the boys?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Sit down, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No! What’s going on? Where’s my family?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: It’s over, Jake. It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Where have they gone?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It’s
finished.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: This isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: Your capacity for self-delusion is
remarkable, Dr. Singer.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: What’s wrong, Jake? Forget to take your
antidote?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of
fantasy. And your vision of paradise. A most romantic creation. You’re
quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it’s time to wake up.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: There is nowhere to run, Jacob. You’re
home.</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: How many times have you asked me that? How
many times?</p>
<p><strong>jezzie</strong>: You know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Still love me, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Stop!!!!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Daddy. Let go.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who the Hell do you think you’re
fighting?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh God, help me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I am with you, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s all right now. It’s over. You’ve won.
You’re here. questioningly. MICHAEL Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on. Don’t make me do it all. Stand up.
You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Stop hobbling. Your flesh can’t hold you
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Go on, Jacob. It has come for you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
