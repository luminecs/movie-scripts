<h1 id="the-flintstones">the-flintstones</h1>
<p><strong>2 the quarry foreman 2</strong>: looks down at his
wristwatch. Well… actually, it’s a wrist sundial. And it’s magic time…
quittin’ time… Millerock time! Now the foreman turns from his watch to a
steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the
workday –</p>
<p><strong>yabba dabba do – !</strong>: Fred happily discards his hard
hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino’s back, slides down
the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He
gets up to a running start with the only motor , slows to allow a “time
clock” dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he’s trotting back
up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: ‘Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They’re a
modern Stone age fam-i-ly –’</p>
<p><strong>4 continued: 4</strong>: Fred’s feet slap on the street as
the car starts up –</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: ‘From the Town of Bedrock They’re a page
right Out of his-tor-y –’</p>
<p><strong>the flintstones</strong>: And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we
–</p>
<p><strong>bedrock 1/2 mile. rock vegas, babylon &amp; eden next
three</strong>: EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and we
see – Bedrock!</p>
<p><strong>7 continued: 7</strong>: Nestled incongruously in a savage
landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn’s early
Spielberg light.</p>
<p><strong>9 a milkman 9</strong>: who returns the wave, then takes a
four-pack of stone bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a
doorway. As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big TORTOISE
with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise nods familiarly to the
milkman, then it waddles down the curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage
men take the cans off the Tortoise’s back, dump them into the truck.</p>
<p><strong>10 rear of truck 10</strong>: – revealing that the back of
the truck is actually a giant-jawed CREATURE strapped onto the chassis.
The garbage men dump the cans into its maw… it happily swallows the
works, licks its lips, BELCHES.</p>
<p><strong>tortoise</strong>: You can forget about a tip for
Christmas…</p>
<p><strong>12 following the round stones 12</strong>: They reach the
ends of their respective paths, dislodging a stick… that releases a
coiled rope which in turn spins a turntable which holds a little wooly
mammoth. As it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its
snout.</p>
<p><strong>little mammoth</strong>: Oh, my aching sinuses…</p>
<p><strong>14 int. bedroom - new angle 14</strong>: Two shapes are
visible under the bedclothes: One is a great SNORING bulge, the other is
a svelte and lithe shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger
bulge GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then finally
gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper is thrown without aiming
–</p>
<p><strong>15 the woodpecker 15</strong>: ducks just in time. It wipes
its forehead nervously.</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: I hate this job… There’s not even
a health plan…</p>
<p><strong>16 continued: 16</strong>: Perched on top of the wooden radio
tower are a monkey and an octopus. The monkey holds up cue cards which
the octopus reads, and then waves nautical semaphore flags.</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: Good morning, Bedrock. This is
station B-R-O-K with the morning weather and news…</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: It will be fair and mild through
the weekend, continuing for the next eight hundred years, followed by
cooling breezes and a protracted ice age…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wil-ma. Wil-ma? How about a great big good
morning kiss for your Freddy-weddy?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dino! Dino, cut it out – !</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: In the news, Bedrock civic and
business leaders met yesterday to discuss the growing kibble crisis.</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: Ecological activist Ralph Naderock
warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal- powered
civilization itself may be threatened.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dino, that’s enough – here, look, Daddy has a
nice dino bone for you, just please stop it –</p>
<p><strong>19 int. flintstone kitchen - day 19</strong>: Five-year-old
PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like
Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we
under- stand Fred’s romantic turn.</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: In other news, Bedrock police
report that the Xenosaurus has struck again! Yes, the fiercesome
intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month.
Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property
destruction…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down.
Your breakfast’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oooh, Dino, look – there’s a nice big dino
bone laying out on the front lawn – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Gosh, look at that adorable little female
dino –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – That animal’s gonna kill me with kindness.
Do you know we’re out of dino treats?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: So is everybody else in Bedrock. That kibble
crisis is getting worse every day.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’m afraid Dino’s going to have to manage on
leftovers from Pebbles and me.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: And what’s wrong with my leftovers?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’ll let you know when I see some.</p>
<p><strong>radio woodpecker</strong>: … Scientists from B.C. University
report that the footprints of the Xenosaurus match no known animal.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: Mommy, is the bad Ze-ze-zenosaurus gonna
get me and eat me up?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Of course not, baby.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s right, sweetheart. The only thing
that’s gonna eat you up is – me!</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: I’m still a little scared…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Pebbles, don’t worry. These stories are very
exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There’s no such thing as a
huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here
–</p>
<p><strong>lobster</strong>: Well, it beats working in a seafood
restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Thanks, Wilma…</p>
<p><strong>20 his pov - street 20</strong>: A paperboy on a
wood-and-stone bicycle is coming rapidly towards the house. In the
bike’s basket is a stack of dried, rock-hard clay tablets.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Arnold! Arnold! Don’t aim at the house –
please, not at the house –</p>
<p><strong>22 his driveway - through the other window 22</strong>: The
rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of
Fred’s car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood.</p>
<p><strong>23 back to scene 23</strong>: Fred sighs, turns back to his
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Lucky it wasn’t the Sunday paper.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah. What else can go wrong?</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. flintstone driveway - later 24</strong>: Fred – now
dressed for work – is forlornly trying to fix his car.</p>
<p><strong>24 continued: 24</strong>: In the neighboring driveway, Wilma
and Betty pile the kids into Betty’s car.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Come on, kids. Time for nursery school.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: ’Bye-bye, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: ’Bye, little sweetheart. ’Bye, big
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Nice morning, huh, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s nice about it?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Heh, hey. That Arnold’s got a real arm on
him, don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is the third ragtop this year … say,
shouldn’t you be at work?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we
kinda had a little adjustment –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You got fired, didn’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred, don’t start on me again. I donno, I’m
just not a nine to five guy. I got dreams, Fred. Ideas –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions
of yours. Be honest with me, Barn… tell me one thing you invented that
really caught on.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I invented fire.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You invented fire?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I told you that, Fred. But the coal
conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I
got lotsa other ideas –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread
on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante
royalties you get?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: If you ask me, pal, you’re just blowing smoke
up your own volcano…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Maybe, Fred. But first…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Let me try some of that smoke on your
car.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. barney’s garage/workshop - day 25</strong>: We can
still see Fred’s car in the neighboring driveway. . Barney’s garage is
cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and
scale models in different stages of completion. . Many of the models are
made of a strange celadon green material.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: – See, the first step, we make a mold of the
old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: – Add some lava granules… some woca leaves…
juice from two coo-coo berries…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Two coo-coo berries? You made of money,
Barney?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Anything for a pal, Fred – a lump of coal…
bamboo sawdust… eucalyptus sap… a touch of the La Brea tarbrush – and –
voila.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, why don’t you try inventing a brain
for yourself! Look at what you did to –</p>
<p><strong>26 continued: 26</strong>: He stops as Barney cranks up the
weight on a ratchet, proudly lifts out a perfect duplicate of the car
hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite himself, we…</p>
<p><strong>27 betty’s car - traveling 27</strong>: The two kids are in
the back seat. Somehow both of the kids’ faces are messy again. Working
together with beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the
rear armrests and door handles.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … Oh, it’s not that I’m complaining, Wilma. I
mean, Barney’s sweet, but… well, he’s just not cut out to punch a clock.
And he’s such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and
chisel and tried to balance a checkbook?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, Barney just keeps looking for that
coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don’t want to pop his balloon by
talking about the price of mastodon ribs.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. granite</strong>: Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted
to thank you personally.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe
their mouths every day.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. granite</strong>: No, no, I mean for all your wonderful
support the past few years. It’s parents like you that make me think
twice about retiring.</p>
<p><strong>27 continued: 27</strong>: From the schoolyard comes the
sudden sound of KIDS QUAR- RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. granite</strong>: On the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: We’re really going to miss you, too,
Mrs. Granite.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. granite</strong>: Have you found another school for the
children?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’re still shopping around.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fortunately, we’re both –</p>
<p><strong>wilma &amp; betty</strong>: – Professional shoppers!</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. bedrock street - travelling - day 28</strong>: Fred
and Barney drive along. houses and palms seem to be going by… duplex,
palm… . Barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or
so, it’s solid as a rock.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call
that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it’s a dino eat
dino world. You want my advice?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Did I ever?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You stick with me today, cruise on down to the
quarry and fill out a job application. I’m a big man there, Barney –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You’re a big man anywhere, Fred –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just
like this –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – just like that. I know, I know – you’re not
a clock-punching guy – but face it, Barney – it’s time to grow up and
put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the
ratasaurus race with the rest of us. It’s time to retire those
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney. Look.</p>
<p><strong>29 wide shot 29</strong>: They’re at the crest of a high wide
hill.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hey. Lava Lane.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race
our go-carts here to impress the girls.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yeah, those were the days… we usta dream
about coming back here some day with a real car and goin’ for the
goldrock…!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred… I thought you said it was time to
retire those old dreams.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey. Since when do I have to be
consistent?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh-oh! Fred, slow down – !</p>
<p><strong>32 the police car 32</strong>: cuts in front of Fred. Fred
SLAMS on the “BRAKES,” sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over,
grinning.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Well, Flintstone, looks like today’s the
day.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Sergeant Feldspar, I… I wasn’t speeding…
honest…</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Forget it, Flintstone. This time I got you
dead to rights –</p>
<p><strong>34 back to scene 34</strong>: Confident, Feldspar jerks a
thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I’ll
show you how we deal with scofflaws.</p>
<p><strong>radar bird</strong>: Whoa! Wings, do your stuff – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, Sergeant, if you don’t have a radar
reading, I guess we’ll – – justbeonourway – !</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Flintstone! Flintstone, come back here –
!</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. bedrock butcher shop - day 35</strong>: Betty and
Wilma have just pulled up. We notice that next to their legal spot, a
big limousine is parked in a “no parking” zone. But our law-abiding
Betty in the next space now drops a stone coin in a parking meter.</p>
<p><strong>little bird</strong>: Four years in accounting school for
this…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving
away Bronto filets?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ah, my two loveliest customers. It’s this
darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R… people are buying everything I got to feed
their dinos…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Young man, if you’re through flirting,
I’d like some service.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Of course, Mrs. Slate. Just take a
number.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: We met at the quarry picnic?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Ladies, the meat’s not getting any fresher.
Mrs. R, what’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, I’d like some ground mammoth patties and
uh… some dodo drumsticks.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Gino? We got any dodo bird?</p>
<p><strong>gino</strong>: There’s one left – and it’s the last one!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Good. Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with
this.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: How about you, Mrs. F?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I just need a few things for Fred.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: ‘Fred…’? David! Herman! Get Rob and BoBo and
tell ’em to bring the big dolly!</p>
<p><strong>voice from back</strong>: Flintstone again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: You got it. Now then… Mrs. Slate? You’re in
a no parking zone there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Well, if I get some service, I’ll be out
of it, won’t I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: I want a nice fresh, juicy
chickensaurus, Morris. And not one you’ve had laying around on the
shelf. I mean fresh.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Mrs. Slate, we’re kind of busy now –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: I don’t care if you’re busy. What I care
about is my adorable little grand nephew. He’s staying with me for the
summer and I intend to make his favorite dish… Southern fried
chickensaurus! Now I want a fresh chickensaurus and I want it now!</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Boys, you heard her… she said fresh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Morris, while you’re at it, I’d like it
plucked –</p>
<p><strong>40 continued: 40</strong>: Suddenly the chickensaurus snaps
the ropes, flaps its wings and leaps through the front window –</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. butcher shop - day 41</strong>: The huge bird lands
with a crunch atop Mrs. Slate’s car, which is practically squashed flat.
Then it disappears around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: My car – !</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. slate construction - day 43</strong>: Clouds of dust
rise from behind the fence. We see the heads of the heavy equipment
dinos rising and falling. A two-story office building is at one end of
the site with a big “Slate Construction Inc.” sign on the roof. CAMERA
ADJUSTS as Fred’s car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The
new green hood gleams in the morning light.</p>
<p><strong>44 closer - fred’s car 44</strong>: Fred digs his feet into
the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity.
Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred
acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, you won’t regret this – hiya, Al –
fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career’s another. Here, you’re
getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf – hi,
Wally, how’s the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the
ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo
–</p>
<p><strong>45 new angle 45</strong>: Fred stands near the weight station
booth, where a plump GIRL in a beehive hairdo sits inside a trailer.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi, Mr. Flintstone.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special
neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Here you go. Thanks again for the football
tickets. My boyfriend and I both liked them.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: My pleasure, Shirl. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Okay. But do you think next time we could go
to the same game?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you’re
in with Flintstone, you’re in like Flint.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I
just didn’t know how big.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. office - pullback from window 46</strong>: The room
here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale
construction project. There’s acres of little development houses, then
some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There’s even little
foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Uncle, if you’ll look at this unit cost
projection… it intersects here with –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: – how’d you like my fist to intersect with
your nose? I’ve told you a hundred times, don’t call me uncle in the
office! Now, I didn’t arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so
you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get
to the bottom slime!</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: You’ll be bankrupt in six months.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. quarry - moving shot 47</strong>: Fred and Barney
cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of
backslapping, waving. Barney’s filling out the forms on the move. Behind
them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry’s
sides.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Social Security number… dependents… ‘how
learned of job’ … newspaper ad, carrier pigeon… … Personal
reference…</p>
<p><strong>48 fred’s pov - a wrecking ball operator 48</strong>: A burly
and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in- side his dino-topping
cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball
towards the…</p>
<p><strong>49 quarry wall - above 49</strong>: – where the huge stone
BALL SMASHES into some walnuts balanced on a boulder.</p>
<p><strong>50 wider 50</strong>: Piltdown’s compact buddy PYRITE
cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one in
place. cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors that of</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you
can’t hit one on the fly.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Yer on, Pyrite –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Not again…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: All right, Piltdown, that’s enough! You’re
endangering your fellow workers!</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Yeah? Sez who?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Says me, Fred Flintstone – shop steward of
Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us
workers a snack break. So… … I’m breakin’ some snacks.</p>
<p><strong>52 up above 52</strong>: This time he’s overdone it: The
wrecking ball flies past the walnuts – Pyrite ducks for cover – and then
the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along
here, twisting as tightly as Indiana Jones’ whip. The handrail wobbles
dangerously in its foundation –</p>
<p><strong>53 piltdown’s dino 53</strong>: SNORTS, backs up – the crane
SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain –</p>
<p><strong>54 wider 54</strong>: Workers scatter, fearful of the
imminent collapse. Fred runs to grab the dino’s reins.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Whoa, whoa, big fella –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You’re on report, Piltdown! If it’s up to me
you’ll be pushing a wheelbarrow!</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: You’ve been asking for this, Flintstone…
I’m gonna kick your fat butt –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney – – Barney,
hold me back –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that
first.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Why should we?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick
Fred’s fat butt anytime.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah. That’s right. I mean – this ain’t over,
Piltdown. Come on, guys. Let’s clean up the mess.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. slate’s office - same time 57</strong>: Slate stands
in a blubbering fury as Lava mops coffee up from the model and Slate’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Bankrupt? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: It’s all here in hack and slice. When you
committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few
clams per ton. Since then, it’s gone up a hundredfold. You can’t build a
project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can’t afford
to feed those dinos.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: I’m two months behind schedule, my option’s
running out on the land and Donald Trumprock is just waiting to jump in
and steal the whole deal … meanwhile that damn union’s on my back, hell,
they’ll probably want an eighty hour week or something… There’s got to
be an answer…</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Sounds like a worker’s comp claim if I ever
heard one…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney! Grab that line! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>59 the crane 59</strong>: THUDS into place on the dino’s back
– the workers cheer –</p>
<p><strong>60 the wrecking ball 60</strong>: alas, with its cable now
twisted shorter, it’s become an immovable object, and as the shortened
CABLE SNAPS, the wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.</p>
<p><strong>61 new angle 61</strong>: Men and ANIMALS YELP and dive out
of the way as the BALL rolls downwards, SMASHING everything in its
path.</p>
<p><strong>65 slate and executives 65</strong>: react fearfully as they
realize all this is coming straight for them. With a howl, they all dive
aside –</p>
<p><strong>66 int. slate’s office - wider - day 66</strong>: The
wrecking BALL flies through the window, SLAMS onto Slate’s desk,
crushing everything in its path and then sails on SMASHING right into
–</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh boy. Goodbye pension fund –</p>
<p><strong>69 int. slate’s office - day 69</strong>: Dust is still
settling. The staff rises from the mess, coughing. Lava rummages in the
debris, finds a stiff body.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Uncle, Uncle, speak to me –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: I’m over here, you moron – and don’t call me
‘Uncle’!</p>
<p><strong>70 their pov - office 70</strong>: As they take in the
destruction. Barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model
buildings. As we watch, the last remaining little HIGH RISE FALLS.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hey, nice going, Fred. You even got the
spare –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, shut up – Mr. Slate – Mr. Slate – are
you all right?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: For five years Slate Construction has had the
finest safety record in Bedrock. Our workers are trained in first aid,
our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. And then
something like this happens … I want to know how!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Shut up! I want one person to answer me:
Who’s responsible for this?</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: That’s right, Mr. Slate, it was
Flintstone!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: That’s a lie, Mr. Slate!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: B. Rubble. White male personal reference
–</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to
you –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>fred piltdown</strong>: Huh? What?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: This stuff you had on your car is the most
incredible building material I’ve seen in thirty years in the
construction business! It’s strong – – Light – – Resilient –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Where on earth did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, it’s ah, just something I whipped up in
the old garage workshop – – with a little help from my buddy Barney,
right, Barn?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way
ar–</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Sure, Fred, right, right.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: The rest of you men go back to work. I want
to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move,
move…</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Light as a Pterodactyl feather… why, a child
could handle this… Lava, we could cut construction costs in half… in
quarters… in uh… whatchacallit –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Eighths –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call
this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, Mr. Slate, I call it – – Barney, what do
I call it?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fibrerock, Fred…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – I call it Fibrerock Fred – ! I mean, ah,
‘Fibrerock’!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: ‘Fibrerock’? ‘Fibrerock’? ‘Fib-bre-rock’
–</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: I love it!</p>
<p><strong>slate’s staff</strong>: Love it… great… has a nice ring… says
it all, you know?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: You see this, Lava? All those courses of
yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded
run-of-the-mill nobodies.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Boys, this is a small step for Slate
Construction… a giant step for all mankind.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: The Stone Age is over! Let the Fibre Age
begin!</p>
<p><strong>72 betty’s car - traveling - day 72</strong>: Mrs. Slate is
in back, crammed in with groceries. Betty pulls up in front of a
building that looks like a Palm Springs spa. This is “L’ECOLE DES
ENFANTS PREHISTORIQUE</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Here we are, Mrs. Slate. Sorry you had to
ride in the back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Not at all. I’m used to being driven
around.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. school - day 73</strong>: As elegant as we can get
MMMCXV years before Louis XIV. As the three women come in, we see
CHILDREN with alliga- tors on their deerskin shirts singing:</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: ‘La hachette de ma tante est sur le roche
de mon oncle –’</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Madame Mrs. Slate, bonjour! Welcome to
L’ecole des Enfants Prehistorique Haute Superior!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Thank you, Marie. I ordered the hors
d’oeuvres for the junior talent show. They were out of Ceolanth caviar
so I got Mastodon brie instead. Oh, ah, these are my, uh, friends, Wilma
Flintstein –</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Flintstone –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: – oh, it used to be Flintstein – ? And
this is ah, Becky… Betty!</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Enchante.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Well, Madame Slate, as you can see, we
remain ze creme de la creme in the croissant of life known as Bedrock.
Now, your leetle gran’ nephew will be wiz us for two weeks, no? Here is
ze application for him. An’ mais oui, he weel participate in zee annual
talent show, naturalment?</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: An’ your friends perhaps would like
zum school applications for zere enfants?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Them? Oh, Marie, really, you don’t
understand –</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s right, you don’t understand. My
husband’s business manager usually handles this sort of thing, but I
don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know Bam-Bam – – pardonez-moi, ‘Bem-Bem’
will love attending your school and performing in the talent show. Thank
you oh so much.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Let me have one of those, too. For ma petite
Pebbles.</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Of course. Any friend of Madame Slate
is a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>74 int. car - fred and barney - night 74</strong>: They’re
cruising along. Fred puffs on a cigar. Barney flips the pile of legal
sized tablets in his lap. In the back seat are some boxes and
bundles.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Gee, Fred, I don’t believe it. Eight hours
ago I didn’t have a job and now look – I got 1/2 of one percent of the
after-taxes after-expenses net breakage profits on Fibrerock!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Just be thankful I was there to go over the
fine print. It’s like I told you this morning – There’s something noble
about a man digging in with his hands and doing an honest day’s work.
Once you file those dreams under ‘old business’ and put your nose to the
plow, well, the world is your oyster. And was I right?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: No, Fred, you weren’t. I didn’t nose any
grindstones and you didn’t shoulder a wheel. We just hung out together
and everything that happened was a total accident.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Details, Barney, details… I just can’t wait to
see the girls’ faces when we tell ’em the news…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: It’s not like the boys to be so late.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Unless they were forced to go bowling again.
Remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, ‘go bowling
right now’?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Betty, sometimes you’re a little too gullible
–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Don’t tell me. I still can’t believe what I
did today…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: No kidding. Do you have any idea of what the
enrollment fee is? And get this… it’s non-refundable –</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know, I know! I just couldn’t stand that
woman’s attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we
were… the next thing I knew, I was in over my head… but why did you jump
in, too?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Oh, she was getting to me too with all that
mastodon snort about her little nephew… and…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: And… if a friend can’t help you do something
stupid, who can?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What do we tell the boys?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: What’s wrong with the truth?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We put ourselves in debt so the kids can
attend school with a family we can’t stand?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Maybe we could rephrase it…</p>
<p><strong>fred and barney</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Flowers?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Rock candy? That’s nice, but… why?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized
that we had a little spare change.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Not anymore you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Betty, these are for you. For sticking
beside me during the tough times, and well… for making a little guy feel
like he was ten feet tall.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Aw, Barney… I… I don’t deserve these. I did
something really stupid today.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hey. Fred does something stupid every day
and I still love him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Noogy, noogy, ha, ha – !</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Have you been drinking?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ready when you are. Hey, ‘1’… a good year.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, there’s no easy way to say this so
–</p>
<p><strong>76 favoring wilma and betty 76</strong>: They can’t believe
this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Boys… did you see… the dollar signs there at
the bottom?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: The non-refundable dollar signs?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: We see your dollar signs, ladies… and…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … we raise them.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Betty… these… these look… real –</p>
<p><strong>76 continued: 76</strong>: Fred opens the champagne, which
foams all over them. The girls squeal.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You bet they’re real, sweetheart. They’re as
real as… as… well, as real as – – the best darn friends and neighbors in
the whole world.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yeah. And nothing’s ever gonna change that…
right, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Right, pal o’mine.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. water buffalo lodge - night 77</strong>: A sign
proclaims this as “GRAND BEDROCK LODGE – LOYAL ORDER OF WATER BUFFALO.”
The parking lot outside is full of vehicles. We hear the sound of a
GAVEL BANGING…</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Attention, fellow Water Buffaloes…</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Brothers, your attention!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: The herd is now called to the prairie.
Antlers… up!</p>
<p><strong>entire group</strong>: Ack-ack-a-dack!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: This meeting of the Water Buffaloes is
now in session. Sergeant-at-Arms, have we got any old business?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Indeed we do, Brother Herdmaster. Tonight we
are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for Lodge offices, such
as good old Fred and some other guys.</p>
<p><strong>79 piltdown 79</strong>: Seated across the room with Pyrite
and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground,
and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the Herdmaster’s earlier call
to order.</p>
<p><strong>80 back to scene 80</strong>: After the CRY ECHOES away:</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Brother Piltdown: You have given the Cry
of the Gelded Buffalo at the Poisoned Water Hole. Do you wish to file an
objection?</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: You bet I do. How come Flintstone is ‘good
old Fred’ and me and the other candidates are just ‘some other
guys’?</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Yeah, how come?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to
rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old
guys… … plus the one and only Fred Flintstone!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: wooden, then</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: – crucible –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves
unscathed. Now, the future holds many promises and many problems. As
your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination,
courage and – if I may say so – bold thinking that I have brought to the
workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack.</p>
<p><strong>84 automatic pin spotter 84</strong>: It descends. It
consists of a bent snout creature which “cranks” down a shelf with
several monkeys on it. The monkeys grab the pins with their tails,
straighten them up. Then the shelf cranks back up.</p>
<p><strong>lodge member</strong>: Congratulations, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, when you’re hot you’re hot… boys, lemme
buy a round of drinks for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Thanks, Fred, but here at the lodge drinks
are free.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But the principle is the same, Barn. Don’t
forget that.</p>
<p><strong>86 under the counter 86</strong>: where he pulls out a
hook-beaked little LIZARD –</p>
<p><strong>87 back to scene 87</strong>: Fred uses this creature to open
several beers.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Here you go, boys, nice and frosty…</p>
<p><strong>“bottle opener” creature</strong>: Go ahead, laugh. If I had
a good orthodontist, my life woulda been different…</p>
<p><strong>88 under the counter 88</strong>: The critter bounces into
the shelf, slides… when it re- covers, it realizes that its overbite has
been straightened out by the impact. Very happy, it grabs a hat and
coat, exits.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, here’s to…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Here’s to the greatest bunch of lifelong
Buffaloes a guy could dream of leading. Anybody else got a toast…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: ‘Here’s to the Water Buffalo and their next
Herdmaster… Fred’!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Aw, gee, Barn… you shouldn’t say that… … at
least not till after next week’s election!</p>
<p><strong>lodge member</strong>: Fred, what was all that stuff in your
speech about the workplace? I thought the only decision you made there
was how many lunches to eat –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, Harry, it just so happens that old Fred
is moving up in the world… Boys, you’re looking at Mr. Slate’s new
partner.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: You and Slate? Who are you kidding,
Flintstone? The only partner you got is hanging over your belt.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Prepare to eat those words, Piltdown.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: – If I don’t, you will –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Gentlemen, my card –</p>
<p><strong>92 insert - card 92</strong>: Of course it’s a little stone
tablet… but it does indeed say “SLATE CONSTRUCTION – F. FLINTSTONE,</p>
<p><strong>lodge members</strong>: Hey, way ta go, Fred… Whoa, gonna
switch from a hard hat to a top hat, Freddy boy…?</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Ah, it’s probably a phony…</p>
<p><strong>94 barney 94</strong>: tugs Fred’s sleeve, pulls him
close.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Gee, Fred, how come I didn’t get any
business cards?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, it’s all part of the plan. Yes, boys,
you see, I went up to my pal, Mister Slate and single- handedly made him
an offer he couldn’t refuse –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – ‘Freddy boy,’ he sez to me, ‘We gotta talk
turkey –’</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred, we gotta talk turkey –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s right – just like that –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ah, excuse us, boys…</p>
<p><strong>95 new angle 95</strong>: Fred pulls Barney into a quiet
corridor. They stand near a trophy case. There’s some bowling trophies
here with a variety of names on them. “pie-eating contests” and “beer
drinking chug-offs”;</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred… what’s this single-handed stuff? I
distinctly remember at least four hands and two of them were mine.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, we could tell everyone how you
invented this Fibrerock stuff, how Slate and Lava found out about it by
accident and all, but what would that be?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: The truth?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: This is big business, Barney. We can’t start
telling the truth, it’d create the wrong impression. Think about all the
really big deals in history – back to the beginning of recorded
time.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What do they all have in common? I’ll tell
you. A front man. A guy who’s out in the public eye running the point,
fighting the crowds… and meanwhile… back in the corner is the silent
partner.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I never knew that.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That’s because the silent partner is always
silent.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But while you’re busy being silent – – all
along you’re the brains behind the operation and I’m the brains in front
of the operation. I’m out here running the guts of the operation but you
got a cut. It looks like my mind, but you’re really behind.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I get it. I got the brains, but you just
pretend to have them.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Attaboy!</p>
<p><strong>96 ext. flintstone/rubble houses - day 96</strong>: Barney
comes out of his front door, heads toward the neighboring driveway and
Fred’s car. Betty comes out, calls to her husband.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Barney, wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>97 closer 97</strong>: He stops, turns. Betty comes over and
we see he’s wear- ing a sports jacket and an abysmally-tied tie. Betty
fixes the knot.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There. That looks more like a captain of
industry.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Thanks, Betty. What would I do without
you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hmm. Probably run off to the tropics with one
of those executive secretaries.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Come on, Betty, it’s only my first day. You
have to have seniority to run off…</p>
<p><strong>98 fred 98</strong>: is at the car door, lunch pail in hand,
when Wilma calls out to him.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred! Wait a minute! There’s something wrong
with your lunch –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yeah… it does feel a little light…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fit for a king… my king.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Aw, Wilma… lookit, it’s got buckles, a strap,
a lock –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Baby, you’re the greatest.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Good luck. Watch out for those… you know…
hostile takeovers.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I’m already taken.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ah, Mister Rubble, I presume? Of the Fibrerock
Rubbles?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yes, yes. Looking good, Mister Flintstone. I
see you’ve recovered from that polo accident.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yas, yas. The water was too deep and my horse
drowned.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Ivan, look, okay, so I bought too much on
margin… everyone said glaciers were here to stay, I mean, who knew? Just
leverage my shares in Atlantis dry goods and – what? When did that
happen?</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Mister Lava, the armored car is here.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Armored car…?</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Yeah. Must be a fortune in coo-coo berries
on that baby. You know, for that Fibrerock stuff of Flintstone and
Rubble’s. You gotta sign here for it.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: I… I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>101 back to scene 101</strong>: Lava signs the form,
meanwhile looking Piltdown up and down. Finally –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Piltdown, this Fibrerock program is going to
create a lot of changes around the plant. I want to make one more.
You’ve been a wonderful thug and goon for me. Now, I’d like to expand
your duties. I want you to become a provocateur.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Gee, Mister Lava, I donno. I kinda like
girls myself.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: What I mean, is, I’m going to use you to
double-cross your Lodge and Union brothers, and make their lives a
living hell.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Good. You and your little pal will report
directly to me and take orders only from me. Now get out of here and
start screwing your former friends and associates.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Coo-coo berries…</p>
<p><strong>103 continued: 103</strong>: Feldspar looks every which way,
doesn’t spot them.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Gee, Fred, driving with you is better than
an ‘E’ ticket at Magerock Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Gets the old adrenaline going, Barn. Us big
executives, we need that kind of jolt to get the old wheels turning.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Flintstone! Rubble!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh, hi, Mister Lava.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Please, call me Jerry. Uncle – I mean, Mister
Slate told me to take you to your offices. If you’ll follow me…?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: The Fibrerock assembly line. Unc – Mister
Slate’s had a crew working on it all weekend. We’re going to roll out
the first sheets of Fibrerock by mid-week.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Yes, yes. Quick, dynamic entry into the
marketplace. I approve.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: But, Fred, it’s right where the employee
basketball court used ta be –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, you’re right… … Big business is hell,
Barney. Trust me… you’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I guess so. You already did.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as
you’re settled, come over to the assembly line. We’ll go over the
Fibrerock formula before the first run.</p>
<p><strong>104 inside trailer 104</strong>: There’re two tiny little
desks at the far end, separated by a flimsy divider. The single window
here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. Threadbare furniture on a
worn rug sits under a portrait of “Our Founder” .</p>
<p><strong>105 back to scene 105</strong>: Fred and Barney look at all
this in turn. Pause. Then they whirl, give each other high-fives.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: All-right!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Welcome to the top – partner.</p>
<p><strong>106 continued: 106</strong>: At one end of the building,
dino-powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these
get stomped/ chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is
then mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill-
type trough and is held back by a gate.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Ready… aim… fibre!</p>
<p><strong>107 the clay mold 107</strong>: gets “winched” unpwards by
monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail.</p>
<p><strong>108 below 108</strong>: Presto! A Fibrerock copy of the stone
sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces lightly on the conveyor belt
below! It sparkles with the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of
Fibrerock. As it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score of
identical sofas is in view.</p>
<p><strong>109 end of assembly line 109</strong>: as a beaming Fred
watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas . Nearby, we see
Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc.</p>
<p><strong>111 long matte shot - slate quarry - late afternoon
111</strong>: Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching
away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane’s warehouse. We see
everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock table lamps to Fibrerock
toilets. MUSIC OUT.</p>
<p><strong>112 closer - quarry yard 112</strong>: Fred and Barney,
weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day’s
incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them:
Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Men, this is a proud day for Slate
Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the
assembly line and into history… a history you are all part of… thanks to
your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: No longer will man and beast bend under the
backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber… because Fibrerock is so
light that even a child can handle it. That’s why on Monday we’re going
to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They’ll
be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22
laborers we’re laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final
pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City.
It’s non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>115 the quarry yard 115</strong>: The workers stand
slack-jawed and stunned.</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Laid off –?</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: Pink slip –?</p>
<p><strong>worker #3</strong>: Thanks to Fred Flintstone?</p>
<p><strong>worker #4</strong>: Flintstone! What kinda shop steward are
you?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred. You gotta do something about this!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I do? I mean, I do, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: That’s my Fred…</p>
<p><strong>117 inside the putting cup 117</strong>: A little MOUSE in a
complete hockey outfit jumps to catch the ball. Stopping it with his
little hockey stick, the Mouse gasps, raises its hockey mask.</p>
<p><strong>mouse</strong>: Whew. And it’s still pre-season.</p>
<p><strong>118 back to scene 118</strong>: Slate tees up the ball again.
Fred barges in, banging the door. Startled, Slate drives the ball
instead of putting it. It sails across the room and SHATTERS a PICTURE
of Mrs. Slate.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Flintstone!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Mr. Slate – we gotta talk –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: We do, eh? About what?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: About those guys outside, Mr. Slate. Some of
’em, well, they been here for years. And you, well, you can’t lay them
off just like – – that!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Of course I can, Fred. I can lay them off
like – – that, or like – – that, or like –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: – that.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, you can, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Of course he can, Flintstone. It’s his
quarry.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: That’s right. Why – I could lock the front
door and go fishing if I wanted!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Why, I could even fire Lava here if I
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Or… I could fire you, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Me! Ah, ha, that’s rich, Mr. Slate, that’s
–</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Flintstone, Lava, here, recommended that you
be in charge of public relations to get Fibrerock off to a good start.
I’m a member of that public, Flintstone, and I have to say… this isn’t a
good start. I’m getting a bad feeling about Fibrerock. A bad feeling
about… you. You want that feeling to go away, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Uh… well, gee, I… uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Good. Then turn around and walk out of here
and we’ll forget all about this.</p>
<p><strong>workers</strong>: Well? What’d he say…? Ol’ Freddie boy told
him a thing or two… Probably got us a raise… Right, Fred…? Fred…?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Akkk… something… noble… man … job… nose…
wheel… shoulder… grindstone… hommm… yggggg…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred?</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. flintstone &amp; rubble lawns - day 121</strong>:
Betty and Wilma stand, determined, while the kids gripe.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: But, Mommy, I wanna go roller skating…</p>
<p><strong>bam-bam</strong>: Yeagh… ’hend thugh guys wher ghoing – – to
play rockball at Paleolithic Park –</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, you’re both going to change your plans.
Your new school is going to have a talent show… and you’re going to have
some talent.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: You don’t have to win… honorable mention or
most Kongenial Kids is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: As long as we beat the pants offa
Mrs. Slate’s nephew…</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Young lady, this is not about beating pants,
this is about becoming a well rounded child. Now, what kind of act will
you do?</p>
<p><strong>bam-bam</strong>: How about a disappearing act?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’re waiting.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles bam-bam</strong>: … Wanna recite something? Nah, what
are we, little ‘Inky Dinky Spidersaurus…’? kids? How ’bout magic</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: But then we’d need a hammer BAM-BAM and
chisel… oh, what about That dumb thing? You that thing with Dino? think
so…?</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: Okay. We’re gonna sing a song with
Dino.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: A one-and-a-two and-a –</p>
<p><strong>122 continued: 122</strong>: The kids tie down a jump rope
and Dino does a wire</p>
<p><strong>the kids</strong>: You can keep the Twist, The Frug and Hop I
don’t need to Shimmy, I don’t need to Bop ‘Cause I’m doin’ doin’ doin’
The Igneous Rock!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well? Think they’re ready for the talent
show?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I think they’re ready for Rock Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Fellow Water Buffalo. In a few moments
we will cast our votes for the lodge officers.</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: The election committee will make the
preparations.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Since when do you have to prepare for a
landslide, right, guys?</p>
<p><strong>125 continued: 125</strong>: Pause as Fred waits for a reply.
He turns… SHOT WIDENS as he realizes no one is sitting near him. He
looks around and sees –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barn – w-what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: They’re mad at you, Fred… it’s
understandable, I mean, they all got laid off today –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Guys, guys, come on now – what’s a quarry
fulla layoffs got to do with a lodge fulla Buffaloes?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Is that a riddle? Give me a second –</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: I’ll tell ya what! Mosta the guys in this
lodge work for Mr. Slate –</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: – You mean used to work for him – until
somebody opened their big mouth –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fellas, come on. We’re all big boys here –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Surely we can separate in our minds work, and
play… Job, and Lodge…</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Candidate and double-crossing back
stabber? Herdmaster! I move we commence the meeting… and the
election!</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: I second the motion!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: All in favor, say –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wait, wait… Your Antlerness, please, one
second – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, you gotta tell the other guys what
really happened. Tell ’em the story behind Fibrerock. The true
story.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Well, there’s not much to tell. True, I got
a cut… but Fred’s got a gut.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, no, the rest –!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh, yeah, I remember! I got the mind, but
Fred’s got the behind. Right, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Thank you, Brother Rubble. The Buffaloes
will now have their secret vote. Fit… furs!</p>
<p><strong>127 continued: 127</strong>: Everyone pulls their horned
fezzes down over their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Paw… ground!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: All for Piltdown, bellow now!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: All for Flintstone, bellow now!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: Order furs!</p>
<p><strong>herdmaster</strong>: The snorts have it! Brother Piltdown, it
is my privilege to install you as the new Exalted Herdmaster Erect
Antler and Big Buck of our Lodge. If you’ll come forward, I will present
you with the tokens of office.</p>
<p><strong>128 favoring fred and barney 128</strong>: Fred’s a broken
man. Barney moves over, puts his arm around him.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I voted for you, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Big deal, after you screwed everything up in
the first place…!</p>
<p><strong>129 wider 129</strong>: Piltdown accepts the festooned fez
and shoulder ribbon, smiles at the group.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow
Buffaloes, I’m a man of few words. It’s no secret that most of our lodge
members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101… which means that
most of us aren’t gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So
my agenda for tonight… ends right now. There’s a time to be a Buffalo…
there’s a time ta be a brown nosin’ double-crossin’ creep…</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: … and there’s a time to stand up and be a
man! So let’s go down there and make the Slate shop into slate scrap…
then we’ll see how he gets along without the heavy equipment operators
of Neolithic 101! Meeting adjourned!</p>
<p><strong>130 buffalo lodge - recreation area - night 130</strong>:
Fred is at the bar, opening a beer. He looks wistfully at the old,
framed picture on the wall – reacts as he sees –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred! Fred! The Buffalo are heading for big
trouble – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No kidding. They rejected the best candidate
–</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: No, no, not that! Piltdown’s got the guys
all worked up and they’re heading down to the quarry! They’re gonna
wreck the assembly line!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, no! That – that’s horrible! We could end
up with half a percent of nothing!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: No, Fred, if they do that they’ll be
breakin’ the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah, that, too… come on, Barn, we
gotta stop ’em!</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. slate quarry - night 133</strong>: Silent, empty.
CAMERA PANS FROM the still yard TO the gate. Down the road, we see
Piltdown leading the angry mob. Quickly, they go to the gate, climb up
and over it!</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Okay! Let’s start with Slate’s golf
trophies and work our way up to the assembly line!</p>
<p><strong>134 in car - fred and barney - night 134</strong>: Both
pedaling like mad.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t believe this… how did things ever get
this out of hand – ?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I know. Makes you wish things were back the
way they were… before we was big executives.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t go that far…</p>
<p><strong>135 feldspar and gravel 135</strong>: Coming up from rear.
Feldspar grabs his megaphone as he pulls abreast of Fred.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Flintstone! Pull over!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh, no, not now…</p>
<p><strong>136 close on fred’s feet 136</strong>: He slams them down
through the floorboard –</p>
<p><strong>137 wider 137</strong>: Fred’s CAR SKIDS, spins out, whirling
around like a record on a turntable. It jerks to a halt 180 degrees
later, and then ROARS off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: Sarge! Look out – !</p>
<p><strong>140 new angle 140</strong>: As we see that the water spout is
actually coming from the blowhole of a whale which now sticks a bit of
its head up from under the broken curb.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m gonna sue you for everything you got
–</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Now we’ll show ’em who’s boss!</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: They can’t push us around!</p>
<p><strong>142 rear of quarry - night 142</strong>: Fred pulls into the
lot, slams his feet down to stop – we hear SKIDDING – they fishtail all
over, slam right through a storage area for crates and barrels which
collapse all around them.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barn! Did you see that – ? – Huh, now it’s
gone… I coulda sworn…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Come on Fred. Time to earn those big
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Darn that Flintstone and Rubble… they’re
gonna screw everything up…</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Not if we give ’em a nice long vacation…
in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Stee-rike one! Heh-hey. Ready for a curve
ball?</p>
<p><strong>146 piltdown 146</strong>: Spits on his hand, grabs another
big beam. He pulls down on it… but it doesn’t snap, it goes right up
again. Puzzled, he pulls down on it again… there’s another see-saw
motion… … This time Piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers
under the beam…</p>
<p><strong>147 new angle 147</strong>: Fred is hanging on the other
end.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Brother Piltdown… can we talk about this,
antler to antler?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Guess not…</p>
<p><strong>148 barney and pyrite 148</strong>: Square off in the
rafters.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Give me your best shot.</p>
<p><strong>149 fred 149</strong>: Is backpedaling away from Piltdown on
the upper super- structure of the assembly line. Fred scrapes one foot
in an arc in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dare you to cross that line.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: That line.</p>
<p><strong>149 continued: 149</strong>: Piltdown crosses it. Fred
“marks” another one. Piltdown doesn’t even wait for the challenge, takes
a giant step. Oops. Bad idea: The last “line” was at the edge of a
straight drop! Piltdown yelps, “treads air” in the best cartoon manner –
and then desperately grabs a handful of Fred’s clothing! Both men fall –
at the last minute Piltdown catches a ladder!</p>
<p><strong>150 below - assembly line 150</strong>: Fred lands with a
thud right in the clay mold used to form the Fibre products! Worse, the
impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep. Dutifully, they
rise, and then ram both sides of the mold just as Fred is struggling to
his feet! Fred’s yell is muffled by the clay.</p>
<p><strong>151 other assembly line animals 151</strong>: Aroused by the
“start up” of the assembly line, they do their job. Fibre foam begins to
chug down the trough: The alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes
it.</p>
<p><strong>152 fred 152</strong>: is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly
caked in clay.</p>
<p><strong>154 below 154</strong>: The real Fred, moving stiffly like a
robot, is getting to his feet when his Fibre doppleganger slams him to
the mat again! A moment later, another “Fred” drops down beside him.</p>
<p><strong>155 piltdown 155</strong>: Has descended the ladder, hopping
mad. Now, he sees Fred coming toward him… Piltdown breaks a big lever
off the equipment, swings – reacts astonished as “FRED”</p>
<p><strong>157 piltdown 157</strong>: Watches, confused, as dozens of
Fred Flintstones chug towards him on the belt. He shrugs, smashes the
next one in line. Another phoney. He smashes the next one…</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your
head?</p>
<p><strong>159 wider 159</strong>: The alligator crane swings him away
and over a big bin marked REJECTS – and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls
into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods.</p>
<p><strong>160 barney 160</strong>: Chuckles to himself… and then looks
down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet
another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that
he’s just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps
into it – slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log
Flume ride –</p>
<p><strong>162 the end of the building 162</strong>: where a squad of
policemen has just appeared – led by a dripping wet Feldspar and
Gravel!</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: All right! You’re all under arr –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Whattya know. Even got the spare again…</p>
<p><strong>163 int. bedrock police station - night 163</strong>: Wooden
bars delineate the holding cells. “Wanted” posters of stone are hanging
on the walls. As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by
friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone
money on the night sergeant’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Barney, I don’t understand… what came over
you boys?</p>
<p><strong>exiting buffalo</strong>: ’Night, Barney. So long, fatso.</p>
<p><strong>buffalo #2</strong>: See ya, Barn. Flintstone, you’re dead
meat.</p>
<p><strong>buffalo #2</strong>: ’Night, pal. ’Night, slimeball.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, is there something you want to tell me
about the lodge meeting?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it. Besides, who
cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads?
I’m more of a country club guy myself anyway…</p>
<p><strong>164 ext. police station - night 164</strong>: Lava stands in
the shadows beside his Porscherock. Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In
the b.g., Fred and Wilma drive away.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: A simple little heist – I gave you everything
but the keys and you blew it –</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Hey, we got the union guys to break in and
create a distraction, didn’t we? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would
show up, too?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: The day after Slate City opens there’s going
to be an audit. If the stuff isn’t gone by then we’ll all be doing time
until the Bronze Age.</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Don’t worry, Mister Lava… we’re on top of
it.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Excuse me, Mister Lava – ? I think you
oughta know… something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: How do you know that? I mean… ah, why do you
say that?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It tastes different.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Tastes… different?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yup. See, ever since I started with
Fibrerock – I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a
little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight’s batch, well… I didn’t get
much of it, but it seems a little off. Can’t fool the old taste buds,
heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I’ll
run a couple of tests and stuff –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Rubble, Rubble! We’re fighting a deadline to
finish Slate City… and we’re not pulling the plug on production to
satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are
overworked … overwrought… how long have you been with us, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Nine days, Mister Lava.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you’re so run
down.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: I’m authorizing a nice vacation for you,
Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent
something… hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II – ?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: No, don’t try and thank me.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. slate’s office - day 165</strong>: Slate and Lava
are examining a newer and larger model of Slate City. It’s even more
grandiose than its predecessor. Now the housing development has two huge
office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond
that.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: … As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light
we’re using it for construction, for furnishings… for everything. You
can’t stack a two-bedroom cave this high… but the sky’s the limit with
Fibrerock!</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: ‘Sky’s the limit’… ‘sky’s the limit’… why,
these two buildings, they… they practically scrape the sky! We should
call them… Slate scrapers!</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: That’s brilliant, Unc… Mister Slate. In fact,
maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex… … I wanna
call ‘em the FibreSphere and the’____’ something Needle… but I just
can’t…</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: How about, ‘Slate Needle’?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: ‘Slate Need…’ … How do you keep coming up with
these? It’s uncanny.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: It’s a gift…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you…
just a few overruns … minor cost problems… that’s it… thank you…</p>
<p><strong>165 continued: 165</strong>: Slate’s so busy admiring his
moment to himself he hardly listens to what Lava’s saying, just runs his
stylus through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile “framing” the
model city in his hands.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: … Oh, Mister Slate, we’re going to hold the
Bedrock Junior Talent Show in the uh, ‘Slate Needle.’ Good for public
relations –</p>
<p><strong>166 lava’s pov - quarry below window 166</strong>: A small
figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to
cabinet and thus towards the assembly line. Wearing sunglasses with
attached nose and a hook-on beard, it at first appears to be some sort
of bizarre hermit or bum… and then we realize, hey, this is Barney!</p>
<p><strong>168 below - piltdown 168</strong>: Reacts as the trophy
bounces off his head, then looks up to see Lava gesticulating. Piltdown
nods, grabs Pyrite in tow.</p>
<p><strong>170 piltdown 170</strong>: – who looks down at him with a big
smile, Pyrite at his side.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Can we help you… sir?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Ah, yup, yup, young feller… jest show me the
way to the personnel office… I’m lookin’ fer a job as a custodian…</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Ya can start by cleaning the street with
your pants!</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: That takes care of the half-pint. Now to deal
with the half-wit.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. lava’s office - day 172</strong>: Lava walks Fred
from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … But Barney doesn’t want to take a vacation –
he says he’s gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: – Oh? Or check up on us?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Flintstone, that… that’s a slap in the face of
our founder… our employer… our uncle. Unless, of course, you agree with
Rubble… that Mister Slate isn’t capable of running this operation … that
I’m not capable of running it?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Of course not, Mister Lava. But –</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Call me Jerry. Sit down, please…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: … Cigar?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Why, yeah, sure, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men
– you and me, for instance – we’re cut out for the big time, the big
bucks… … the big everything.</p>
<p><strong>173 closer - gizmo 173</strong>: It’s actually a frame
supporting a little LIZARD. The Lizard bites the tip off the cigar,
practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with
difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>lizard</strong>: When they say smoking is bad for your
health, they’re not kidding…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: And others? Wellll…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: … Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part
in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, actually, I wouldn’t say small part… I’d
say…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … Kind of a medium-sized… well, almost
medium-sized… well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of
–</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: You’re too kind, Flintstone, that’s what I
like about you. But you’re a big guy with a big decision to make. Are
you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out
of the fire… or are you going to concentrate on your own important
duties?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, gee, that’s tough one – – Uh, what are
my important duties?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Publicity, Flintstone, publicity!</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: And that’s why I’ve got a little surprise for
you… for the man who made Fibrerock a household word, I want you to meet
the man who’s going to make you a household word…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: R-rockin’ Leach?</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: ’Ello, Fred. I’ve ’eard a lot h’about you
from Mister Lava. H’at’s why we’re going to put you on our program.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: M-me? On – on television?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this
nonsense about Barney.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney who?</p>
<p><strong>178 closer - yard 178</strong>: Rockin’ Leach is surveying
the place with an aide. Fred and Wilma are with them. Leach makes a
“frame” with his hands, “pans” the area.</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: Hmm. Lovely little guest ’ouse, Mister
Flintstone. So simple, so ordinary, so unexceptional… why, h’it’s almost
quaint. Let’s say we start with the camera ’ere, except…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: W-what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: Well, just look at that yard over there…
barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Maybe you could move those plants to block
them out…?</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: Good idea. Rodney, get ‘hoppin’ with those
greens.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, this was supposed to be a ‘typical
evening’ at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don’t even
know. Now what’s going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s the Rubble yard, Wilma. It’s just not the
right image…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know why you want to go to this
thing… after the way Fred’s been treating you lately –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred’s in a high-powered executive job,
Betty. There’s a lot of pressure on him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah… and it’s all around his belt. If it
wasn’t for poor Wilma I wouldn’t give him the Geological Time –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut,
he’ll be the same old Fred.</p>
<p><strong>180 their pov - the fence 180</strong>: The television crew
has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the
big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or
thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney
and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully
as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath.
One last stray end lands on Barney’s head.</p>
<p><strong>bird</strong>: I’ve heard of a flash in the pan, but this is
ridiculous…</p>
<p><strong>182 continued: 182</strong>: Finally, they’re done and leave
him.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now… the man who brings you the
romance and excitement you crave… from the casinos of Monte Carlrock to
the glamour of Hollyrock, here’s your guide to the Rockstyles of the
Rich and Famous, Rockin’ Leach!</p>
<p>****: Good evening. Tonight we come to you live from the ah… charming
pied a terre of the man of the ’our, Fred Flintstone –</p>
<p><strong>184 his pov - fred 184</strong>: He has just carved
“FREDERICK” into a stone cue card and points to it.</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: ‘Ere we are at the ’ome of Bedrock’s man o’
the ’our, Frederick Flint–</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: ‘Ere we are at the fabulous ’ome of Bedrock’s
man o’ the ’our, Frederick von Flintstone –</p>
<p><strong>187 near the house 187</strong>: Barney and Betty appear,
Bam-Bam in tow. They come out into the yard. Betty waves at Wilma, who
comes over, whispers.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Thank heaven. There isn’t one person I know
here.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You mean beside Fred?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I mean including Fred.</p>
<p><strong>188 the set 188</strong>: Where Leach has pulled Fred on
camera. Fred is posing, fluffing his ascot, etc. We notice a “FVF”
embroidered patch on his jacket.</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: Frederick, of course, is the man behind
Fibrerock – the invention that some predict will revolutionize life in
the future. Frederick, ’ow does it feel to know that you ’ave personally
brought the Stone Age as we know it to a long-deserved end?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, Rockin’, you’re right, I have affected
destiny for all mankind, and it’s a sobering thought. However, if I may
add a personal note at this time, I myself cannot personally take all
the credit for Fibrerock…</p>
<p><strong>189 wilma, barney, betty 189</strong>: react with hopeful
expressions –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: See? What’d I tell ya?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: No, I could never have done it without the
inspiration and support of a very special person. I’m speaking, of
course, of my close friend and associate, Mister Slate, founder and
C.E.O. of Slate Construction…</p>
<p><strong>193 close on “slate needle” and fibresphere 193</strong>:
Both decorated in pennants and bunting, connected to each other by a
gangway six stories up. Block letters on the Fibresphere proclaim “Slate
Construction brings you THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF FIBRE.” A heroic statue
of Slate himself stands close by the structures. needle, of course, are
dead on parodies of the Trylon A limousine pedaled by two chauffeurs
pulls up. Mr. and Mrs. Slate and Lava, and Lava’s son, POINDEXTER, get
out. It is immediately evident that the little obnoxious acorn hasn’t
fallen far from the tree.</p>
<p><strong>poindexter</strong>: Wow! Is this ever keen! Dad, you promise
I can cut in all the lines?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Of course, Poindexter, of course.</p>
<p><strong>194 resume - flintstone house 194</strong>: The party is in
full swing.</p>
<p><strong>194 continued: 194</strong>: We see Pebbles and Bam-Bam
squirming uncomfortably in their party clothes. They take some canapes
off of a table, take a bite… spit them out.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya… glad
you could make it…</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Hello, Frank…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fred – there’s the bar, make yourself at home
– mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that –</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, can I talk to you – ? Fred? Fred? We
have a serious problem with Betty and Barney.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You mean you can see their house – ?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: I mean you’re treating them horribly! What’s
come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you
just turn your back on the things that really count?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wilma, I’m shocked. I wouldn’t do that. Okay,
I admit it: I’m trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I
wanna be a success…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … But deep down inside, I’m still the same
lovable guy you married – – Frederick von Flintstone the third –</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Arrrgh – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>196 production assistant 196</strong>: Hangs up the sea shell
phone, runs over to Leach.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: That was our location guy at Slate City. They
just moved the ribbon cutting up by an hour. Guests are already starting
to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>leach</strong>: Fabulous! I’ve ’ad enough crab meat and
crabgrass to last me a year. All right, boys, that’s a wrap!</p>
<p><strong>197 fred 197</strong>: In the middle of a tight little group
which is pigging out. Fred seems oblivious to the fact that they’re
oblivious to him.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … Yas, yas, it’s a challenging commodity
market these days. Personally, I’m considering petrified forests, but
they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: … Hey, whoa, what’s happening –</p>
<p><strong>leach’s aide</strong>: What’s happening isn’t happening here.
The action’s over at Slate City. Oh, thanks for the booze, Ed –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Fred!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hey, what’s the hurry? We got a cake shaped
like a piece of Fibrerock… I got it, how about some charades? No, even
better, twenty questions: ‘Am I animal, mineral, or fossil’…? Oh, I
heard a great one the other day … a guy walks in a bar with a
duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says – this’ll kill you, the
bartender says –</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred… I… I’m sorry it’s not working out…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Whaddya mean, not working out? They’re goin’
party hopping, that’s all. That’s what ya do in society, Wilma… you
cruise around. They’ll go over to Slate’s shindig for a while, then
they’ll come back here.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: You go on over to Slate City, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred, I want to be here with you –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Nah, me and some of the guys from the country
club, we’re gonna play poker, yeah, big stakes poker until everybody
comes back. Go on with the others. The kids got their show to put on
anyway… and I wouldn’t want people to think… to think the Flintstones
were party poopers.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Come on, Pebbles. We’re going to another
party.</p>
<p><strong>pebbles</strong>: Will there be real food there?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: We’ll find out together.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Wilma, wait. I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If friends can’t do something stupid, who
can?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Besides… … Maybe if we leave the boys
alone…?</p>
<p><strong>199 rear of yard - night 199</strong>: Fred sits forlorn in
the rubble of his party. Dino comes over, nuzzles his leg.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That’s okay.
Man and man’s best friend.</p>
<p><strong>202 back to scene 202</strong>: Fred stares at it, his face
slowly darkening. Then he grabs a lawn chair from the yard, begins to
smash it in a fury against the divider. The wall cracks, splinters; the
potted plants go flying.</p>
<p><strong>203 fred 203</strong>: His anger spent, he stands panting,
splattered with dirt… then he sees –</p>
<p><strong>204 new angle - another dirt-covered figure 204</strong>: –
standing in the ruins of the wall. The figure sneezes, whacks dirt off
of itself. It’s –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: B… Barney?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hiya, Fred. Boy, the rental place is gonna
be mad… … You feeling better, pal?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: ‘Pal’? How can you call me that? Barney, I…
I’ve been such a… such a… such a…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Creep?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well, yeah. But more of a –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fool?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Slimeball? Louse? Jackass? Stuck-up
blimpasaurus?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney… can… can you ever forgive me for being
such a jerk?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Sure, Fred. I’ve had lots of practice.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Aw, Barn…</p>
<p><strong>206 the fibresphere “world of fibre” ride 206</strong>: The
cupolas rattle along in Disneyland style, passing a sign which reads:
“FIBREROCK–TRANSFORMING THE HOME.” Here, mechanical figures in an
all-Fibre home move klutzily around the room.</p>
<p><strong>recording</strong>: Welcome! Welcome to the fabulous world of
tomorrow… a world brought to you by Fibrerock!</p>
<p><strong>207 reverse angle 207</strong>: REVEALING that behind the
hollow shells of the human family is a veritable family of monkeys, all
working the figures like puppets. A PARROT at a stand-mounted microphone
is giving the narration.</p>
<p><strong>parrot</strong>: Here, we see a typical family of the future,
free of the cares and worries of today… yes, the great kibble crisis is
a thing of the past when you’re living the good life… the Fibrelife!</p>
<p><strong>another parrot</strong>: Here, gathered from the four corners
of the globe, are the secret ingredients of Fibrerock… some common, some
rare… all making life easier for you and yours!</p>
<p><strong>fashion parrot</strong>: But does Fibrerock belong only in
the kitchen, the garage, the workplace? No, no, no, my darlings!</p>
<p><strong>210 fashion models on runway 210</strong>: As each girl
struts forward, she shrugs off a bulky animal fur and tosses it into a
garbage can. Underneath are all kinds of daring and tantalizing fashions
woven in the tell-tale fibre colors. The clothes are a blend of the
future and retro .</p>
<p><strong>fashion parrot</strong>: Because the clothes of the Stone Age
are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of
Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed…
by Fibre furs… Fibre frocks… Fibre foundations and Fibreshoes… it’s to
die for!</p>
<p><strong>211 fourth exhibit 211</strong>: Now, we see a display of
Fibrerock props of all kinds – appliances, toys, tools, etc… all of it
upstaged by a choir consisting of every animal, bird and critter we’ve
seen in this film. Wilma, Betty, the kids and Dino ooh and ahh with the
other guests as the mechanical animals all sing in unison –</p>
<p><strong>fibre choir</strong>: ‘It’s a Fibre World you know, It’s a
Fibre World you know, It’s a Fibre World you know –’</p>
<p><strong>212 int. barney’s workshop - night 212</strong>: Fred and
Barney are surrounded by books and cartons and memorabilia. They have
their arms around each other and are singing.</p>
<p><strong>fred &amp; barney</strong>: ‘Now it’s time to do or die, grab
that rock and kick it high, let’s fight, fight, fight for Bedrock
High!’</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Boy, those were the days, Barney. Bedrock High
winning all those games… and you and me right in the middle of it.</p>
<p><strong>213 new angle - favoring photo 213</strong>: The photograph
shows the young Fred and Barney in their cheerleading costumes. Barney
has a sweater and megaphone; Fred is in a Godzilla-like “mascot”
costume. He’s holding the hideously-sculpted head under his arm.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yeah. Too bad we never made the team.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: So what? We made the team spirit. That’s just
as important… whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You know Betty. She never throws anything
away.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Boy. Talk about memories.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big
problem. We didn’t know how good we had it. No problems, no worries…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Speaking of problems and worries, shouldn’t
we get on over to Slate’s party?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What for? So him and all his fancy friends can
look down their noses at us?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: All they’ve been doing is using us, Barney.
And meanwhile –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Meanwhile all the time they were laughing at
us.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yeah? When did you notice that?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: About an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Boy, there’s no fooling you, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>214 closer - model 214</strong>: The decomposition continues,
walls and supports turning into sand and running down before our eyes.
In a Rube Goldberg-like continuum, the little houses go first, falling
like dominoes…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wha… what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I… I don’t know… the Fibrerock it’s… it’s
decomposing… but this shouldn’t happen…</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Your old models are just fine…</p>
<p><strong>215 angle 215</strong>: Indeed, the older models from
Barney’s tinkering days are rock solid.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It should be. There’s enough coo-coo berry
resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: – The coo-coo berries! Fred, that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s it?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny?
It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: But.. why would –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable
as goldrock! And we’ve had tons of ’em delivered to the plant since we
started… somebody musta got greedy –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Not ‘somebody’ – Lava!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred, that sap acts as a fixative – it’s the
glue that holds the whole formula together – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Then… what’s happening here…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: … Is gonna happen for real in the real Slate
City!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Oh no… Barney! Wilma and Betty – and the kids
– they’re all there –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – B-barney… what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Coo-coo berry sap, Fred! It’s our only
chance – their only chance!</p>
<p><strong>217 int. slate needle - night 217</strong>: WIDEN FROM a
young kid who is drinking a glass of water and simultaneously singing
with a ventriloquist’s dummy. Obviously, the talent show has begun. In
the audience, Lava fidgets with nervous and confident energy… gives
Wilma a big look.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: You’re certainly looking lovely this evening,
Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Uh… thank you… I think.</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Yes. I think so, too. Imagine how good you’d
look with a senior executive.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Oh? Is Fred getting promoted?</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An’
sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze
mos’ fantas’tic recital in Bedrock ‘istoree. Now, I would like to sank
out mos’ generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o’vair

<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: – An’ now, what better introduction
could we ‘ave for Mrs. Slate’s vairy own gran’ nephew… Poindexter
Lava!</p>
<p><strong>poindexter</strong>: ‘Dino of Spain, I adore you Right from
the moment I saw you –’</p>
<p><strong>218 quick shots - audience 218</strong>: Their smiles become
fixed. little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their In the
wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides his head under his
paws.</p>
<p><strong>222 int. fred’s car - travelling 222</strong>: Fred and
Barney rush along, Fred at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’ll we do when we get there?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres
of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. Then we
zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope
we have enough to get everybody out – whoops!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney – ! – I can’t see straight –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Hang on, hang on –</p>
<p><strong>223 ext. car - night 223</strong>: It careens around even
more wildly now. There’s several near collisions.</p>
<p><strong>224 ext. “rockdonald’s” restaurant - night 224</strong>:
“Rockdonald’s” is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a
drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break… in
this case, Feldspar and Gravel. They’re sitting in their patrol car
eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald’s
Styrofoam.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I’m in
a rut… and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me,
they’re all big shots now: Sam Slate… Dirty Harock… Magma, P.I. And you
know why? ’Cause they got the breaks, that’s why!</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta
creature was attacking that little guy – !</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: There’s a lesson there, Gravel… never pick
up hitchhikers. Besides – – Did you say ‘creature’?</p>
<p><strong>feldspar &amp; gravel</strong>: The xenosaurus!</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: This is a xenosaurus alert. Repeat, a
xenosaurus alert. The creature has been sighted on the Slate City exit
of the Venturock Freeway! It is driving a brown late model sedan and
eating a white male Caucasian. Car twelve is in hot pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Oh, yeay… over and out!</p>
<p><strong>dispatch parakeet</strong>: Awwk! Car Twelve is on the way.
Car Twelve is on the way…</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Gravel, this could mean promotions for
both of us! Load the shotgun and turn on the siren!</p>
<p><strong>227 fred’s car - travelling 227</strong>: Barney is rocking
Fred’s head back and forth, finally gives it one last mighty yank.
Something breaks. Barney falls back on the passenger side of the car.
Fred drives with one hand, “raps” the monster head. It rattles. When
Fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in
sync.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ho, gweat! Hoo bwoke hit, Bahnee! Hi khnat
twalk hennymore!</p>
<p><strong>228 felspar’s patrol car 228</strong>: Closing in. Gravel has
produced a little sabre tooth CAT and is “cranking” its tail. As it
WAILS away, the cops close in on our heroes.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Ho noh! Ahhrisser Felghspah! Haybee whee hould
shtop – ?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: What, and explain what you’re doing in that
costume? Start talking about coo-coo berries and Fibrerock? By then
it’ll be too late!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: ’Hen yore height, yore height…</p>
<p><strong>230 slate city - rear gate 230</strong>: A fence surrounds
the empty housing development; in the distance, we can see the dark
Slate Scrapers, and past them, the brightly-lit and gleaming Fibersphere
and Slate Needle. We hear a SCREECH and then the CAMERA PANS BACK to
pickup Fred’s CAR as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground.
It crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading “SLATE
CITY–DELIVERY GATE.” The fence collapses all around the car.</p>
<p><strong>231 new angle 231</strong>: Fred and Barney stagger out of
the wreck. Barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with
relief when he finds the flit gun of coo-coo sap is still intact.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: We’d better split up; that way at least one
of us can make it to the Slate Needle – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: ‘Ood hidea. Ood whuk, ol’ bhudee.</p>
<p><strong>232 int. slate needle 232</strong>: CAMERA PANS the audience
as the accordion recital con- tinues. Several people look visibly
ill. Finally, CAMERA ADJUSTS to take in Poindexter’s big finish as he
slides forward on his knees. There’s a scattering of half-hearted
applause, led by Lava and the Slates.</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Sank you, sank you. Our nex’
performance is Bam-Bam, Pebbles… … an’ friend.</p>
<p><strong>233 pebbles, bam-bam &amp; dino 233</strong>: poised in the
stances we recognize as the “first positions” of the “Dino Dance.”
However, whereas the previous version of this was done impromptu and a
cappella with only a few primitive props and straw hats alone, this time
the kids and Dino are fully costumed, with sequins, batons and the like,
and the dance is completely choreographed.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: You can keep the twist, the frug and hop –</p>
<p><strong>234 various angles 234</strong>: As the Dino dance begins,
FULL ORCHESTRATION OVER IT. The audience seems to really like it – all
except –</p>
<p><strong>235 mrs. slate 235</strong>: who glances over at the judges
long enough to see that they like this a lot better than the accordion
act. Suddenly Mrs. Slate jumps up, barges on stage. The</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Madame Slate, what ees wrong – ?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s wrong! This ‘act’
is an absolute disgrace! This is supposed to be a talent show! And a
pedestrian animal act like this belongs in a circus!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a
circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his
–</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Yeah – a zoo where the animals are dead –
because if they aren’t, they will be!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I’ll
have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest
tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Ah… Poindexter… that’s enough …
Poindexter…?</p>
<p><strong>237 slate 237</strong>: Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava
for support, ends up pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and
looks out the window… and his jaw drops in astonishment.</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: No sign of the driver…</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: You kidding? By now he’s a couple of
shinbones and a belch.</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep these tracks
are! That xeno thing must weigh a ton!</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Okay, lizard, reach for the sky!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Offisser Fledapar, het me hexpwain – his howse
hiss maid uv fibahwock –</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Quivering quartzite, d-did you see that
–</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: O-one flick of his paw… and he knocked down
a wall – !</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Nogh, wate, chum baggk –</p>
<p><strong>241 fred 241</strong>: Tries to catch up and collides with
the already damaged house. It collapses totally, falling in on itself,
obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out
of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off
his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and
looks at the Slate Needle. He’s much closer to it now.</p>
<p><strong>242 inside the slate needle 242</strong>: Everyone is rocking
back and forth with the escalating vibrations of the swaying building.
The remaining table of refreshments slides across the room.</p>
<p><strong>243 poindexter lava 243</strong>: gets hit full force by a
flying cake shaped like Slate City. He falls on top of his accordion,
smashing it with one last dissonant squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>244 partygoers 244</strong>: They pause in their panic to
applaud gratefully.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney! The elevator – !</p>
<p><strong>246 other side of wall 246</strong>: REVEALING elevator
mechanism. The button pokes a mouse which runs out of a box. Seeing the
mouse, a nearby mastadon becomes frightened, begins running. A heavy
cable tied to the mastadon runs over a pulley and into –</p>
<p><strong>247 the elevator shaft 247</strong>: – where the elevator
rises out of the sub-level and INTO VIEW! Fred and Barny start towards
it… when suddenly the Fibrerock elevator begins to crumble!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Quick! Use your coo-coo gun – !</p>
<p><strong>248 above - fibresphere 248</strong>: Propelled upwards, the
would-be rescuers shoot OUT of the FRAME, disappear into the Fibresphere
with a CRASH!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Feldspar, if you ask me, you’ve seen too many
Rockzilla movies: In all the Xenosaurus sightings we’ve had reported,
not one has had this kind of wholesale destruction –</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Chief, you – you gotta believe me – just
one swipe of its paw and – wham – a whole house was pre-history – !</p>
<p><strong>dispatch parakeet</strong>: Calling all cars. Calling all
cars. Unconfirmed reports of destruction and collapse at Slate City.
Rescue vehicles are on the way. The xenosaurus has been spotted in the
area. That is all. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: You see – ? I told you –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: All right, Feldspar, I’m convinced! As of
this moment you’re completely in charge of operation… … ‘Xeno Dino’!
Now, what do you need?</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: Artillery.</p>
<p><strong>250 continued: 250</strong>: First to sit up is Barney, who
groans, rubs his head. Next, Fred sits up. Damn! The impact has knocked
Fred’s monster mask back on his head! Fred mutters angrily… Barney
starts to help… and then they both notice that there’s another monstrous
head in the middle of their group! There’re big “takes” all around, and
then the xenosaurus leaps out of the tangle of bodies, treads air, and
runs away!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Fred, stop it! It might know the way
inside!</p>
<p><strong>251 new angle 251</strong>: Fred and Barney both leap on the
mysterious xenosaurus – all crash through a wall –</p>
<p><strong>wilma betty</strong>: Fred? Barney?</p>
<p><strong>pebbles bam-bam</strong>: Daddy! Pop!</p>
<p><strong>fred barney</strong>: Piltdown? Pyrite?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: What the devil’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: It’s real simple, Mister Slate. Your boy Lava
here has been stealing the coo-coo berries from the Fibrerock mix and
fixing the books to hide it!</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: That’s ridiculous, Flintstone! Nobody could
get that many coo-coo berries off our premises!</p>
<p><strong>252 continued: 252</strong>: Suddenly the bottom of
Piltdown’s canvas sack rips open. Thousands and thousands of coo-coo
berries tumble out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: These sure look like coo-coo berries to me
–</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: They’re convincing fakes, Mrs. Rubble – part
of our exciting display –</p>
<p><strong>pyrite</strong>: Fakes? Gee, Pilty, I thought the real ones
were gonna be moved up here for us ta steal – whatta waste a time –</p>
<p><strong>piltdown</strong>: Pyrite, shaddup –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Now I remember! These guys were pulling this
xenosaurus act that night at the plant! What’s this, Lava… ‘Plan B’?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Uncle! Are you going to stand there while
aspersions are being cast at the Slate family? This is absurd –</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Of course it is! Why, without the coo-coo
berry sap, Fibrerock would be completely – – unstable…</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: All right, all right, I admit it! I got in
over my head in the stock market… took some big losses… I had these guys
pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster… but it still
wasn’t enough… and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered
every day, I guess I just lost my head… I figured with the Woca sap in
the Fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous…</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: I’ll tell you what’s superfluous, Lava… your
liver! So why don’t we remove it – !</p>
<p><strong>255 ext. slate needle - night 255</strong>: Rescue VEHICLES
and police CARS ROAR up, slam to a halt, CAT SIRENS WAILING. The rescue
workers jump out. Firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide
stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and
start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the
ladders.</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Come on, come on, what’s the hold up –
?</p>
<p><strong>firefighter</strong>: It’s the kibble crisis, sir – the
firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month!</p>
<p><strong>257 in the slate needle 257</strong>: Now, the remaining
LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside
spills and fire spreads.</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Fred! There’s a fire hose – !</p>
<p><strong>258 grace 258</strong>: – the star fashion model, suddenly
her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little
animal print undies.</p>
<p><strong>bam-bam</strong>: D-dad, are we gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire
department. Right, Fred?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Y-yeah. Everything’s gonna be just – Whoa,
hoo-hah, aggh –</p>
<p><strong>259 continued: 259</strong>: He’s started yelping because
he’s realized his arm is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others
begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then Fred
suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with a small flame
flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas stage magician.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: – Wait a minute – I don’t feel anything at all
–</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It must be the suit, Fred – old Bedrock High
built them things to last –</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: – Okay?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hist hust fine!</p>
<p><strong>260 in the box 260</strong>: A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up
inside, SNORING. to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is not quite a
snake: it has little vestigial forepaws the better to emote with. Right
now the snoring head is in those</p>
<p><strong>261 in the main room 261</strong>: Everyone retreats from the
fire. Slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>262 with fred 262</strong>: Waiting impatiently until the
pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. It wipes its mouth daintily with
a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back
into the other room. and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden
compart- Water shoots out of the creature’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hit fuzz nudding… wheely…</p>
<p><strong>pythonsaurus</strong>: Hey, what am I, chopped liver?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Come on, everybody – we’ll go out the way we
came!</p>
<p><strong>poindexter</strong>: Outta the way – outta the way – women
and children first – ! I mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah,
provided that uh, there’s room for the women…</p>
<p><strong>pythonsaurus</strong>: Hey, not bad. Wonder if she lives
around here.</p>
<p><strong>pythonsaurus</strong>: Heartbreaker!</p>
<p><strong>264 ext. fibresphere - long shot 264</strong>: The Slate
Needle tumbles down, taking a big chunk of the Fibresphere with it! But
the rest of the huge globe stays put… for now.</p>
<p><strong>266 up above 266</strong>: Already the first partygoers are
sliding down the elevator cable.</p>
<p><strong>headmistress</strong>: Oh, geez, we’re all gonna croak – I
neva shoulda left Far Rockaway –</p>
<p><strong>267 below 267</strong>: The rescue teams catch the people in
nets as they hit the ground.</p>
<p><strong>poindexter</strong>: Fifty clams for a piggy-back ride … a
hundred clams!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Do you see that, Jerry? Do you see how
my great-nephew is behaving at this moment of crisis?</p>
<p><strong>lava</strong>: Yeah. Real chip off the old block, ain’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Upsy-daisy, sweetheart – piggy back time!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Hohh… GWEAT!</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Go on, honey… I got Bam-Bam!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Barney… tonight you’re the biggest man in
Bedrock.</p>

I’ve ever heard!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Lhet’s dogh it!</p>
<p><strong>273 below 273</strong>: Everyone reacts in horror –</p>
<p><strong>275 closer 275</strong>: Figures on one of the islands stir:
Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam… Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims
the flit gun – empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It’s all they can
do.</p>
<p><strong>278 wilma and betty 278</strong>: Suddenly become
inspired.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: W-wilma… those hoops of bamboo… those wires…
do you think – ?</p>
<p><strong>wilma</strong>: Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try it – ! Dino!
Dino, look down here – !</p>
<p><strong>279 dino 279</strong>: Obeys, puzzled –</p>
<p><strong>wilma and betty</strong>: You can keep the twist, the frug
and hop I don’t need to shimmy, I don’t need to bop –</p>
<p><strong>281 big camera push - dino 281</strong>: MUSIC COMES UP
DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges
toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends.</p>
<p><strong>283 long shot 283</strong>: – Dino slides down the long wire,
carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net
as Wilma and Betty wind up!</p>
<p><strong>wilma and betty</strong>: Yes, I don’t need to shimmy, I
don’t need to bop ‘Cause I’m doin’, doin’, doin’</p>
<p><strong>284 fred 284</strong>: rolls out of the net and away from the
others. He’s slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up… suddenly
lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees –</p>
<p><strong>feldspar</strong>: It’s the xenosaurus – stand back, men –
it’s a vicious killer – Ready – Aim –</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: High ham noght a zenosore! High ham hay hooman
beeng – !</p>
<p><strong>286 close - fred 286</strong>: Momentarily safe, he tries
desperately to remove that stupid head – bangs it against the wall,
tears at it with his claws – – meanwhile, the chunk of Fibrerock
protecting him decomposes! He’s back in the line of fire!</p>
<p><strong>288 wider 288</strong>: Pause.</p>
<p><strong>288 continued: 288</strong>: Then Officer Gravel takes a good
look at that rear end.</p>
<p><strong>gravel</strong>: Hey, those are the biggest shorts I’ve ever
seen… … It… it must be Mister Flintstone! Cease fire! Gee, Sarge, now
you don’t have to shoot him – !</p>
<p><strong>289 the flintstones and rubbles - dawn 289</strong>: Safe,
they all emotionally embrace. Fred even suffers Dino’s affection.
Piltdown, Pyrite and Lava drives past. Poindexter Lava</p>
<p><strong>poindexter</strong>: Dad! Dad! Can I use the Porscherock
while you’re in the slammer?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Flintstone. Rubble. I… I don’t know what to
say. I… I treated you horribly… I ignored you, abused you… and then you
come here and risk your necks like this… well, there’s no price you can
put on something like that, so I won’t even try. But let me give you… …
a hearty handshake.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: Dear, don’t you think a little more than
that is in order?</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Honey, you’re being hysterical, go lie down,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slate</strong>: I am not being hysterical, I am being
fair – now the Flintsteins and Rabbles saved all of our lives, not to
mention your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Okay, okay. Boys, I’m feeling guilty about
how you’ve been taken advantage of, so I’ll tell you what… I’m going to
give you back all world-wide rights to Fibrerock, free and clear.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Your only obligation will be to cover oh,
whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You think there’s gonna be some?</p>
<p><strong>290 his pov - the ruins and destruction 290</strong>: Smoking
desolation as far as the eye and CAMERA can see. As we watch the last
remaining fragment of Slate City collapse, crushing a police car.</p>
<p><strong>slate</strong>: Oh, you never know…</p>
<p><strong>292 rescue dinos 292</strong>: Several sniff at the air, look
curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled Fibrerock. One and then another
shuffles over, tentatively tastes some… grins… and digs in! Seeing this,
the “firesauruses” crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the
pile of Fibrerock crumbs.</p>
<p><strong>293 fred, barney, slate and others 293</strong>: All turn at
the growing sound of the ANIMALS PIGGING OUT.</p>
<p><strong>293 continued: 293</strong>: Now DINO “YI-YI-YI’S” past this
group and leaps into the pile, munching like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barn…? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Lava Lava leaves… Woca sap… all still there,
but now the nutrients are all released… … Fred, this… this is Dino
kibble!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dino kibble…?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Dhinough khibble!!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Barney, we – we’re rich! Yabba dabba do –
!</p>
<p><strong>294 slate 294</strong>: Faints dead away! The CAMERA PULLS
BACK… BACK…</p>
<p><strong>296 continued: 296</strong>: A pretty carhop on stone roller
skates glides over. Fred holds up one finger towards her. She nods,
scampers O.S. Fred rubs his hands and licks his lips with antici-
pation… and then the girl returns with a massive rack of ribs on a car
tray. She hooks it on the edge of the driver’s door… and the entire car
tips over with a crash.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: We’ll have a yabba dabba-do time A dabba-do
time We’ll have a gay old time!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wilma…? … Wilma?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wilma? Wil-ma –!</p>
