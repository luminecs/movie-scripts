<p><strong>the army of darkness</strong>: Screenplay by Sam Raimi and
Ivan Raimi January 3, 1991 Registered with the Writers Guild of America,
1991 c 1991 by Sam and Ivan Raimi. All rights reserved. Shooting Script
2/26/91 ——————————————————————————</p>
<p><strong>1 grainy black and white - close-up - a man’s desperate face
1</strong>: This is Ash, mid twenties, square jaw firmly set and a pair
of haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear. Ash speaks to the
CAMERA with urgency:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Why would you say that I am insane? I wouldn’t
say that I’ve lost my mind simply because I’ve heard the voices and seen
the godless things moving in the woods. If anything, I think more
clearly now than ever before. I know now that there is such a thing as a
living Evil. A dark and shapeless thing that lives not in the spaces we
know, but between them. In the Dark. In the night. And it wants the
exact same thing as you and I: a chance at warm life on this Earth. It
doesn’t care that is already had that chance …once. Now listen closely
because there isn’t much time. Listen and believe, because it’s all
true.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. a log cabin - night 2</strong>: nestled in a dark
forest. Through the window, we see the tiny figure of Ash picking up a
book from a desk.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I first saw the damn thing at that blasted
cabin. The Necronomicon. An ancient Sumarrian text, bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood. It contained bizarre burial rites,
prophesies…and instruction for demon resurrection. It was never meant
for the world of the living.</p>
<p><strong>3 int. cabin - night 3</strong>: Ash flips through the pages
from the BOOK OF THE DEAD.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: The book awoke something dark in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>4 book of the dead - camera panning strange script
4</strong>: inscribed on the pages. Illustrations of demonic faces with
white eyes.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. woods - night 5</strong>: We take the point of view of
a wind-like demon, swooping low through the woods toward the cabin.
CAMERA rips through the cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: It got into my hand and it went bad.</p>
<p><strong>6 close on ash’s possessed hand 6</strong>: twisting into a
claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: So I lopped it off at the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. cabin - night 7</strong>: ASH severs his hand from his
wrist with the chainsaw.</p>
<p><strong>8 blood red clouds 8</strong>: sweep past the moon.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: In order to rid myself of the foul thing, I
read from a passage in the book that was supposed to open a hole. A hole
in Time that would send the Evil back. And it worked.</p>
<p><strong>9 a bandaged, one handed ash 9</strong>: recites the
incantation from the Necronomicon.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. cabin - night 10</strong>: The Time vortex is
created. Trees and a 1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile are sucked up into the
funnel cloud.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: …I just didn’t plan on coming along.</p>
<p><strong>11 ext. cabin - night 11</strong>: Ash, now armed with
shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the funnel-cloud of the Time
vortex.</p>
<p><strong>12 int. time vortex 12</strong>: Ash is rocketing through a
funnel of swirling clouds. He is swept away from us, hand over foot,
through the dark void of Time.</p>
<p><strong>13 animation - a tendril of smoke 13</strong>: swirls through
blackness as a chorus of women’s voices build to eerie crescendo, from a
musical note to a SCREAM. The smoke swirls, pulls in upon itself, like a
thing alive, and forms the words:</p>
<p><strong>“bruce campbell”</strong>: “Vs” The smoke is wisked away,
then reforms as…</p>
<p><strong>“the army of darkness”</strong>: The title billows past
CAMERA REVEALING…</p>
<p><strong>a grandfather clock</strong>: its hands winding backwards at
an insane rate, spins angrily past, revealing other debris that has been
swept up into this funnel cloud. Tumbling weightless through this void
we find…</p>
<p><strong>15 ash 15</strong>: He SCREAMS but there is no sound. No
scream. Only the steady BEATING of his heart.</p>
<p><strong>16 angle on ash front screen projection 16</strong>: He
shields his eyes from a sudden bright light. The funnel cloud
electrifies.</p>
<p><strong>17 ash’s body 17</strong>: RIPS at the fabric of Time.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. cloudy sky - day 18</strong>: All is quiet. Then, an
electrical disturbance in the shape of a human body flashes briefly and
is gone. A moment latter, Ash appears and tumbles from the sky, falling
past CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. barren wasteland - day 19</strong>: ASH falls to the
dust. His double barrelled shotgun lands beside him. The ’73 Oldsmobile
comes CRASHING to the ground a moment later.</p>
<p><strong>20 ash 20</strong>: looks up from the dust to behold…</p>
<p><strong>21 twenty-five mounted horsemen 21</strong>: in 12th century
armor ride up over a hill. They halt before Ash.</p>
<p><strong>22 warrior #1 22</strong>: thrusts his longsword into the
air, shouting:</p>
<p><strong>warrior #1</strong>: Hail to him who has come from the sky to
deliver us from the terror of the Deadites! Hail!</p>
<p><strong>23 ash 23</strong>: stares in confusion at the strange
medieval figures.</p>
<p><strong>24 twenty-five warrior 24</strong>: join in the chant and
hail Ash, but suddenly stop as…</p>
<p><strong>25 arthur 25</strong>: the muscular commander of the group,
gallops his horse into frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his
lieutenants. Arthur lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.</p>
<p><strong>26 arthur’s p.o.v. 26</strong>: The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The
chainsaw, strapped to Ash’s back. The handless stump of Ash’s right arm.
The Shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>27 a frightened ash 27</strong>: waves a shaky hand.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Take is easy now chief. I don’t know how I got
here and I’m not lookin’ for any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>28 wiseman john 28</strong>: An elderly man, in a long black
cloak, steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: My Lord Arthur, I believe he is the
promised one, written of in the Necronomicon.</p>
<p><strong>29 arthur 29</strong>: Brings his sword down across Ash’s
chest. Ash cries out in pain as…</p>
<p><strong>30 ash’s chest 30</strong>: is cut. A thin red gash.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: He bleeds. As a man bleeds. The one written
of in the Book would not bleed.</p>
<p><strong>31 arthur gestures 31</strong>: and CAMERA PANS to four
prisoners bound in iron shackles.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Likely, he is one of Henry’s men. I say to
the pit with him! If he is truly the promised one… he will emerge.</p>
<p><strong>warrior #2 and #3</strong>: Aye! The pit’s a fair test!</p>
<p><strong>gold toothed warrior</strong>: To the pit with the
blackard!</p>
<p><strong>32 gold tooth 32</strong>: charges his horse at Ash. But he
is met with the wooden stock of Ash’s shotgun as it swings into frame,
cracking against his jaw.</p>
<p><strong>33 wide shot - gold tooth - stuntman 33</strong>: He tumbles
from the horse.</p>
<p><strong>34 ash 34</strong>: leaps atop Gold Tooth’s horse and jerks
the reigns.</p>
<p><strong>35 long shot - ash’s horse 35</strong>: rears up, kicking
it’s hooves into the air.</p>
<p><strong>36 ash 36</strong>: gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him.
Ash kicks him in the face as he gallops past. The Warrior is sent
reeling.</p>
<p><strong>37 trucking shot - ash 37</strong>: galloping over a hill. He
is almost thrown by the horse, but manages to hang on for dear life.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Where the hell they put the stirrups on this
thing!!??</p>
<p><strong>38 close shot - ash’s feet 38</strong>: grasping at the side
of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.</p>
<p><strong>39 long shot - ash - stuntman 39</strong>: he rides past
CAMERA, almost falling from the horse.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: LIEUTENANTS! Fetch me the blackard.</p>
<p><strong>41 two of arthur’s armored horsemen 41</strong>: unsheathe
their broadswords and gallop after Ash. The remaining Warriors watch for
sport.</p>
<p><strong>42 high shot - two horsemen 42</strong>: They are gaining an
Ash.</p>
<p><strong>43 ash 43</strong>: glances behind him.</p>
<p><strong>44 ash’s p.o.v. - trucking shot - two horsemen in pursuit
44</strong>: They diverge to either side of CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>45 ash 45</strong>: whips his horse.</p>
<p><strong>46 the first horseman 46</strong>: rides up alongside Ash and
swings his Broadsword.</p>
<p><strong>47 ash 47</strong>: ducks the blade.</p>
<p><strong>48 the second horseman 48</strong>: rides up alongside Ash’s
other flank. He swings and lands the flat part of his blade along Ash’s
back.</p>
<p><strong>49 ash 49</strong>: ducks as the first horseman swings his
blade again.</p>
<p><strong>whoosh!</strong>: ASH looks left…</p>
<p><strong>50 the second horseman 50</strong>: winds up for another
blow.</p>
<p><strong>51 ash 51</strong>: yanks back upon his horse’s reigns.</p>
<p><strong>52 the three horses 52</strong>: running side by side. Ash’s
horse drops back suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>53 the second horseman 53</strong>: swings.</p>
<p><strong>54 his broadsword 54</strong>: slams the First Horseman
across the face.</p>
<p><strong>55 the first horseman 55</strong>: is knocked from his
steed.</p>
<p><strong>56 trucking shot - the first horseman 56</strong>: is moving
fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles end over end in
the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.</p>
<p><strong>57 the second horseman 57</strong>: turns around and gallops
back toward Ash.</p>
<p><strong>58 wide shot - ash and the second horseman 58</strong>: ride
at one another.</p>
<p><strong>59 trucking shot - the second swordman as he rides
59</strong>: swinging his Broadsword.</p>
<p><strong>60 trucking shot - ash as he rides 60</strong>: He inserts
the stump of his right arm into the female end of his chainsaw arm
bracket. FOOMP! He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
place. CLINK! He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the
starter cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT… The engine won’t turn over. He curses and
yanks again.</p>
<p><strong>61 the second horseman 61</strong>: draws close. He leans
from his horse and swings his Broadsword mightily. The flat portion of
the blade connects. THUNK!</p>
<p><strong>62 ash 62</strong>: is knocked from his steed. He tumbles to
the dust, narrowly escaping his own horse’s hooves.</p>
<p><strong>63 ash 63</strong>: rolls to his feet and spins to the sound
of approaching hooves!</p>
<p><strong>64 the second horseman 64</strong>: charges and swings his
broadsword.</p>
<p><strong>65 ash 65</strong>: raises his chainsaw. CLINK! He deflects
the blow. Ash swings</p>
<p><strong>66 trucking shot - the second horseman 66</strong>: is
knocked from his horse.</p>
<p><strong>67 low trucking shot - the second horseman 67</strong>:
bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.</p>
<p><strong>68 a sword handle 68</strong>: slams against the back of
Ash’s skull.</p>
<p><strong>69 ash 69</strong>: crumples. He looks up in pain to…</p>
<p><strong>70 arthur 70</strong>: above him. The sun over his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>71 eight mounted warriors 71</strong>: gallop up, dismount
and surround Ash with swords drawn.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Bring the prisoner! The warriors surge upon
Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw are taken from him.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>72 gold tooth and other warriors 72</strong>: secure Ash to a
set of iron shackles that painfully extend his arms. A collar forces his
neck upward.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: To the castle!</p>
<p><strong>73 warrior #2 on horseback 73</strong>: prods Ash along with
a rod attached to his spiked iron collar. The Warriors gallop off,
forcing Ash and the other prisoners to run alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>74 wiseman john 74</strong>: Picks up the chainsaw and sawed
off shotgun from the dust. He is troubled by the strange objects.
Sunlight glints off the blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>75 the hot orb of the sun 75</strong>: blazing in the sky
above the wasteland.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. parched land - day - a weary ash 76</strong>: bound
in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides alongside
him.</p>
<p><strong>gold tooth</strong>: Move along now!</p>
<p><strong>77 longshot - a wind swept landscape of craggy rock
77</strong>: CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to
find a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff. A
drawbridge is lowered. Arthur’s warriors ride over it.</p>
<p><strong>78 camera tracking with ash 78</strong>: shackled alongside
other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle walls.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: a striking, blonde haired maiden, rushes
into frame. She searches the faces of Arthur’s warriors and grows
concerned. She pushes through a crowd of villagers and calls up to
Arthur atop his horse.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: M’Lord Arthur! Where is my brother? Did he
not ride with you?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Eye. And fought valiantly. But last night
fell in battle to Duke Henry’s men.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Her face does not immediately register the
grief. She attempts to step forward but stumbles. She steadies herself
against the stone wall. Her eyes harden as she sees the first of the
shackled prisoners: a semi-conscious Ash. She flushes with anger and
races up to him. She spits and kicks at him as he’s dragged along.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Foul thing! A pox on your throat! Thou art a
Murderer! A black Murderer!</p>
<p><strong>80 village women 80</strong>: restrain her.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: cries as the Village Women attempt to soothe
her.</p>
<p><strong>village woman #1</strong>: May you be consoled by their
suffering in the pit.</p>
<p><strong>81 the procession, ash and the four other prisoners
81</strong>: halt. Iron keys rattle. The shackles are unlocked. Ash and
the prisoners rub their reddened wrists. They are pushed at swordpoint
towards a circular iron grate that sits atop the ground. This is THE
PIT.</p>
<p><strong>82 ash 82</strong>: looks to the jeering villagers that
surround the pit, wondering what they have in store for him.</p>
<p><strong>83 sheila 83</strong>: stares at him in hatred.</p>
<p><strong>84 the prisoner next to ash 84</strong>: eyes Ash curiously.
This is Duke Henry the Red.</p>
<p><strong>duke henry</strong>: You sir, are not one of my vassals. Who
are you?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>duke henry</strong>: I am Henry the Red. Duke of Shale. Lord
of the Northlands and leader of its people.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: You ain’t leadin’ but two things now, pal. Jack
and shit. And Jack left town.</p>
<p><strong>85 a stern faced arthur and his four lieutenants 85</strong>:
address the doomed men:</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: There is an Evil that has awakened in this
land. And whilst my people fight for their very souls against it, you,
Duke Henry the Red, wage war on us. Your people are no better than the
foul corruption that lies in the bowels of that pit! May God have mercy
on your souls.</p>
<p><strong>86 two of arthur’s men 86</strong>: crank a massive wench.
Chains tighten and the heavy iron lid slides back, revealing a dark
hole. The Pit.</p>
<p><strong>87 from the bowels of the iron grated pit 87</strong>: a
echoed wailing rises up.</p>
<p><strong>88 ash, henry and the other prisoners 88</strong>: stiffen in
fear.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Aye. Into the pit with the bloodthirsty
sons of whores! She jams a meat pie into her mouth and cheers excitedly
as</p>
<p><strong>90 henry’s warrior #1 90</strong>: as he’s thrown down into
the pit. He disappears into the blackness.</p>
<p><strong>91 camera pans and halts close on ash 91</strong>: watching
with disbelief. We hear the warrior’s echoed cry of terror, then a
SPLASH as he hits bottom.</p>
<p><strong>92 close on the edge of the pit 92</strong>: looking down
into the blackness we hear:</p>
<p><strong>henry’s warrior #1</strong>: I beg of you… by all that’s
holy! Lower a rope! Lower… Oh, for the love of god! no! NO!!!
AIIIIIiiieee! The sound of ripping and scratching. The SHRIEK of terror
is cut short as…</p>
<p><strong>a geyser of blood</strong>: erupts upward from the pit. Then
silence.</p>
<p><strong>93 ash 93</strong>: is frozen in fear.</p>
<p><strong>tower guard</strong>: There! He’s escaping!</p>
<p><strong>ash’s terrified gaze</strong>: jerks from the pit to…</p>
<p><strong>94 tracking shot - henry’s warrior #2 94</strong>: making a
break for it! He’s past the guards, heading for the open drawbridge.</p>
<p><strong>95 the tower archers 95</strong>: spot him and fire
arrows.</p>
<p><strong>ping! ping!</strong>: They bounce off the Warrior’s armor.
He’s makes it to the open drawbridge when…</p>
<p><strong>97 arthur 97</strong>: pulls back a iron arrow in his
crossbow. ZING! He lets it fly. CAMERA SWISH PANS with arrow…</p>
<p><strong>98 pan halts on henry’s warrior #2 98</strong>: The iron
arrow punctures the Warrior’s armor, pegging him to a wooden post. He
dies standing.</p>
<p><strong>99 the crowd 99</strong>: Cheers. They turn their attention
to the remaining prisoners: CAMERA PANS from their bloodthirsty faces to
the next prisoner in line…</p>
<p><strong>100 ash 100</strong>: turns to Arthur and in a desperate,
cowardly plea:</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Hey, I never even saw these assholes before..
He spins to Duke Henry the Red. You gotta tell ’em you don’t know me. We
never met. Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I do not believe that he shall listen.</p>
<p><strong>101 the warriors 101</strong>: grab Ash and shove him into
the pit.</p>
<p><strong>102 ash 102</strong>: tumbles down into the pit. He lands in
a STEAMING pool of foul water at the pit’s bottom. He stands and coughs
out a mouthful</p>
<p><strong>103 int. pit - ash’s p.o.v. 103</strong>: UNDERGROUND CAVERNS
disappear into the blackness.</p>
<p><strong>104 ash 104</strong>: spins to a small sound.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. pit - ash’s p.o.v. 105</strong>: Nothing. Just the
mist rising from the water.</p>
<p><strong>106 ash 106</strong>: shifts his glance again.</p>
<p><strong>107 a shadow 107</strong>: rounds a corner and disappears
from sight.</p>
<p><strong>108 ash 108</strong>: doesn’t notice the misty water behind
him beginning to stir. Bubbles. A hand emerges. Silently, a pair of bone
white eyes break the surface.</p>
<p><strong>109 ash 109</strong>: spins… but there’s nothing there. As he
turns back around, he is confronted by…</p>
<p><strong>a female evil dead</strong>: It’s rotted corpse rockets up
from the water inches from Ash’s face!</p>
<p><strong>110 closer 110</strong>: Putrid water drains from it’s empty
eye sockets and mouth. It jerks like a marionette as it advances.</p>
<p><strong>111 ash scream 111</strong>: and backs against the steep rock
wall of the pit. He tries to scale the steep face. He gets one foot
up.</p>

<p><strong>120 ash 120</strong>: cries out in pain.</p>
<p><strong>121 ash’s legs 121</strong>: cross to form a scissor lock

<p><strong>126 above the pit - wiseman john 126</strong>: shouts down at
Ash.</p>
<p><strong>127 the pit - ash 127</strong>: trying to hear what the
Wiseman is saying. His head jolts backward, barely avoiding the beast’s
wild swing. Ash squints to discern Wiseman John throwing something down
to him: an object falling at him through the glare above.</p>
<p><strong>128 the chainsaw - slow motion 128</strong>: tumbling
downward. Blinding beams of sunlight bouncing off its blade of steel.
Ash’s Excalibur!</p>
<p><strong>129 ash - slow motion 129</strong>: summons his strength and
leaps upward.</p>

his chainsaw arm, yanking the starter cord and…</p>
<p><strong>135 above the pit - the warrior and villagers 135</strong>:

pit.</p>
<p><strong>136 the pit - low angle - the deadite 136</strong>: lunges at
Ash.</p>
<p><strong>137 deadite hand meets saw 137</strong>: Buzzzzz!!</p>
<p><strong>138 ash 138</strong>: is splattered with black bile.</p>
<p><strong>139 the deadite’s severed hand 139</strong>: flies upward,
past the face of the bewildered beast.</p>
<p><strong>140 camera mounted to the hand 140</strong>: as it ascends,
Ash and the Deadite grow smaller below.</p>
<p><strong>141 above the pit - the deadite’s severed hand 141</strong>:
flies up into frame and latches onto the face of a drunken spectator.
It’s fingers dig into the eyes and nose. He shrieks and flails about,
into the screaming crowd. A Warrior tears the hand free from his face,
tossing it back down into the pit.</p>
<p><strong>142 the pit - ash 142</strong>: raises the chainsaw blade and
neatly bisects the falling deadite hand. He spins and with a roundhouse
blow…</p>
<p><strong>143 camera mounted on ash 143</strong>: Ash decapitates the
beast.</p>
<p><strong>144 above the pit - the warriors and villagers 144</strong>:

the murky waters of the pit.</p>
<p><strong>146 ash 146</strong>: climbs the steep wall of the pit when a
SECOND DEADITE emerges from the earthen wall before him.</p>
<p><strong>147 ash 147</strong>: slams the butt end of the chainsaw into
the beast, knocking it back into the water.</p>
<p><strong>148 above the pit - the villagers 148</strong>: gasp as…</p>
<p><strong>149 ash’s chainsaw arm 149</strong>: comes up, over the edge
of the pit. Followed by… THUMP! Ash’s bloody hand. Then his bruised
face. Covered in the black blood of the Deadites. He crawls to his feet.
Ash tuns to the crowd, his list clenched.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: All right now. Who wants to be next? Who wants
some.</p>
<p><strong>150 gold tooth 150</strong>: look at Ash stupidly. Ash shoves
him.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: You want some more? Huh?! Gold Tooth and the
others give him a wide berth. Ash calls out to Henry.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Now climb on those horses and get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>151 henry and his two warriors 151</strong>: quickly mount
horses.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Nay. Henry is my prisoners. He–</p>

<p><strong>154 henry and his warriors 154</strong>: to gallop off toward
the open drawbridge and freedom.</p>
<p><strong>155 arthur 155</strong>: stares at Ash with hatred.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: For that, I shall see you dead.</p>
<p><strong>156 ash 156</strong>: removes his sawed off shotgun from
Wiseman John’s horse and turns to Arthur, then the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: This is my boomstick. It’s a twelve gauge,
double barreled Remington pump. Next one of you primitives touch me…</p>
<p><strong>157 ash spins, 157</strong>: pointing the barrel just past
Arthur. He, but no one else, has spotted the surviving Second Deadite
crawling up from the pit on the forgotten chain. The crowds gasp is cut
short by….BLAMMITY-BLAM! The shotgun belches flame. The blast cuts the
chain, leaving the Deadite teetering at the pit’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>blammity-blam!</strong>: The second shot blows the beast into
a backflip, sending it summersaulting down into the pit.</p>
<p><strong>159 the sound of the gunblast 159</strong>: echoes off the
mountains like distant thunder.</p>
<p><strong>160 sheila, the wiseman, arthur and the crowd 160</strong>:
look to Ash in reverence.</p>
<p><strong>161 ash 161</strong>: twirls the shotgun about western style:
WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH… and holsters it.</p>

<p><strong>163 something moves in the darkness 163</strong>: It prowls,
skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly past rocks and over
the crest of a hill revealing…</p>
<p><strong>164 ext. temple ruins - long shot - night 164</strong>: A
massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each twenty feet
tall. The remains of an ancient temple. In the center of the ruins there
burns a roaring bonfire. As old Woman stirs a cauldron atop the flames.
Nearby, Arthur converses with his four Lieutenants.</p>
<p><strong>close up - ash</strong>: opens his mouth to allow a spoonful
of food to enter. No sooner has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is
offered. He waves it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from
a goblet on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.</p>
<p><strong>166 ash and sheila 166</strong>: sits across the flames from
Arthur and his men. She bandages Ash’s wounds.</p>
<p><strong>167 sheila 167</strong>: is dresses in a revealing tunic. She
looks good.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I pray thee to forgive me. I believed thee
one of Henry’s men. She touches Ash’s hand. Ash turns away</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: First you wanta kill me, now ya wanna kiss me.
He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Lady, just leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I’m sorry m’lord. Please understand… T’is a
cruel time for us. The Wisemen say you are the promised one. Our only
hope against the darkness that has descended on this land.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: They’re mistaken. She stares deeply into his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I think not. I feel that there is reason for
your being here. It is no accident.</p>
<p><strong>166 wiseman john and two other cloaked wisemen 167</strong>:
approach. They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from Ash.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Well what is it? Can you send me back or
not?</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Only the Necronomicon has the power. A
power which we both require. It contains passages that can dispel the
Evil from this place and return you to your time.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: The Necronomicon. Yeah, that’s the thing that
got me here.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: It is in a place far from here. It can
only be retrieved by the Promised one. Other Warriors have tried. Their
widows grieve still. We have waited long years for you. Out only hope is
the Necronomicon. Thou must undertake to quest for it. Alone must thou
travel to a distant cemetery. There thou shalt find it.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Me? Now way, no day. Only place I’m goin’ is
home. A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.</p>
<p><strong>169 dogs 169</strong>: around the fire begin to snarl and
fight.</p>
<p><strong>170 ash and sheila 170</strong>: turn to see…</p>
<p><strong>171 the old woman 171</strong>: now standing too close to the
fire. Her robes ignites. She does not respond as flames sweep up her
body. She continues to stir the caldron.</p>
<p><strong>172 ash 172</strong>: His haw drops. He slowly stands as…</p>
<p><strong>173 the burning woman 173</strong>: spins sharply to him. Her
voice changes as she SHRIEKS;</p>
<p><strong>you shall die!</strong>: Her eyes are bone white. She is
POSSESSED by the dark spirit. Her burning body is violently jerked about
in the air by invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild
animal snarl. With two voice at once;</p>
<p><strong>174 the possessed woman 174</strong>: collapses. Her face
turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in the dust.</p>
<p><strong>175 close on possessed woman’s face - ground level camera
175</strong>: Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open! A nasty
grin forms on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen

<p><strong>176 wiseman john 176</strong>: kneels and reaches for
her.</p>
<p><strong>177 ash’s hand 177</strong>: clutches Wiseman John, not
allowing him to touch her.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: It’s a trick. Get an axe.</p>
<p><strong>178 the possessed woman 178</strong>: awakens from her false
slumber with a terrible BARK. In a frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into
the bonfire. He SCREAMS and rolls in the dust, extinguishing the
flames.</p>
<p><strong>179 paper mache stone archway 179</strong>: With her great
strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one of the giant stone
archways. It topples over, crushing two warriors beneath it.</p>
<p><strong>180 a gigantic stone 180</strong>: topples the next
stone.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: Which topples the next, which sets off a
chain reaction.</p>
<p><strong>boom! boom!</strong>: Like giant dominoes, they fall.</p>
<p><strong>181 ash 181</strong>: watches the spectacle in horror as he
sees…</p>
<p><strong>182 angle on 182</strong>: The gigantic falling stones coming
right at SHEILA!</p>
<p><strong>183 the falling stone’s p.o.v. - sheila 183</strong>: She

ground.</p>

into the path of…</p>
<p><strong>191 angle on 191</strong>: The falling, gigantic domino-like
stones.</p>
<p><strong>the possesses woman</strong>: SHRIEKS in agony as… SMASH! The
multi-ton stone crushes her legs to paste. Her legs are pinned but still
she battles on, clutching Ash about his throat!</p>
<p><strong>193 ash 193</strong>: gasps for breath as he reaches behind
him, into the flames of the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>194 possessed woman - stop motion animation 194</strong>: Her
blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an impossibly large
size, like a snake about to eat an egg.</p>
<p><strong>195 ash 195</strong>: grasps a flaming log with his bare
hands and rams it down the monster’s oversized throat. She chokes.</p>
<p><strong>196 gold tooth and three other warriors 196</strong>: grab
the beast and pull it off of Ash. Arthur comes to meet them. He carries
a double-bladed battle axe.</p>
<p><strong>197 the possessed woman 197</strong>: vomits out the flaming
log, taking off a man’s head.</p>
<p><strong>possessed woman</strong>: The Evil lives. Slay me and ten
will rise to take my place. All will die. ALL WILL -</p>
<p><strong>198 in silhouette, the axe 198</strong>: is brought down upon
her throat. The possessed body flails and spasm beneath the Warrior’s
grip.</p>
<p><strong>199 the head 199</strong>: rolls, and comes to a halt at
Ash’s feet. It’s eyes pop open!</p>
<p><strong>200 arthur 200</strong>: grabs the laughing head and tosses
it into the darkness. The head sails away as the laughter receded.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Now. Will thou quest for the
Necronomicon?</p>
<p><strong>201 close on ash 201</strong>: He considers.</p>
<p><strong>202 int. castle - blacksmith’s workshop - day 202</strong>:
Ash and the blacksmith step into the shop.</p>
<p><strong>203 ash 203</strong>: points to the hand piece on a hanging

modifying it.</p>
<p><strong>205 sheila 205</strong>: knits a grey woolen garment as she
watches Ash.</p>

wound spring.</p>
<p><strong>209 sheila 209</strong>: gasps.</p>
<p><strong>210 ash’s spring-driven iron hand 210</strong>: SNAPS open
with great force.</p>
<p><strong>ash’s spring driven hand</strong>: clenches closed with such
great power, that it bends a iron goblet.</p>
<p><strong>212 close on ash 212</strong>: He studies his new hand. It
will do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: stares over the castle wall to the foreboding
wasteland with apprehension. The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila
appears behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around her.
Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one another and
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>214 ext. landscape of cracked ground 1500mm lens - day

Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur’s Warriors. CAMERA PULLS
BACK TO REVEAL…</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia
of Arthur’s army that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand. His
chainsaw juts from it’s saddle holster on the horse’s back. Ash’s cape
billows as he rides.</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. mountain - day 216</strong>: The Horsemen wind down
a trail. Suddenly the horses rear up. The men gain control of the
frightened steeds.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: points to…</p>
<p><strong>217 the trail that lies before them 217</strong>: It
disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits an eerie
whistling.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: This is the edge of the land ruled by
the Dark Spirit. This path will lead you to an unholy place. A cemetery.
There, the Necronomicon awaits.</p>
<p><strong>218 ash 218</strong>: anxiously eyes the wall of swirling
mist.</p>
<p><strong>219 the two warriors 219</strong>: finish placing saddlebags
of water and food onto…</p>
<p><strong>ash’s horse</strong>: which nervously pounds the earth with
it’s hooves.</p>
<p><strong>warrior #1</strong>: Lord Arthur, he is supplied. Now I beg
of you, let us leave this foul place.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: A moment.</p>
<p><strong>220 wiseman john 220</strong>: moves close to Ash.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: As thou removest the Book from it’s
cradle, you must recite these words. Clatoo, verata, Nicto.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Clatto Verata Nicto. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Repeat them.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Clatto Verata Nicto.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman #1</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I got it. I got it. I know your damn words. All
right? Now you get this straight: I get the book, you send me back.
That’s the deal. After that I’m history. Ash rears up on his horse and
gallops into the mist</p>
<p><strong>221 arthur and wiseman john 221</strong>: watch as Ash
disappears.</p>
<p><strong>222 in a sea of mist 222</strong>: The sound of THUNDEROUS
HOOFS. A form materializes out of the fog: It is Ash.</p>
<p><strong>223 closer on ash 223</strong>: He whips the horse.</p>
<p><strong>224 angle on ash 224</strong>: He gallops past. CAMERA PANS
as he disappears into the thick fog.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself
on a trail leading into a thick forest.</p>
<p><strong>long shot - ash</strong>: rides slowly on through the
darkening woods.</p>
<p><strong>227 closer on ash 227</strong>: He hears a sound and look
to…</p>
<p><strong>228 a section of woods 228</strong>: A branch SCRAPING
against the bark of a tree.</p>
<p><strong>229 ash 229</strong>: hears a woman’s soft laughter. He
glance to…</p>
<p><strong>230 a bubbling brook 230</strong>: and nothing more.</p>

<p><strong>233 the evil force 233</strong>: sweeps over the forest
floor, gaining velocity.</p>
<p><strong>234 ash 234</strong>: frantically weaves his horse around
storm felled trees which jut from the ground.</p>
<p><strong>235 the evil force 235</strong>: rips through the trees,
splintering them to toothpicks. It burrows underground, and resurfaces,
always closing upon Ash.</p>
<p><strong>236 ash 236</strong>: jerks upon the reins and his steed
leaps a fallen tree. He gracefully leaps a second tree. But as he leaps
over the third, he is ripped off the horse by a low branch. He falls
hard to the mud as the horse gallops off. He groggily stands and
stumbles onward.</p>
<p><strong>237 the evil force 237</strong>: follows Ash down a wooded
trail.</p>
<p><strong>238 ash 238</strong>: running for…</p>
<p><strong>239 ext. wooden shed 239</strong>: a grain storage house in
the clearing ahead.</p>
<p><strong>240 ash 240</strong>: comes upon the shed’s door. Locked. He
heaves his body against it but it won’t give.</p>
<p><strong>241 int. shed - close on interior door 241</strong>: A log,
that serves as the door’s bolt, holds fast.</p>

ridge.</p>
<p><strong>243 ash 243</strong>: unscrews his iron hand and holsters it.
He slings the chainsaw from his shoulder and snaps it onto his stump
bracket. Click. He threads the chainsaw starter cord through the
V-SHAPED SLOT that extends from his breastplate. CLICK. He thrusts out
his arm and the chainsaw ROARS to life!</p>
<p><strong>244 int. shed - close on interior door 244</strong>: The
blade bites into the log that bolts the door.</p>
<p><strong>245 the evil force 245</strong>: draws closer.</p>
<p><strong>close on chainsaw blade</strong>: halfway through the log.
Sawdust flies.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Come on! Come on! The chainsaw dies. He jerks
out his arm to restart it. Putt. Putt.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Blasted piece of junk!</p>
<p><strong>248 the evil force 248</strong>: draws closer.</p>
<p><strong>249 ash 249</strong>: delivers a mighty kick to the door.</p>
<p><strong>angle on door</strong>: The partially cut log gives way. Ash
tumbles into the storage shed. He slams the door shut and slides the
remainder of the log across the latch, re-bolting it.</p>
<p><strong>251 the evil force 251</strong>: Hammers at the door of the
Shed.</p>
<p><strong>252 int. shed 252</strong>: A terrified Ash braces his back
against the door.</p>
<p><strong>bang!</strong>: Earth shaking in its intensity. The planks of
the door shudder behind Ash.</p>
<p><strong>253 close on log bolt 253</strong>: It cracks.</p>
<p><strong>254 ash 254</strong>: presses himself against the door for
all he’s worth, praying that whatever it out there, won’t get in. BANG!
Splinters fly.</p>
<p><strong>255 close on log bolt 255</strong>: BOOM! The crack
widens.</p>
<p><strong>256 the door frame 256</strong>: behind Ash begins to buckle
beneath the hammering blows.</p>
<p><strong>257 ash 257</strong>: begins to SCREAM. And the BANGING
halts.</p>
<p><strong>258 long shot - int. shed 258</strong>: All is quiet. Ash
hugs the door. Shaking in the silence. And that’s when it hits. LIKE A
LOCOMOTIVE! Ash and the door he braces are blasted away from the wall of
the Shed as the Evil Force brings it’s tremendous power to bare.</p>
<p><strong>tracking with ash and the door</strong>: as they are swept up
at super speed in the grip of the Evil Force. Ash is seen rocketing
through the long hallway of the Shed, spinning head over heels. Ash rips
through other doors, taking them with him. Ash is now sandwiched between
two doors as he flies through the air.</p>
<p><strong>260 ext. shed - side shot 260</strong>: The roof of the shed
ripples, sending tiles and wood beams flying as the EVIL FORCE surges
through the shed like a tidal wave.</p>
<p><strong>261 ext. rear door of shed 261</strong>: It blows out from
the place in a flying stack along with the other doors. The flying doors
slam against a tree and fall to the ground in a stack.</p>
<p><strong>262 the evil force 262</strong>: with Ash out of sight,
glides forward, into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>looking down upon - the stacks of doors.</strong>: All is
quiet. We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob turns slightly.
The door swings upward and opens… revealing a somewhat flattened Ash who
picks his groggy and bruised self up.</p>
<p><strong>264 ext. abandoned mill 264</strong>: An empty place of stone
and wood. Driven by the wind, the Mill’s giant grinding wheel slowly
turns with a squeak.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: enters the Mill.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Anybody here?! The place is quiet. Ash slumps
down against a wall to catch his breath.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: This place’ll do for the night. Get the book in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>266 int. mill - three shots - intervolometer 266</strong>:
Shadows lengthen on the floor and stretch across the walls.</p>
<p><strong>267 ash 267</strong>: peers through the window.</p>
<p><strong>268 ext. mill - long shot the sun - day 268</strong>: a
gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill. The wind kicks up.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: listens as the cabin CREAKS like an old ship
beneath the force of the gale.</p>
<p><strong>270 the wooden shutters 270</strong>: on the window quietly
KNOCK. Ash shivers and rubs his arms for warmth.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Damn this cold.</p>
<p><strong>271 ash 271</strong>: looks about the Mill and spots an iron
stove.</p>
<p><strong>272 gasoline 272</strong>: pours out of Ash’s chainsaw over
some logs in the stove’s belly.</p>
<p><strong>273 ash 273</strong>: lights the fire with his Zippo lighter
and huddles near the flame for warmth.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: ’least I won’t freeze to death. He turns to a
tiny sound.</p>
<p><strong>274 wide shot - ash 274</strong>: behind him, through the
window, a large gnarled hand sweeps past.</p>
<p><strong>275 ash 275</strong>: spins, raises his shotgun and
fires.</p>
<p><strong>blamity-blam!</strong>: The window is ripped away in a shower
of glass.</p>
<p><strong>276 ash’s p.o.v. - through the broken window 276</strong>:
Only the night woods. The “gnarled hand” comes back, sweeping down in
front of the broken window, but it’s revealed to be just a tree branch
swaying in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>277 ash 277</strong>: reloads. He moves to the front door and
peers out through a crack.</p>
<p><strong>278 ash’s eyeball 278</strong>: through the crack in the
door.</p>
<p><strong>279 ash’s p.o.v. - the woods beyond 279</strong>: CAMERA
pushes through the crack to the woods beyond. There is movement.</p>
<p><strong>280 long shot - ext. mill 280</strong>: The tiny figure of
Ash steps from the Mill.</p>
<p><strong>281 close up - ash 281</strong>: He sweeps the barrel of the
shotgun toward the sound of sticks breaking.</p>
<p><strong>282 ash’s terrified horse 282</strong>: It rears up on it’s
hind legs. It’s front hoofs come down toward Ash.</p>
<p><strong>283 a startled ash 283</strong>: leaps aside just in
time.</p>
<p><strong>284 ash 284</strong>: snags the horse’s reigns.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Easy, boy. The horse calms. Ash ties it to a
tree, patting it’s head. A shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the
Mill.</p>
<p><strong>285 ash’s p.o.v. through the mill’s open door 285</strong>:
He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the
front door of the Mill, halting Ash’s view. Ash races for the Mill.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: races through the door and toward CAMERA
when…SMASH…Ash’s reflection shatters. He’s run into a mirror. Shivering,
he picks himself up from the pile of broken glass. He moves to the
fireplace and hunches before the flames, CAMERA PANS TO….</p>
<p><strong>288 the shattered mirror pieces 288</strong>: Each piece of
mirror reflects an image of Ash. From the eight pieces of mirror
spring…</p>
<p><strong>289 eight tiny ashes 289</strong>: Two inch high versions of
himself. They leap from the mirror fragments and land on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>290 ash 290</strong>: is unaware of them as he kneels close
to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>291 tiny ash #1, #2, and #3 291</strong>: grab a discarded
dinner fork. Like men on a battering ram, they race forward to jam it
into Ash’s buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>292 ash 292</strong>: SCREAMS in agony and jerks forward,
banging his head into the stove pipe.</p>
<p><strong>293 tiny ash #4, #5, and #6 293</strong>: lift the barrel of
the shotgun in Ash’s direction. Another leaps upon the shotgun’s
trigger. BOOM!</p>
<p><strong>294 ash 294</strong>: barely dives away from the blast the
would have taken his head off.</p>
<p><strong>295 the tiny ashes 295</strong>: SHRIEK with uncontrollable
laughter. They jump away from the shotgun and scurry off across the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>296 ash 296</strong>: pulls the fork from his buttocks and
heaves it.</p>
<p><strong>297 tiny ash #1 297</strong>: is running for his life, as
fast as his tiny legs will carry him.</p>
<p><strong>298 tracking shot - the fork 298</strong>: a giant projectile
as it ROARS AT CAMERA. PAN with it as it WHOOSHES past.</p>
<p><strong>299 the fork 299</strong>: skewers tiny Ash #1 to the wooden
wall of the mill.</p>
<p><strong>300 ash 300</strong>: stumbles over a broom handle that has
been thrust out in front of him by other tiny ASHES. His head slams into
a stove pipe. He crumples. He lands with his cheek pressed against the
hot stove. SSSSSSssss. He pries his face loose with a spatula.</p>
<p><strong>301 a bucket of grease 301</strong>: is pushed off a high
shelf.</p>
<p><strong>302 it lands on ash’s head 302</strong>: and spills slippery
grease about the floor.</p>
<p><strong>303 ash 303</strong>: with an upside-down bucket on his head,
slips and falls, back and forth on the grease. He stands and tries to
dislodge the bucket. He trips over the broom handle, again thrust in his
path. He falls backward, onto a crochet basket with knitting needles
jutting from it.</p>
<p><strong>304 bucket-headed ash 304</strong>: SCREAMS and jerks upward,
slamming his bucket head into the stove pipe. CLANG! Ash rips the bucket
from his head then yanks the needles from his buttocks. He looks about
for the little imps.</p>
<p><strong>305 tiny ash #2 305</strong>: crouching behind a log
attempting to hide. BUT…</p>
<p><strong>306 ash 306</strong>: has seen him. He “accidentally” elbows
the log and Tiny Ash #2 into the stove’s fire.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Ooops.</p>
<p><strong>307 tiny ash #2 307</strong>: is burned alive.</p>
<p><strong>308 ash 308</strong>: glances downward at the pitter patter
sound of tiny feet.</p>
<p><strong>309 tiny ash #3 309</strong>: is dashing across the open
expanse of floor. Ash’s gigantic foot comes down to crush the little
man. Tiny Ash #3 raises a rusty nail into the path of the descending
foot.</p>
<p><strong>310 the nail rips 310</strong>: through Ash’s shoe.</p>
<p><strong>311 ash 311</strong>: jerks his leg upward in pain. Ash
dances about the place hopping on one foot, HOWLING. He strays into the
greasy area of the floor and stumbles over the broomstick again thrust
in his path, swung there by Tiny ASHES #6, #7 and #8. He almost regains
his balance when he strays into the oil patch, falls, and hits his head
on the stone floor. BLACKNESS.</p>
<p><strong>312 ash 312</strong>: awakens on the floor of the Mill, like
Gulliver he is bound with tiny ropes. Directly above him, on the edge of
a table…</p>
<p><strong>313 tiny ashes #4 and #5 313</strong>: suspend Tiny Ash #6 by
his legs.</p>
<p><strong>314 tiny ash #7 and #8 314</strong>: stand atop Ash’s face.
They push from either side of his nostrils, plugging his nose. Ash’s
mouth opens as he gasps for air. As he inhales…</p>
<p><strong>315 suspended tiny ash #6 315</strong>: is released.</p>
<p><strong>316 tiny ash #6 - slow motion - wind fan 316</strong>: He
free falls for a moment, then the tiny body arcing to form a perfect
swam dive, plunges down into Ash’s opened throat.</p>
<p><strong>317 ash 317</strong>: inhales the living beast whole. He
chokes violently. He breaks his bonds an he hacks for breath. He puts
his finger down his throat, trying to make himself vomit up the little
man, to no avail. He looks about to crush some of the little ASHES but
they are gone. He places his hand on his stomach and dizzily stumbles to
a chair. He goes pale.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Nasty little thing’s inside me. He stands
indignant but double over in sudden pain. Well let’s see how you like a
little hot water! He grabs the hot kettle from the stove and pours the
scalding contents painfully down his throat. He sets down the kettle and
waits for a moment. A tiny SCREAM emits from Ash’s stomach</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: emits a bark of LAUGHTER. He clutches as his
chest. Then his arm. He rips back his shirt sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>318 close on ash’s arm - stop motion animation 318</strong>:
We can see the outline of Tiny Ash #6’s body squirming down Ash’s arm,
just beneath the skin.</p>
<p><strong>319 ash 319</strong>: watches in horror as…</p>
<p><strong>320 the tiny figure 320</strong>: squirms down his wrist and
disappears into his iron hand. The Iron hand snaps open and closes
uncontrollably. The possessed iron hand swings at him.</p>
<p><strong>321 the iron hand 321</strong>: connects with an uppercut
that knocks Ash out of frame.</p>
<p><strong>322 ash 322</strong>: lands next to an iron vice. He reaches
for the EVIL HAND. But the hand has grabbed a mallet that BONK-BONKS him
on the head. Ash is groggy as he is grabbed by the hair and yanked down
into the opened vice.</p>
<p><strong>323 the evil iron hand 323</strong>: cranks the vice’s
handle.</p>
<p><strong>324 the vice 324</strong>: tightens around Ash’s head.
Trapped, he looks to…</p>
<p><strong>325 the evil hand 325</strong>: rummaging through a wooden
toolbox. It comes upon a crude wooden punch.</p>
<p><strong>326 angle - the evil hand - undercranked 326</strong>: stabs
rapidly at Ash’s good hand. But Ash expertly dodges each stab with an
opening of the fingers or a closing of the thumb is super fast
motion.</p>
<p><strong>327 ash 327</strong>: with is head still wedged in the
vice.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Why you dirty little…AHHHHHH!!</p>
<p><strong>328 a pair of iron pliers 328</strong>: has entered frame and
clamps down upon Ash’s nose. He emits a nasal SCREAM and shakes the
pliers loose.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Soon as I get out of this thing</p>
<p><strong>the pair of iron pliers</strong>: dip into Ash’s mouth and
clamps down upon a back molar.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No! Not the teeth!</p>
<p><strong>329 the evil hand 329</strong>: jerks his rear MOLAR from his
head and holds up the tooth for his inspection. It sets the tooth down
nearly in front of him. The Evil hand forms a fist and crushes the tooth
to dust. It scurries from view.</p>
<p><strong>330 ash’s head 330</strong>: struggling in the grip of the
vice.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Where the hell are ya!?</p>
<p><strong>331 the evil hand 331</strong>: grabs a red hot fireplace
poker from the fire.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I can’t see ya!!</p>
<p><strong>his evil hand</strong>: raises a red hot fireplace poker and
presses it against the right half of his body.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No, no–not the poke– SSSSsssssssss!</p>
<p><strong>332 ash 332</strong>: jerks his head free from the vice with
a SCREAM. He holds up his iron hand. It’s back to normal. Again under
his control.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Okay then. But he halts abruptly as he feels a
strange sensation: His shoulder itches. He scratches it. The Itch grows.
It itches madly. He rips back his shirt. Upon his shoulder… THERE</p>
<p><strong>333 the camera races into this hideous sight 333</strong>: It
is the eyeball of EVIL ASH. Beneath it, a mouth and nose begin to take
shape on the surface of Ash’s back.</p>
<p><strong>334 ash 334</strong>: SHRIEKS and SHRIEKS and races out of
the mill. The CAMERA follows him in docu-horror style as he flees into
the dark woods.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs
and through the</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Dear God, it’s growing bigger!</p>
<p><strong>336 the protrusion swells and grows larger. 336</strong>:
It’s taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from his
shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil incarnate.
He is now a man with two heads!</p>
<p><strong>337 two headed ash 337</strong>: Staggers through the woods
like a drunkard, the two identical heads trading insults, and sharply
butting against one another.</p>
<p><strong>338 the bad ash head 338</strong>: opens it’s mouth and bites
the nose of the Good Ash head.</p>
<p><strong>339 the good ash head 339</strong>: retaliates by gouging the
eyes of the Bad Ash head.</p>
<p><strong>340 two headed ash 340</strong>: collapses against a tree.
Under the light of the full moon we see a terrifying sight:</p>
<p><strong>341 two additional arms 341</strong>: sprout from Ash’s
body!</p>
<p><strong>342 a leg 342</strong>: rips out of his stomach. Another foot
POPS out from his back.</p>
<p><strong>343 two headed ash 343</strong>: Like a human spider he
scurries about the forest floor, propelled by his four arms and four
legs. Suddenly he stands and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away
from the first. He literally splits into two.</p>
<p><strong>344 split screen - wide shot 344</strong>: When it’s over,
there are two ASHES. GOOD ASH and…</p>
<p><strong>345 bad ash. 345</strong>: They square off beneath the
moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>346 high shot as the two ashes 346</strong>: circle one
another like wolves.</p>
<p><strong>good ash</strong>: What… are you? Are you me?</p>
<p><strong>bad ash</strong>: WHAT… ARE GOO? ARE GOO ME?!! You sound like
a jerk!</p>
<p><strong>good ash</strong>: Why are you doing this?!</p>
<p><strong>bad ash</strong>: Wanna know? ’cause the answers easy. It’s
cause I’m the bad Ash, and yer…</p>
<p><strong>347 evil ash 347</strong>: Dances a funny jig around Ash. He
SMACKS Ash across the face as he sings:</p>
<p><strong>evil ash</strong>: …Little goody two-</p>
<p><strong>smack!</strong>: …shoes, little goody two-</p>
<p><strong>smack!</strong>: …shoes, little good–</p>
<p><strong>348 evil ash 348</strong>: the shotgun barrel is suddenly
shoved into his frame, pointing at his nose.</p>

feet.</p>

backwards into a double backflip.</p>

shotgun.</p>

<p><strong>352 long shot - ash 352</strong>: staring down at the body of
his evil self.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I know better than to bury you whole.</p>
<p><strong>353 ext. mill wheel - long shot - night 353</strong>: The
giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes of
lightning. The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body of his Evil
Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill. The giant blades of
the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-</p>
<p><strong>354 montage sequence: 354</strong>: Ash’s hand light a
torch.</p>
<p><strong>355 frightened bats fly 355</strong>: from the base of the
windmill.</p>
<p><strong>356 chains are pulled tight 356</strong>: across the body of
Evil Ash to secure it.</p>
<p><strong>357 the chainsaw 357</strong>: is switched on. It spews a
plume of blue exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>358 ash 358</strong>: falters for a moment as he stares down
at the form of his Evil twin. He grits his teeth… and lowers the saw to
the grisly task.</p>
<p><strong>359 ext. night sky - blood red clouds 359</strong>: float
past the moon. We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag
from the Mill. Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the
base of an old Oak Tree in the graveyard. Ash mumbles nervously to the
bloodies burlap bag at his feet as he digs a grave.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Now you see what’s what. Man’s body is his own
personal property. Don’t anybody try to take that away from him.</p>
<p><strong>361 ash 361</strong>: finishes digging and lifts the bloody
burlap sack. As he heaves the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head
spills out.</p>

burial marker high above his head;</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Rest in pieces.</p>
<p><strong>366 ash 366</strong>: backlit by the moon, brings the burial
maker swiftly into the grave. A flash of lightning reveals…</p>
<p><strong>367 the graveyard 367</strong>: in the distance. A burial
place of evil. The old mill wheel GROANS in the gale.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: This must be it. The cemetery.</p>

wind. He looks to…</p>

BOOK OF THE DEAD.</p>
<p><strong>379 a baffled ash 379</strong>: steps close.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Wait. Three books? Nobody said anything about
that. Ha! That Wiseman was so busy fillin’ me fulla his secret words and
phrases and, and, his… bullshit, he forgot to mention anything about
that. Like do I take all of ’em of one or ’em, or what? Well… He reaches
for the first book and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>whoooooosh!!!</strong>: To reveal a black hole. SCREAMS ERUPT
from the dark abyss of the Book. It begins to suck things into it.</p>

like jello until it finally snaps back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Woah. Wrong book. He turns to study…</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: tries to decide between them. At first he’s
sure which one it is. Then, chiding himself for being so easily duped,
chooses the other.</p>
<p><strong>389 the book 389</strong>: moves ever so slightly as he
reaches for it.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Huh. Ash reaches for it again and the book
bites him!</p>
<p><strong>390 the book of the dead - puppet 390</strong>: Rodent teeth

becomes airborne, flying right at CAMERA like a bat!</p>

Swooping erratically around Ash’s head.</p>
<p><strong>392 the batbook 392</strong>: shrieking, chases Ash around,

<p><strong>393 ash 393</strong>: pulls it from his face and throws it.
It lands back on it’s pedestal.</p>
<p><strong>394 ash 394</strong>: faces the remaining book. He slowly

over.</p>
<p><strong>395 close on book 395</strong>: It’s cover is bound in the
dried skin of a man’s face! Two empty eye sockets stare out from it.
This is the Book of the Dead…</p>

<p><strong>ash</strong>: Okay. The words. Say the words. KLATOO!…
VERATA… uh… Uh… Necta… uh… Nectar… Necktie… uh… He hesitates, then calls
out boldly.</p>
<p><strong>klatoo… verata…</strong>: NECTtphhhhhhhhhh… He deliberately
muffles the last word that he can’t remember. The wind stops. It seems
to have worked. He looks about with growing confidence.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Okay then. But he loses his smile as… a LOW
RUMBLE is heard on the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: A tiny figure among the gravestones which
tremble and one by one are thrust from the earth.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Hey, wait a minute. Everything’s cool! I said
the words! I did!</p>
<p><strong>398 ext. castle - night 398</strong>: A violent storm in the
distance. Lightning flashes.</p>
<p><strong>a door</strong>: blows open revealing Wiseman John. He looks

<p><strong>408 the skeletal hands 408</strong>: toss Ash to…</p>
<p><strong>409 the rotted arms 409</strong>: grab Ash’s head and bang it
on a rock. Two of the six arms try to shake and slap some sense into
him. A rotted fist is waved at him. Another rotted arm backhands him.
The arms thrust his face toward the skeleton hands.</p>
<p><strong>410 the skeleton hands 410</strong>: curl boney fingers,
clenching them into fists.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No.. no more… The skeletal fists pepper Ash’s

<p><strong>ash</strong>: Leave me alone! Leave me aHUUU!</p>
<p><strong>411 the skeletal fingers 411</strong>: last out and snag
Ash’s tongue between their boney pincers, shutting Ash up. With his

him, shutting him up. Both hands work double-time at slapping him.</p>

He stamps on one of the skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Keep you damn filthy bones outta my mouth.
SNAP! He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea of
limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the Book of the
Dead but Ash scoops it up first. He leaps over another set of groping
arms that rip from the ground!</p>

danger but still he rides hard.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I’m through bein’ their garbage boy. I did my

the book!</p>

<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: The Necronomicon. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>433 ash 433</strong>: pours a bucket of water over his head
and begins drinking.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Did you bring the Necronomicon!</p>
<p><strong>434 ash 434</strong>: slurps down more of the water, averting
his eyes from the Wiseman.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Yes. It’s just that…</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Just what?!</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Nothing. Here Ash produces the Necronomicon.
Now send be back. Like in the deal.</p>
<p><strong>435 wiseman john 435</strong>: takes the book and suddenly
goes pale.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: No…I sensed something had gone awry.
The book’s power. It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>436 the crowd 436</strong>: murmurs at this bad news.</p>
<p><strong>437 ash 437</strong>: suddenly looks very guilty. Wiseman
John turns to him.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: When you removed the Necronomicon from
it’s cradle, did you speak the words?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Yeah. basically.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Did you speak the exact words?!</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Well, maybe not every single syllable, no. But
basically I said them. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>438 wiseman john 439</strong>: bows his head, stung by this
information.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: Dung eating fool! Thou hast doomed us.
When thou misspoke the words the Army of the Dead was awoke.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Hey. We had a deal. You told me, you could
clean this thing up, once I got you the book. You said there was a
passage in there that could get rid of this thing and send me back.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: The passage is useless to us as long
as these evil dead walk. They have a terrible desire for this book. And
they shall come here to get it. Once in their possession, the Evil shall
rule the Earth for one thousand years…Because of you…we are doomed.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: You wanted the damn book. You got yer book. I
did my part of the deal.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: We did strike a bargain. I will return
you to your own time as promised.</p>

<p><strong>441 ash 441</strong>: sees Sheila, but looks away, consumed
with the guilt that he’s doomed her.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: The Wisemen were fools to believe that you
were the Promised one. That one such as you could have saved us!.</p>
<p><strong>442 ash 442</strong>: is solemn.</p>
<p><strong>443 arthur 443</strong>: and the others turn away in
contempt.</p>
<p><strong>444 sheila 444</strong>: moves closer.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I still believe that thou wilt help us.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: No.. They’re right. I screwed up. I didn’t come
through for you, and… I’m sorry for it.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I still have faith in thee. In my heart I
know thou wilt still succeed.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Sheila… It’s over for me. I don’t belong here
and I’m going home. I didn’t have what it took. It’s over. He bows his
head and moves off. A high pitched SHRIEK is heard!</p>

soars over Ash. No longer aerodynamically sound, it crashes to the

the beast, pegging it to a tree. The bone white eyes of the creature
darken.</p>

woman’s SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>458 sheila 458</strong>: in the clutches of WINGED DEADITE
#2.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: M’Lord Ash! Help me! The beast flies off

the wilderness and come this way.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How far from here?</p>
<p><strong>scout</strong>: But two days ride.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Then these winged ones are only the first of
them.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman</strong>: Perhaps we should go from this place while
we can.</p>
<p><strong>gold tooth</strong>: We could be safe in the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>warriors</strong>: Yes! To the mountains! We must flee!
They’ll take our souls!</p>

forward.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: How will we stop an army of the dead at out
castle walls? How will you fight that?! With more words? Most of out
people have already fled. We are but forty men.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: We’ll get Henry the Red and his men to fight
with us.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: We shall not stand in battle, alongside the
likes of him. Our honor will not allow it.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Then you’ll die. Honor and all. Now who’s with
me?</p>
<p><strong>464 the crowd 464</strong>: is silent as they consider Ash’s
words. Then from the rear, the Village Blacksmith steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>blacksmith</strong>: I’ll stand by you.</p>
<p><strong>465 a warrior 465</strong>: steps forward. Then another.</p>

your help. Fight with us.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: So you are a vassal of Arthur now? You have
taken up sides with him against me.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: The only side I’m takin’ is the one that’s
gonna stop those things. Henry laughs.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why should I endanger my people to save my
enemy?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Because after they finish with Arthur they’ll
come after you. Together, we’ve got a chance. Besides, you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>evil ash and sheila</strong>: ride side by side on skeletal

Tooth from the craft.</p>

ladder away. A sword comes up into frame, stabbing Arthur. He is yanked
to his death with a shriek! Evil Ash, with his bloody sword, leaps up
from the ladder and onto the parapet. He’s headed for the Book of the
Dead.</p>
<p><strong>586 below in the courtyard - ash 586</strong>: races to a set
of ropes and pulley that ascend the parapet. Two deadites come at him.
He grabs the rope with his steel hand and slices one end of it with his
sword.</p>
<p><strong>587 above him - a net of boulders 587</strong>: plummet down
atop the two deadites, crushing them. Simultaneously, Ash is tanked
upward by the rope, to the parapet.</p>
<p><strong>588 ash 588</strong>: looks to…</p>
<p><strong>589 evil ash 589</strong>: approaching the Necronomicon.</p>
<p><strong>590 ash 590</strong>: kicks aside a hay bale and removes a
mini-crossbow with four flame tipped arrows, loaded and ready. He
fires.</p>
<p><strong>591 a flame arrow 591</strong>: imbeds in Evil Ash’s leg and
ignites his body. Another flaming dart hits his shoulder blade. The
flames consume his body. He burns and SHRIEKS!</p>
<p><strong>592 ash 592</strong>: watches in horror as…</p>
<p><strong>593 the flames receed 593</strong>: revealing a bone white
skeleton with mismatched eyes. SKELETAL EVIL ASH! It races at Ash with a
SHRIEK.</p>
<p><strong>594 ash and evil ash 594</strong>: bring their swords
together with such great force that sparks fly. Ash is forced back
against the stone pedestal that holds the Necronomicon.</p>
<p><strong>clang!</strong>: With a deft stroke, Ash’s sword is flung
from his hand.</p>
<p><strong>595 ash’s sword 595</strong>: imbeds in a wooden beam.</p>
<p><strong>596 evil ash 596</strong>: grabs the Necronomicon, then
swings his sword at Ash.</p>
<p><strong>597 ash 597</strong>: grabs a burning iron torch from its
mount.</p>
<p><strong>whoosh! klang! whoosh! klang!</strong>: Man and Skeleton
battle with flaming torch and sword.</p>
<p><strong>klang!</strong>: The torch is knocked from Ash’s hand. It
falls over the edge of the wall and lands in the courtyard below. It
ignites a fuse. The burning fuse leads to a sack of black powder. The
sack sits upon the spoon of a catapult.</p>
<p><strong>skeleton ash</strong>: swings his sword. Ash leaps over the
blade. The Skeleton swings downward, and Ash side steps it.</p>
<p><strong>601 ash 601</strong>: rabbit punches CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>602 close on skeleton head 602</strong>: Ash’s fist bursts
out all it’s rotted teeth.</p>
<p><strong>603 ash 603</strong>: delivers a right hook, spinning the
skeleton’s head around in a circle.</p>
<p><strong>604 the skeleton 604</strong>: gives Ash a backwards
roundhouse kick to the face. Ash tumbles over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>605 ash 605</strong>: falls to the courtyard below, alongside
the catapult. He glances at the burning fuse.</p>
<p><strong>606 evil ash 606</strong>: leaps from the parapet and lands
atop the catapult. The Skeleton looks down at Ash with a nasty grin of
bone.</p>
<p><strong>607 skeleton ash 607</strong>: Behold… He gestures to the
Evil Dead that overrun the parapet and now battle the last twenty of
Arthur’s warriors for control of the Keep.</p>
<p><strong>skeleton ash</strong>: You’re finished. He extends the
Necronomicon to taunt Ash.</p>
<p><strong>skeleton ash</strong>: I possess the Necronomicon. I’ve
crushed your pathetic army. Now I’ll have my vengeance! He raises his
sword for the death blow…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Duke Henry’s men! They’ve come!</p>
<p><strong>610 ash and the skeleton 610</strong>: turn… A jubilant CHEER
rises from the castle as…</p>
<p><strong>611 duke henry the red and fifty of his men 611</strong>:
thunder down the hill, across the drawbridge and into the castle
courtyard to attack the Deadites!</p>
<p><strong>612 the skeleton - atop the catapult 612</strong>: turns back
to Ash and raises his sword for the kill.</p>
<p><strong>613 ash 613</strong>: has grabbed a sword from a fallen
warrior. With a single motion he slices the hand that holds the
Necronomicon from Skeleton Ash.</p>
<p><strong>614 ash 614</strong>: snags the book with one hand and on the
backswing, slices through the rope, springing the catapult.</p>
<p><strong>615 the skeleton and burning satchel 615</strong>: are flung
over the castle wall.</p>
<p><strong>the skeleton projectile</strong>: rockets up past camera,
waving its boney arms. The burning satchel follows. BOOM! The skeleton
is blown to bits in mid air. A CHEER goes up within the castle courtyard
as Henry’s Warriors crush the last of the Deadites.</p>
<p><strong>617 glorious beams of morning sunlight 617</strong>: streak
over the horizon. Ash enters frame. He holds the Necronomicon as he
looks wearily out over the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>618 long shot - the battlefield - morning 618</strong>:
Smoking skeletons lay scattered. Henry and Arthur’s Warriors work
together. They toss the deadite bones and armor into a bonfire.</p>
<p><strong>619 close shot - two deadite skulls 619</strong>: engulfed by
flames, crack in the heat.</p>
<p><strong>620 ext. seashore - arrowheads - dusk 620</strong>: are
dipped into the flame of a bonfire. They ignite.</p>
<p><strong>621 the integrated army of henry and arthur’s men
621</strong>: Form a row of archers. They fire their flaming arrows
toward the sea.</p>
<p><strong>622 the arrows 622</strong>: strike a wooden ship that holds
the body of Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: We said goodbye to Arthur. Sure we had our
problems. But in the end, he was all right.</p>
<p><strong>ash and the others</strong>: watch the funeral pyre sail off.
It’s flickering flames play upon their faces.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Peace was made between the two peoples. And a
new nation was formed. They offered my a chance to stay among them and
teach them. A chance to lead them. To be King. But Sheila was gone.
Besides, I had places to go.</p>
<p><strong>625 the wisemen 625</strong>: mix a vat of liquid over a fire
as they recite a passage from</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: hands the flask of liquid to Ash.</p>
<p><strong>wiseman john</strong>: The Book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep a century. Swallow six drops, and thou shalt
awaken in thine own time.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Yeah. Right… Ash takes the flask and studies
it. …but what other choice did I have?</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: rides off.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I had to find a place to crash. For a very long
time.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: with the aid of his horse, drags the
Deathcoaster inside the cave. He sets the horse free.</p>
<p><strong>yahh!!</strong>: It gallops off.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Places a black powder charge at the mouth of
the cave. He ignites the fuse and climbs into the car.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I locked the door.</p>
<p><strong>boom!</strong>: The powder charge blows. The cave’s entrance
is sealed shut with an avalanche of rock.</p>
<p><strong>630 int. cave - deathcoaster 630</strong>: The car headlights
come on, piercing the blackness.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: uncorks the flask filled with the Wiseman’s
brew.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I closed my eyes. He lets six drops fall into
his mouth. One for each century he must sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I took a drink. Ash is unaware that an extra
drop has fallen into his mouth! A 7th drop! Ash swallows the liquid.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: I didn’t know if it was day or night. I
started… to get drowsy… And I slept…</p>
<p><strong>632 ash 632</strong>: falls into a deep slumber.</p>
<p><strong>633 the deathcoaster’s headlights 633</strong>: fade.</p>
<p><strong>634 closer on ash’s sleeping face 634</strong>: now in a
different position. Time has passed. He needs a shave.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: …And dreamed.</p>
<p><strong>635 the hands on ash’s wristwatch 635</strong>: wind faster
and faster, then halt and rust in time lapse photography. The leather
band rots away and the watch falls from Ash’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>636 the sun 636</strong>: rises then sets.</p>
<p><strong>637 the moon 637</strong>: follows.</p>
<p><strong>638 a crack 638</strong>: forms along the surface of the
aging rock wall.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: Dreams last lasted centuries.</p>
<p><strong>639 a barren tree 639</strong>: sprouts buds, they swell
forming leaves which change to the brilliant colors of fall then
drop.</p>
<p><strong>640 a frost 640</strong>: covers Ash.</p>
<p><strong>641 icicles 641</strong>: on the ceiling of the cave melt.
The water drops down onto Ash’s face. He stirs.</p>
<p><strong>642 ash 642</strong>: awakens in a heap of rusted scrap,
which was once the Deathcoaster. His clothes and armor having
deteriorated, he is buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the
cave. He digs at the rocks that block the cave’s entrance. Sunlight
streams into the hole he has created.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: climbs from the cave and steps into the
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: And when I awoke…</p>
<p><strong>644 ash 644</strong>: beholds…</p>
<p><strong>645 a futuristic city - 645</strong>: after the next Nuclear
war: a dead land.</p>
<p><strong>a fractured clock tower</strong>: lays sprawled on its side.
The time of mankind’s death frozen on the cracked face of the clock.</p>
<p><strong>647 a shattered bridge 647</strong>: abruptly ends, a third
of the way across a river it once spanned. Upon it, rest heaps of
futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs piled eight deep in some places. CAMERA
PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash, amidst the atomized pieces of iron and
bone.</p>
<p><strong>ash</strong>: ….I found that I had slept too long.</p>
<p><strong>648 ash 648</strong>: is so small a dot now, and so far away,
that we almost can’t hear his terrified SCREAM!</p>
