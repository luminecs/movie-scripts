<p><strong>american madness</strong>: Written by Robert Riskin</p>
<p><strong>4. int. of bank - closeup</strong>: Of a cover being yanked
off an adding machine.</p>
<p><strong>5. close shot at switchboard</strong>: A telephone operator,
busily plugging in wires.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Good morning . . . Union National Bank . .
. Just a minute�</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Of the inside of a massive vault door, made
impressive by the shining, finely cut steel bolts and the many other
intricate-looking instruments which adorn it.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Come on, come on, Oscar, what are we waiting
for?</p>
<p><strong>2nd teller</strong>: What’s the matter? Can’t you find
it?</p>
<p><strong>3rd teller</strong>: Sneak up on it, boy!</p>
<p><strong>4th teller</strong>: Oscar, come on!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Say, if it had lipstick on it, he’d find
it!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Almonds to you! Almonds!</p>
<p><strong>tellers</strong>: Now, now, Oscar - not almonds!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nine o’clock and all is lousy!</p>
<p><strong>1st teller</strong>: Yes, I spend half of my life waiting for
these time clocks to open. Say, where’s Matt?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Probably upstairs thinking up that daily
joke.</p>
<p><strong>2nd teller</strong>: That guy kills me with his
wisecracks.</p>
<p><strong>3rd teller</strong>: Say, when he comes in, let’s put on a
frozen face. Let’s not smile.</p>
<p><strong>1st teller</strong>: Shhh! Nix! Here he comes�</p>
<p><strong>7. med. shot</strong>: CAMERA PICKS UP Matt Brown, the chief
teller, as he strides briskly in and begins turning the combination dial
to the main vault. He is about twenty-six, a clean-looking, personable
youngster. Several of the tellers are standing close to him, looking
on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How are you doing slaves?</p>
<p><strong>tellers</strong>: Hello, Matt. How’re you Matt?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Say, did you boys ever hear the story of the
pawnbroker with the glass eye?</p>
<p><strong>1st teller</strong>: No Matt, what is the story about the
pawnbroker with the glass eye?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. A fellow went into this
shop to pawn his watch. The pawnbroker said, “I’ll give you $50 for it,
if you can tell me which is my glass eye.” The fellow said, “All right,
I’ll do that. It’s the right one.” The pawnbroker said, “That’s correct.
But how did you know it was the right one?” The fellow</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sympathy! You know, the right one had more
sympathy than the other one!</p>
<p><strong>1st teller</strong>: What’s the matter? Can’t you get this
thing open?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Six reasons why banks fail!</p>
<p><strong>tellers</strong>: I love your jokes, Matt! They’re so
entertaining! A very funny man!</p>
<p><strong>8. med. shot</strong>: Matt opens the inside door, made up of
perpendicular steel bars. The tellers scurry into the cavernous-looking
interior. Someone snaps on a light. CAMERA TRUCKS</p>
<p><strong>up to vault.</strong>: The back walls of the vault are lined
with steel cabinets divided into many small compartments. On one side is
a wall safe which is also opened by a combination and which contains the
surplus cash carried by the bank. Matt is in charge of this. All around
the room are numerous hand trucks - one for every teller. These trucks
contain the cash in the charge of the individual tellers. While the
tellers in the b.g. obtain their keys and open the drawers of their
trucks, Matt examines the time clock which is attached to the inside of
the vault door.</p>
<p><strong>9. int. vault - med. close shot</strong>: At the door, as
Matt enters and goes directly to the burglar alarm box to the left of
the doorway. He leans over to throw off the burglar alarm switch.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come on, white collars. The day’s started!</p>
<p><strong>11. med. shot</strong>: As the tellers file out with their
trucks. Before they do, however, each one signs the cashbook. One or two
exit silently.</p>
<p><strong>12. close shot - matt</strong>: As one of the tellers comes
into scene. Matt examines the cashbook.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’re carrying too much money on you, Hank.
You better turn some in tonight.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How are you fixed?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I’m okay, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’ve got enough?</p>
<p><strong>2nd teller</strong>: I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Say Matt, I’ll have to have some money for
those Manville payrolls.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: About twenty-four thousand.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It was more than that last week.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Here’s twenty-five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Let me have ten bucks?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I’d
quit.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’ll pay it back to you Saturday - on the
level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I’ve got to get it back in
my account. If Helen ever finds out that I�</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Baby, I can’t give you anything but love .
. .</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Now listen Charlie. I’ll give you an I.O.U.
I’ll give you a note, I’ll pay your mortgage, it’s a matter of life and
death�</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Whose death?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’ll be yours if you don’t kick in with that
ten bucks.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Say pal, did you ever hear of a
Depression?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aw, nerts!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come over and see us sometime.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m not asking you to pay off the Depression.
I’m only asking you for ten bucks!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That mug reminds me of a guy with his second
dollar.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Yeah, what did he do with his first one?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Bought himself a pocketbook!</p>
<p><strong>15. med. shot</strong>: THE CAMERA PICKS UP Helen as she
crosses the main floor of the bank, reaches Matt’s teller window and
pushes it open.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Hello, Helen!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Matt, come here!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Come here, honey!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Hey, look out, somebody’s likely to see
us!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, is that so?</p>
<p><strong>17. med. shot</strong>: On Helen and a secretary standing
next to her.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh, oh. Look who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>18. med. shot</strong>: The other clerks and tellers,
noticing the newcomers as they file past.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Hey, psst!</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Oh, oh. Five ill winds.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: And blowing no good for the old man,
either.</p>
<p><strong>19. closer shot on helen’s desk</strong>: Shooting toward
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The four-and-a-half horsemen.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are they doing here? There’s no board
meeting today.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Search me.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mr. Dickson in yet?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not yet, Mr. Clark.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: When he comes in, tell him we’re waiting for
him in the board room.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: And tell him not to delay.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Looks like trouble for your boss.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Takes more than two tons of directors to make
trouble for my boss.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Sez you!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I’ve sent for the cashier, gentlemen. He has
a list of the loans that Dickson made last month.</p>
<p><strong>21. med. close shot - clark</strong>: As he stops in his
pacing a moment and addresses the directors further:</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: And as I told you at breakfast, it is time we
did something about it.</p>
<p><strong>22. close shot - schultz</strong>: In thorough accord with
Clark’s violent attitude is Schultz, a German, whose instinctive
conservatism rebels against Dickson’s liberal banking methods.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Mr. Clark’s right. Dickson will ruin this
bank if we don’t stop him.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Looks to me as if we’re in hot water
already.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: Gentlemen, I was just wondering�</p>
<p><strong>23. med. shot</strong>: As another of the directors, O’Brien,
a large, bull-faced, thunderous-voiced contractor, rises to Dickson’s
defense.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Personally, I think you’re getting
panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than
any other institution in the city. We’re fools to tolerate it.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: That’s what I say. And the only way to end
it is to get Dickson out.</p>
<p><strong>24. close shot - o’brien</strong>: He looks toward
Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Don’t make me laugh, Schultz!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Dickson doesn’t have to go. But he must agree
to this merger with New York Trust�</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What good will that do?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What good will that do? Why, it will take
control away from him. We’ll put somebody else in charge, call in all
doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That’s what good it will
do!</p>
<p><strong>26. med. close shot</strong>: Including Ives in scene with
Clark and O’Brien. Ives is seated, O’Brien and Clark standing by table.
Ives tries to speak again.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: It has just occurred to me�</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You’re wasting your time, I tell you.
Dickson won’t stand for it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: He’ll stand for it, if I have anything to say
about it.</p>
<p><strong>27. med. close shot - cluett</strong>: As he shuts the door
behind him. He is immaculately groomed, obviously cuts quite a dash with
the women. He looks off toward the men as Clark’s voice comes in:</p>
<p><strong>clark’s voice</strong>: Ah - come in, Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Here’s the list.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Look at this. Just look at this. It’s
outrageous. Henry Moore - thirty-six thousand. Manny Goldberg -
eighty-five hundred. Tony Consero - fifty-six thousand dollars. Joseph
McDonald - eighteen thousand. Alvin Jones - sixty-six thousand dollars
to a hotel that’s on its last legs. I tell you, people get loans in this
bank that couldn’t borrow five cents anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>28. wider angle</strong>: As the other men group around the
loan list, which Clark has put back down on the table. They all
scrutinize it carefully.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: And on what? “Hunches,” he calls it.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Some day he’ll get a “hunch” about a man and
give the bank away.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: He’s almost done that already. Our chief
teller, Matt Brown, is an example of that. He breaks into Dickson’s
house, holds him up, and the next day gets a job in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: Well, as far as I’m concerned�</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: A boy who should be in jail, handling a
bank’s cash!</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Shooting toward Matt, inside the teller’s
cage, busily counting the money he is getting ready for Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>30. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did you do with it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, ten dollars�</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother
was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>31. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward Matt.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, you think I’m lying?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: All right, I’m lying. Don’t forget you called
me a liar.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh honey, why don’t we get married? Then you
can handle it all.</p>
<p><strong>32. med. close shot</strong>: As Helen and Matt separate
guiltily.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Say, Matt! Matt! Did you hear the news?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No, what?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Pardon me. All the big shots are in a huddle,
and it looks like Dickson’s out on his ear.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, you’re kidding me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: No, I’m not kidding. Everybody’s talking
about it. Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I haven’t heard about it.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Sure, everybody’s talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>33. close up - matt</strong>: As he speaks sadly.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: If that’s on the level, there goes my
assistant cashier’s job.</p>
<p><strong>34. med. close shot</strong>: Taking the three in.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Well, I just thought I’d drop by and cheer
you up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I’ll be seeing you, Matt - in the
breadline.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: That ham I had this morning was very
salty�</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gentlemen, let’s get organized before Dickson
gets here. Schultz, can I count on you?</p>
<p><strong>37. close shot</strong>: On Schultz, who is seated next to
Clark.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What about you, Ames?</p>
<p><strong>38. close shot</strong>: On Ames, who is seated next to
Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: That’s the way I feel about it.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Ives, how about you?</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: Well, the way I look at it, it seems that�</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right. O’Brien?</p>
<p><strong>40. close shot</strong>: At other end of table, where O’Brien
is.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Well, you’ve got an awful fight on your
hands. That’s all I’ve got to say.</p>
<p><strong>41. close shot</strong>: On Clark, determined.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gentlemen, I think it’s time that we do
fight.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hello, Gardiner.</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Good morning. You’re on time this morning.
It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>43. close shot</strong>: As Dickson stops to speak to the
doorman. Dickson is a man of about fifty, whose looks belie his years.
There is a robustness and virility about him that is compelling. His
very walk radiates power.</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: John, how’s your wife this morning?</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Much better this morning, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Got a handkerchief?</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Excuse me�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Wait a minute. How do you feel this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: I’m feeling fine this morning.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: That makes it unanimous. I feel all right
too.</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>44. trucking shot with dickson</strong>: The smile on his
face disappears as he sees something which annoys him.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, Carter!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You know the rules about smoking . . .</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, Matt!</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib from employees</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Etc., etc.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Morning. Good morning�</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hello, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You here again? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What do you suppose anybody wants? Money,
money, money!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, I told you I wasn’t interested in
that deal, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I want to know why .</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Wait a minute. Where’s your uniform?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: I haven’t any.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You haven’t got a uniform?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: My goodness, you ought to have a uniform.
How much does one cost?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Why, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you.
You’ve got to have a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from
you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted.
Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I’ll tell you why. I don’t like the crowd
you’re mixed up with. Personally, you can have all the credit you want.
But for that deal - not a cent.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But listen, Tom, I�</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: As Dickson comes up to Helen at her
desk. A lady sits nearby. Dickson notices her.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pembroke</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Got my letter?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pembroke</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Hello, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Helen, you’re becoming more beautiful every
day. What are we going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Guess we’ll just have to sacrifice the
bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why - well, I�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why, the directors are waiting for you in the
board room.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Directors, eh? Long faces?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Longer.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I haven’t got any new stories for them this
morning, either.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pembroke</strong>: Mr. Dickson?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer
at the Guaranty. He’s going to take care of that mortgage for you . .
.</p>
<p><strong>46. medium shot</strong>: As Helen picks up the phone and
quietly answers it. Bill Saunders is standing nearby, still waiting to
talk to Dickson again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello . . . Mrs. Dickson on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You’d better hurry over there. He’s waiting
for you. Hello, dear . . .</p>
<p><strong>47. close shot - dickson</strong>: As he continues, into
phone:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Where are you? . . . Sure, well, come on
down right away. Huh? . . . Yes, of course I remember. It’s tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pembroke</strong>: But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were
going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The
property is worth sixty.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you.
He’ll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .</p>
<p><strong>48. med. close shot</strong>: He continues talking to the
lady, trying to get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Better hurry now. Goodbye. Good luck to
you!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pembroke</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, if Mrs. Dickson comes in, will you tell
her to see Cluett if she needs any money?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s the idea of turning her down? It sounds
like a perfectly safe investment.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: She’s a widow. I don’t like taking
mortgages from widows.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>49. close shot of the two</strong>: Shooting toward
Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: If she can’t pay, I’ll have to foreclose,
won’t I?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes - sure�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yeah - sure!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, make that uniform blue.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: One - two - three - four - five. Seven more
and you’d have a jury!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, it’s a nice morning, gentlemen. How
about two foursomes of golf?</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: Oh, I say, that would be . . .</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Say, you know, I found out something
yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You’ve got to hit with the left
hand, and from the inside out, it’s the only way you can hit
anything�</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a
little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you
don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, you would, eh? All right. If it’s more
important than golf, go ahead. What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: The check is no good.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The check is no good. The man has no account
here.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: Holy mackerel! I’ve been robbed.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, madam.</p>
<p><strong>sadie</strong>: So am I. And don’t call me madam!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, ma’am, you can deposit your money
here.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Is it safe?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: It’s his life insurance money, you know.</p>
<p><strong>bank guard</strong>: That’s all right. You come with me, and
I’ll show you where to deposit your money.</p>
<p><strong>52. closeup - charlie</strong>: As he quickly counts out
several thousand dollars in bills.</p>
<p><strong>53. close shot - three racketeers</strong>: Their eyes
glisten. Their mouths water, as they watch Charlie off scene.</p>
<p><strong>54. medium shot</strong>: Inside the railing. Cluett emerges
from his office and starts forward, business-like, when he suddenly
stops in his tracks.</p>
<p><strong>55. closeup - cluett</strong>: He stares off at the
racketeers. A look of fright comes into his eyes. His impulse is to turn
back.</p>
<p><strong>56. close group shot</strong>: The three gangsters. A quick
flash. Their eyes light on Cluett off scene, and they glare menacingly
at him.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: There he is! Good morning!</p>
<p><strong>57. med. close shot - cluett</strong>: He changes his mind
about avoiding them. His face breaks into a feeble smile of affability
as he walks toward them. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he approaches the three
men, his hand outstretched in forced amiability.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Good morning! Who do you want to see?</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>1st gangster</strong>: Yeah. We wanna talk to you about a big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Oh, yes. Well, come right this way.</p>
<p><strong>- med. close shot</strong>: Helen sits at her typewriter near
a railing, overlooking the bank below. Another girl stands by her, both
are staring off scene.</p>
<p><strong>- med. close shot</strong>: Helen and other secretary.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hey Pat, come here! Look!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: That’s Dude Finlay, all right - I’ve seen
his picture in the papers hundreds of times.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I wonder what he’s doing with Mr. Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Shooting down the length of the table. The men
are all sitting around the large table. Dickson is on his feet.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Gentlemen, you’re only wasting your time.
There’ll be no merger.</p>
<p><strong>62. med. close shot</strong>: As Dickson continues.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Why should I turn this bank over to anybody
else? I’ve worked twenty-five years night and day to build it up, and
now you’re asking me to dump it into somebody’s lap� Nothing doing!</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You can make a handsome profit on your
stock.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I’m not interested in profits. I’m
interested in the bank. In the depositors. They’re my friends. They’re
looking to me for protection, and I’m not walking out on them.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: How are you protecting your depositors? By
making a lot of idiotic loans!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Take it easy, Clark.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: My dear friends . . .</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right. I’ll speak my piece. Dickson,
you’ve got to change your policy.</p>
<p><strong>63. closer shot</strong>: As Dickson retorts:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What’s the matter with my policy? How many
losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years? I’ll tell you.
Not a single one! What’s wrong with that kind of banking?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Just pure luck!</p>
<p><strong>64. close shot</strong>: Ames, seated beyond Ives, now speaks
up:</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Conditions have changed. These are precarious
times. Banks today have got to be careful. And you’ve been more liberal
than ever.</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: Yes, and I’m going to continue to
be liberal . . .</p>
<p><strong>65. closeup - dickson</strong>: As he continues:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: The trouble with this country today is
there’s too much hoarded cash. Idle money is no good to industry. Where
is all the money today? In the banks, vaults, socks, old tin cans,
buried in the ground! I tell you, we’ve got to get the money in
circulation before you’ll get this country back to prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Who are we going to give it to? Men like
Jones? Last week you made him an extra loan of fifty thousand dollars.
Do you call that intelligent banking?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: He can’t pay his bills. How do you expect
him to pay us?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: That’s a fair question, Schultz. Now let’s
see how bad a risk Jones is. What’s his history? He’s been a successful
business man for thirty-five years. Two years ago business started
falling off. Today Jones needs money, and if he doesn’t get it, he goes
into bankruptcy and throws nine hundred men out of work. Answer -
unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>68. closeup - o’brien</strong>: As he listens intently,
Dickson’s voice coming in:</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: It also means his creditors aren’t
paid. They’re in trouble. They go to banks and are turned down . . .
more bankruptcies . . .</p>
<p><strong>69. closeup - dickson</strong>: As he continues:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: It’s a vicious circle, my friends, and the
only place to cure it is right here at the source. Help Jones and you
help the whole circle. Now, when Jones comes to me, I ask myself two
questions. First - is he honest? Yes. Second - is he as good a business
man as he was before? And the answer is - he’s better .</p>
<p><strong>70. closeup - clark</strong>: Showing his reaction, as part
of Dickson’s speech comes over scene:</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: He is not only older and wiser, but
his present trouble has taught him precaution. In my estimation,
gentlemen, Jones is no risk. Neither are the thousands of other Joneses
throughout the country . . .</p>
<p><strong>71. closeup - schultz</strong>: To intercut with Dickson’s
speech.</p>

<p><strong>73. closeup - ives</strong>: To intercut with Dickson’s
speech.</p>
<p><strong>74. med. close shot</strong>: The group, as Dickson concludes
his speech.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: It’s they who built this nation up to the
richest in the world, and it’s up to the banks to give them a break.
Disraeli said security is the prosperity of the nation�</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: Why, Disraeli didn’t say anything of the
kind.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, he should have said it. It’s as true
now as it was then. And let us get the right kind of security. Not
stocks and bonds that zig-zag up and down, not collateral on paper, but
character!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Character, hmmpf! That’s your idea?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Not at all. That’s Alexander Hamilton’s
idea - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are
his exact words, gentlemen. Character! It’s the only thing you can bank
on, and it’s the only thing that will pull this country out of the
doldrums.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Cluett sits at his desk, his face drawn,
panic-stricken. He is like an animal at bay. The leader of the trio,
Dude Finlay, sits in a chair directly in front of Cluett. The other two
men stand on either side of the desk.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been
crazy! I lost my head completely!</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: That’s your funeral. We’ve got fifty thousand
dollars comin’ to us.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I haven’t got it.</p>
<p><strong>76. close shot - dude</strong>: Shooting past Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Then what did you want to gamble for? If you’d
have beat us out of fifty G’s, you’d have been paid, wouldn’t you? Well,
we want our dough.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I’m sorry, Dude, but�I�</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: That don’t do us any good.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: But after all, you can’t take blood from a
stone.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: We can take blood from anything � If it’s
comin’ to us.</p>
<p><strong>77. med. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward Cluett. Dude on
opposite side of desk, the other two men still standing by the desk.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Perhaps if you’ll wait a little while, I
might be able�</p>
<p><strong>one of the men</strong>: We waited long enough!</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Nix. Lay off. Now - what’s the use of getting
excited, Cluett? It oughta be easy for you to lay your mitts on that
kind of dough . . .</p>
<p><strong>78. close shot - cluett</strong>: Shooting past Dude, as Dude
continues, slowly, deliberately:</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: There’s plenty of it in this bank - laying
around loose.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Good heavens, man! You’re not suggesting
that I�</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Why, I couldn’t do that . . . !</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: You don’t have to do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: All you gotta do is fix a few things for us ,
and we’ll do the rest, see?</p>
<p><strong>79. medium shot</strong>: As Cluett gets to his feet and
faces Dude across the desk.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: No, no, I couldn’t - I couldn’t do anything
like that. I�</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: Helen sits at her typewriter. A very
dignified, beautiful woman of thirty approaches her. She is Phyllis
Dickson, Dickson’s wife. She radiates refinement and culture.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Good morning, Helen.</p>
<p><strong>81. closer shot</strong>: At Helen’s desk, as Helen looks up
at Mrs. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Is that busy husband of mine busy?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s at a board meeting.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Helen, did you ever try competing with
a bank?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Well, take my word for it, and don’t
try it. It’s useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her,
but after all, you can’t scratch a bank’s eyes out now, can you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>82. close shot - mrs. dickson</strong>: Shooting past
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Oh, well. I guess the only other thing
for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When
he comes out, you tell him I’ll be back. He hasn’t gotten rid of me!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>83. medium shot</strong>: Helen laughs as Mrs. Dickson leaves
in the direction of Cluett’s office.</p>
<p><strong>close shot at door</strong>: The three racketeers are
preparing to leave. Dude has his hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Dude - there’s not any chance of my becoming
involved in this, is there?</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: You? No, you’ll be all right, so long as you
establish an alibi for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I know, but�</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Be sure you’re with somebody responsible in
case any questions are asked. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: But Dude, listen - couldn’t we make this
some other time?</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: Listen, buddy, you’re getting by pretty easy.
Quit squawking!</p>
<p><strong>85. med. close shot</strong>: As Mrs. Dickson stands watching
Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Oh, oh!</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Oh, hello, Phyllis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: This won’t do. Not during business
hours . . .</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Why, I needed a� Want one?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Heavens, no! Do you mind putting up
with me until the financial genius gets thru genius-ing?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: No, no, of course not. Not at all. Oh,
here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: What is the matter with you? You’re
trembling?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Am I? Why, I - I don’t know any reason why I
should be, unless of course it’s you . . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Being alone with you has always done this to
me. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: For a celebrated bounder, that is an
awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to
you .</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Well, you can. You always could.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Liar! You’re just suffering from lack
of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Here, here, here, now! Don’t you go
back to work on me, too. I’m getting tired of this. Besides, it’s
beginning to affect your looks�</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: �running around. Not your work. You’d
better start reforming, Cyril!</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: If I thought you were the slightest bit
interested, I would.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know
something? I’ve always been curious about your line.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Line?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Whatever it is that makes you such a
riot with women.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it
out on me. I haven’t had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the
day I was married.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: But you see, it isn’t blarney where you’re
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Now let me see, what comes next? Oh
yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?</p>
<p><strong>88. closeup - cluett</strong>: He is suddenly reminded of his
pact with Dude Finlay. Terror returns to his face.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Doesn’t that come next?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing
tonight, Phyllis?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: See, we’re getting along famously!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Most of the creditors I know personally.
I’ve seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and
mothers before them.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: I know, Dickson. That’s all very well. But
you’re taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid
in case of trouble. In case of emergency!</p>
<p><strong>91. closer shot at the table</strong>: All the men in the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I know what you mean by that. You want me
to hang on to our cash. Well, I don’t believe in it. The law demands
that I carry a certain legal reserve, and I’m doing it. The rest of our
money is out working . . . working to help industry . . . to help build
up business . . .</p>
<p><strong>92. closeup - clark</strong>: As he almost shouts at
Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: In the meantime, you’re jeopardizing the
safety of the bank. Well, we won’t stand for it!</p>
<p><strong>93. med. close shot</strong>: Of the group, as Dickson turns
to Clark.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You have to stand for it.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: But my dear friends . . .</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You’re forcing us to take action against
you, Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Go ahead - take all the action you
want!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I’m running this bank my way. Get that
clear!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to
consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York
Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He
insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes! You said it, Clark. That’s the only
thing that means anything to me.</p>
<p><strong>94. closeup - clark</strong>: As Dickson’s voice continues.
Clark reacts appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: Before I take a man into this bank,
and before I extend credit to anyone, I satisfy myself on one thing - do
I believe in him?</p>
<p><strong>95. close pan shot</strong>: On the other men - CAMERA
PANNING from one to the other as Dickson’s voice comes over the shot -
finally CAMERA STOPS on Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: So far, my judgement has been right one
hundred per cent. One hundred per cent! When I start going wrong, you
won’t have to take any action. I’ll turn the bank over to you. Then you
can</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: �and after dinner, we could go�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Oh! Oh, no! I think I’ve done enough
experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You’ve convinced me
that you’re a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you
highly.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Please, please don’t laugh at me, Phyllis. I
must see you tonight!</p>
<p><strong>97. closer shot of the two</strong>: Favoring
Mrs. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Tonight, Oh, never! Tonight I have
reserved for a very special occasion. Believe it or not, it’s our
wedding anniversary. Tom doesn’t probably even remember it. But then,
they never do, do they?</p>
<p><strong>cluett’s voice</strong>: No, they don’t�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: But I’m giving a party for him - a
real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and
everything. I’m really terribly excited about it. I’ve been planning it
for months.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Well�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Well, what?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Well, aren’t you going to invite me?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: You? No can do. It’s all set. Just a
few of Tom’s closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Now Phyllis, if you don’t invite me, I’m
coming anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Don’t be silly, Cyril. These are
respectable people. They’d probably bore you to death.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: No, they won’t. Not when you are there. Oh,
please, be a sport. Please ask me.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I want to be near you!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Don’t you know I’ve been crazy about you for
years?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Now wait a minute, wait a minute . .
.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I’ve loved you ever since I can remember,
long before you married Tom Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Why, Cyril, you’re insane�</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: No. No, I’m not. I deliberately avoided you.
I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won’t stand it any
longer�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Cyril!</p>
<p><strong>98. medium close shot</strong>: Phyllis Dickson in Cluett’s
arms . They suddenly become conscious of someone in the room and Phyllis
struggles free, looking off scene toward Matt:</p>
<p><strong>99. close shot - matt</strong>: From Cluett and
Mrs. Dickson’s angle.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Please forgive me, Phyllis. I lost my head
for a minute. But I couldn’t help it, Phyllis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Please stop apologizing so much.
You’re making it far too important.</p>
<p><strong>- med. shot</strong>: Matt stands there, in a daze. Cluett’s
secretary is not there. He starts slowly forward, hardly knowing where
he is going - CAMERA TRUCKING AHEAD OF HIM - there is a far-away look in
his eyes. His hand clutches the list of payrolls but as far as he is
concerned, it is entirely forgotten. Several people talk to him, but
Matt walks on heedlessly. He can’t get over the shock of what he just
saw. He always had been under the impression that Dickson’s home life
was a happy one. He never dreamed that Phyllis Dickson represented
anything but the height of circumspection. And now - Cyril Cluett, of
all people!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Matt, where have you been? Mr. Dickson wants
to see you right away. Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Say, I just heard the merger isn’t going
thru. Isn’t that grand?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah, swell.</p>
<p><strong>med. shot</strong>: Dickson sits at his desk when Matt
enters. When he sees Matt, his face breaks into a broad, pleasant
smile.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, Matt, get ready for the big moment.
Starting tomorrow you become assistant cashier. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>102. close shot at desk</strong>: As Matt stops in front of
Dickson. Matt cannot share Dickson’s enthusiasm. The scene he just
witnessed has taken the joy out of everything.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s all right. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: And what’s more, keep up the good work and
who knows - some day you’ll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .
Not a bad thought, eh?</p>
<p><strong>103. close shot of the two</strong>: Shooting toward
Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What’s the matter? You don’t seem very
excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sure, I think it’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm.
What’s the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if
it isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>104. close shot - matt</strong>: Shooting past Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aw, I’m sorry, Mr. Dickson. It’s just kind of
sudden, that’s all. Sure, I’m excited. I think it’s great. Only, well,
you’ve done so much for me already . . . I’ll never be able to thank you
enough.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Aw, go on, forget it. You came through,
didn’t you? That’s all I wanted. A lot of them didn’t think you would.
You don’t know how much satisfaction it’s been to me. It’s been swell.
Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, I�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I suppose you want me to fix that up for
you too, eh?</p>
<p><strong>106. close shot - mrs. dickson</strong>: As she stops in
doorway. She glances fearfully, first at Matt and then at her husband,
trying to sense whether Matt has said anything. She is quickly assured
by Dickson’s affable greeting.</p>
<p><strong>107. med. close shot</strong>: As Dickson comes toward her,
arms extended:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, look who’s here! Hello, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>108. close shot - matt</strong>: He returns her glance. His
eyes are unable to disguise his contempt.</p>
<p><strong>109. med. close shot</strong>: Dickson and Phyllis. He
releases her.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: If this isn’t a red-letter day for Tom
Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt
here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit
from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: It’s amazing that your sweet, lovely,
gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oooh! That has the earmarks!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Are you still here? Go on - go to work!
What do you think I pay you for?</p>
<p><strong>office - medium shot</strong>: As Matt comes out and moves
quickly forward as if anxious to get away from the embarrassing
situation he found himself in. Helen, upon seeing him, jumps up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What happened? What did he say? Did you get
the job?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>111. close two shot</strong>: She is perplexed by his
unenthusiastic attitude.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you’d
be thrilled to death.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come here. You know, a few minutes ago I was
in Cluett’s office and Mrs. Dickson was there.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well . . . ?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, he was making love to her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I tell you, I saw them!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In Cluett’s office?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yes, right in his office, the rat. I’d like to
take a crack at that guy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Wait a minute. Now don’t go away . . .</p>
<p><strong>med. close shot</strong>: Dickson is seated with Mrs. Dickson
on the arm of the chair.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes George . . . yes, sure . . . Oh, that’s
for tonight, eh? . . . Yes, certainly, I’ll be there . . . Yes, we’ll go
down together and have dinner in Philadelphia . . . Mrs. Dickson gets so
upset . . . That’s right. . . . Yeah. . . . Just as soon as the bank
closes. . . . Right. . . . Goodbye. . . .</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Helen, I’m going to Philadelphia, just as
soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What’s the matter dear? What have I done
now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going
out with me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, I did have a date with you tonight,
didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I’m terribly sorry. I’d forgotten all about
you. I’m so sorry, dear.</p>
<p><strong>113. close shot of the two</strong>: Favoring Phyllis
Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Now Tom, you simply cannot go to
Philadelphia tonight. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: But I have to go, dear. It’s a very
important banker’s meeting.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: I don’t care whether it’s important or
not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn’t promised so
faithfully, I wouldn’t have gone and planned the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, it isn’t so terribly important. We
can go to the theatre any time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: The theatre?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: That’s what it was you planned, wasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You can take some of the girls. You can
take Mildred - or Gwynn�</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: The girls! I don’t suppose it ever
occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young
man . . .</p>
<p><strong>115. close shot of the two</strong>: Shooting toward Dickson,
as he laughs boisterously.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn’t laugh
if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I’m still attractive - to
some.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, don’t go around being attractive to
anyone but me . . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Well . . .</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Don’t you forget that I’m still the head
man around here too. Now we’ll get the tickets changed for tomorrow
night. You and I are going out together. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Gardner’s here.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Oh, yes. That’s that lawyer. All right, let
him have nine thousand. Yes sir, I’ll step you around this town like
you’ve never stepped before. We will have dinner at the St. Regis - then
we’ll go to a nice, snappy show - then a nightclub - we’ll listen to
soft music, and who knows? Ha! - I might break down and dance with
you!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: All right. I’ll postpone the whole
thing until tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Happy now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>116. medium shot</strong>: He takes her in his arms and
kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Poor kid, you know, I have been neglecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Oh, I don’t care, darling. I love you,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes?</p>

the bank, enters. Sampson goes to Dickson with some papers in his hand.
He lays the papers on the desk before Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, Sampson, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Here’s the data on the Clyde deal.</p>
<p><strong>118. close shot at desk</strong>: Dickson is all
absorbed.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Good. I’ll take this along with me. Tell
Clyde I’ll see him tomorrow. I’m sick and tired of the delay.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I’m afraid he’s been stalling.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: That’s just exactly what he has been doing.
This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow
open . . .</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: He says he can’t get away in the
daytime.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: How about his nights? He’s too busy running
around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this
thing, or I’ll call this whole deal off.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>120. closeup - phyllis dickson</strong>: She stands by a
window, listening. There is despair in her look as she hears him making
arrangements for tomorrow night. Dickson’s voice comes over this
shot:</p>

dilly-dallying. People who can’t make up their minds . . .</p>

<p><strong>teller</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Where’s Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Charlie’s upstairs as sore as a pup. He’s
out fourteen cents, and he can’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib voices</strong>: Good night. Good night, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s keeping you?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, Charlie again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Say Matt, you haven’t done anything about
what you saw today, have you?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I’d like to take
a crack at that stiff-necked, horse dollar.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh now, don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing
her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now you’ve got me worried, dear. Promise me
you won’t butt in.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, honey - but just the same I’d like to
take a crack at that�</p>

<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m fourteen cents out, and it took me half
an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I remember once when your account checked.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And listen, wise guy - I’m setting friend time
clock for exactly nine o’clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Say, don’t annoy me. I got troubles of my
own.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><strong>house - night - med. shot</strong>: As a cab drives up to
curb in the middle of a downpour, and stops.</p>
<p><strong>and mrs. dickson</strong>: They are in evening clothes,

<p><strong>driver’s voice</strong>: 12:05.</p>

<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: My apartment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: I knew I couldn’t trust you. You told
me you were taking me home.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Come on up for just a few minutes. We’ll
have just one drink, then we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: No. I know the answer to that one.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: What’s the matter? Afraid papa will
spank?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: No. No, I’m afraid papa isn’t that
much interested. He’s too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make
stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers’ meetings. Too busy closing
big, important deals�</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Good for you. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>apt. - med. close shot</strong>: Cluett and Mrs. Dickson
emerge from the elevator and cross to his apartment, CAMERA FOLLOWING
THEM. Cluett fumbles in his pocket for the key.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: You know, there ought to be a
Congressional Medal for men like you. America’s comfort to misunderstood
wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Oh, you’re not so badly off. There’s
something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: What is that, Mr. Bones?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: A misunderstood bachelor.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: At door. Phyllis Dickson has just
stepped in, and Cluett follows. He closes the door and locks it.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: And now fair woman, I have you in my
power.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: I’m not afraid of you. You haven’t got
a moustache!</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I’ll grow a moustache by the time you get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Why, Matt!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: The butler said I could stay. I told him it
was important.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He’s not here. He left at nine o’clock. He
said you gave him the night off.</p>

<p><strong>133. close shot of the two</strong>: Favoring Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, I thought I’d like to have a little talk
with you.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s funny - now that I’m here, I don’t know
just how to go about it. You see, I kind of expected to find you here
alone.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Do you mind stepping outside? We could
talk�</p>
<p><strong>134. medium shot</strong>: Cluett crosses to the door, where
he stands, ready to open it. Mrs. Dickson stands by helplessly.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Anything you have to say to me, you can say
in the morning.</p>

you, I’d rather not wait. It’s about you and Mrs. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: About me and . . .</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Why Matt, what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I know I’ve got a lot of nerve butting in like
this, but I just couldn’t help it. I thought I could stop two people
from doing something they’d be sorry for.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I’m not interested in what you think.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’ve no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett.
Why don’t you think it over? It’s only gonna get you into a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I tell you, I’m not interested in your
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No? Then maybe you’ll understand,
Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he’s crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than
you. If he ever finds out, it’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: But Matt, you’re mistaken about the
whole thing. There isn’t anything wrong. Mr. Cluett and I simply came
here�</p>
<p><strong>136. close shot - matt &amp; cluett</strong>: Shooting toward
Matt.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Phyllis, you don’t have to explain
anything.</p>

father to me. What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like
this?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: That will be just about enough! Now get out
of here!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I guess I have said enough I’m just wasting my
breath talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>137. wider angle</strong>: Taking in Mrs. Dickson, who stands
slightly apart from the two men.</p>

you’re doing to him. You’re passing up the whitest man on earth�</p>

<p><strong>cluett’s voice</strong>: But phyllis!</p>

time - you’re going to need it.</p>
<p><strong>139. int. of bank - night</strong>: A series of quick
vignettes:</p>
<p><strong>on door</strong>: The vault door, partly opened. Over the
shot we hear excited murmurs.</p>
<p><strong>camera starts trucking back slowly,</strong>: until it takes
in the full room. A fingerprint expert is working on the time clock for
finger-print impressions. The medical examiner bends over the body of
the watchman, whose face is covered with a cloth. A detective in charge
of the proceedings stands around, looking very officious.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What do you say, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Oh, I’d say about eight or nine hours.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Well, you’d better call the coroner.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I was the first one to see it. I was coming
down the stairs, and there was the dead watchman at my feet. You coulda
knocked me over with a pin.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib from listeners</strong>: Gee . . . Can you imagine . .
.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Do you see that clock? Right there. That’s
where the bullet hit. When I saw that, you coulda knocked me over with a
pin.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Was there much blood?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Blood! Come on over fellas. I’ll show
you.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Get back there . I don’t want anything
touched until the Inspector gets here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oscar, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I was the first one to see it. I was coming
down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: No kidding. When I saw it, you coulda knocked
me over with a pin.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where’s Matt?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Matt?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah. He’ll have a tough time thinking up a
wise-crack for this one . . .</p>

<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He has?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Say, did Matt do it?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Don’t look at me. I don’t know.</p>

side of his face is swollen from Cyril Cluett’s punch of the night
before.</p>
<p><strong>inspector’s voice</strong>: Come on, come on. You might as
well tell me the truth. What did you do with the money?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I didn’t do it. I told you all I know,
Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You turned off the burglar alarm, you set
the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I wasn’t anywhere near this place�</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Sit down! When the watchman surprised
you, you shot him - what’d you do with the gun?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I didn’t do it! I haven’t got a gun!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You used to carry a gun, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>142. medium shot</strong>: Sampson enters hesitantly.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Pardon me, but I’d like to use my office
for awhile!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You use some other office!</p>
<p><strong>- med. close shot</strong>: The doorman, Gardiner, stands at
the door, blocking a milling crowd, as Dickson, who apparently has
already heard the news, enters.</p>
<p><strong>people</strong>: Come on, open up!</p>

here? Open up the door. Come on, open this door.</p>
<p><strong>gardiner</strong>: Shall we let the people come in?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Of course, let them in! You’re late
now.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Mr. Dickson - they’re going to arrest
Matt. They think he did it!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In Mr. Sampson’s office.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Now don’t you worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>- med. shot</strong>: Cluett comes out of his office, looks
around cautiously and satisfied he is unobserved, walks toward front
door of bank.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Then you did it and you did it alone�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What’s the matter? What’s going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I’m afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Why pick on him ?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: It’s an inside job. That’s a cinch.
Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here,
is in charge of the vaults, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>146. closeup - matt</strong>: Over which comes Inspector’s
voice as he continues:</p>
<p><strong>inspector’s voice</strong>: The burglar alarm was turned off.
The time clock was set for 12 o’clock. What more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: Somebody else could have done it,
couldn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>inspector’s voice</strong>: He admits that he set the clock
himself.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I did. I set it for nine o’clock this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>147. med. close shot - group</strong>: As the Inspector turns
to Matt:</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Then who changed it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What time did this thing happen?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: The clock opposite the vault was stopped
by a bullet at 12:09.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he’s
all right, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: If he can do it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Why, certainly he can. Matt, now all you’ve
got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and
twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I already told him I was home.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: That’s what he says. I got a man from
headquarters checking up on it now.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Good. You’ve got nothing to worry about.
Soon as the report comes in, you’ll be released.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Showing the normal activity of the bank in
contrast to the turmoil going on inside. Just a few people scattered
about.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Gee, what do you think? There was that
watchman, that poor watchman, lying on the floor right in front of me.
Oh, you coulda knocked me over with a pin!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: You don’t say! Dead?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Dead? He was lifeless! You know, I was the
first one to see him. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the
watchman lying on the floor, right in front of me. Dead! I tell you, you

comes into scene.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man’s voice</strong>: Boy, that’s the end of the Union
National Bank. That’s the trouble nowadays. You don’t know who you can
trust.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You said it.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Say, is there something wrong with the
Union National Bank?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Something wrong? Brother, that ain’t the
half of it!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: If you’ve got any money in there, you can just
kiss it goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Naw, you’re kidding�</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Holy smoke!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: If you’ve got any friends, you’d better
call them up too.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s a good idea. I have friends of my
own.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Imagine that!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What bank did you say that was?</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Union National Bank. They’re broke. Haven’t
got a dime . . .</p>
<p><strong>157. phone montage</strong>: Quick cuts of excited phone
conversations.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Listen, Jack, go down to the Union National and
take your money out of there. Don’t ask me how I know. I told you it’s
on the rocks. If you’ve got any friends, you’d better tell them too.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Better give all the men in your plant a
couple of hours off to get their money out�</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tell Mrs. Hardy to tell everybody in the
apartment house�</p>
<p><strong>tough guy</strong>: All right. I’ll get it or bust a few
noses!</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Holy smoke! I’ll get right down there
if I have to fly!</p>
<p><strong>another woman</strong>: Run down there and get your money at
once!</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib voices</strong>: Hello, dear . . . Hurry! . . . Union
National is sunk! . . . I told you to put it in the vault . . . I don’t
know what’s wrong with the bank . . . I wouldn’t trust anybody . . .
everybody’s taking their money out . . . Union National’s broken . . .
Why take any chances? . . . Hurry! Call the others! etc.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Closing your account?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes, sir. I’m closing my account. I wouldn’t
leave a nickel in this bank.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: It’s getting so a man’s money ain’t safe
unless it’s in his sock.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They’re all a bunch of crooks.</p>
<p><strong>jewish man</strong>: Say, did I know the bank was going to go
caflooey? What am I - a fortune teller or something?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my
goodness!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s the matter, lady?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh, mister, I gotta! I gotta!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, they only sign slips here.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Gimme your pen, please!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Will you loan me that pen of yours? I’m in an
awful hurry.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I need some more money! All of the
depositors are withdrawing.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: I know, I know. I’ll get you some.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: All I know is the bank’s been robbed and
a murder’s been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What are you talking about? He had no more
to do with it than you did.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Maybe. But I’m taking no chances. Why,
this kid’s got a record.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: So have you. So have I. So’s everybody got
a record. What difference does that make? You can’t go around pinning
crimes on people just because they�</p>
<p><strong>161. close shot at door</strong>: Sampson stands there,
looking off toward the group.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Mr. Dickson! Can I see you for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: No, I’m busy. See me later.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: But this is important, Mr. Dickson. Looks
like there’s a run on the bank.</p>
<p><strong>162. med. close shot</strong>: Dickson and the others.
Dickson looks off at Sampson, unbelievingly:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What? A run on the bank!</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: The lobby’s half filled now.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: As Sampson and Dickson come into the
scene.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Sampson and Dickson. Dickson’s face
clouds.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: They’ve been coming in steady all morning.
I have called for some extra police.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: All right. Send down to the vaults and have
our reserve cash sent up here right away.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: We haven’t much on hand, you know. If it
gets any worse, I hope we don’t have to close the doors.</p>
<p><strong>165. close shot</strong>: Favoring Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: The bank’s reputation wouldn’t be worth a
nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that’s all. They’ve heard
about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get ahold of our
available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get
my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys
anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>166. medium shot</strong>: As Sampson leaves. Dickson starts
out in the direction of Sampson’s office. He is stopped by his name
being called:</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Mr. Dickson!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: We want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: We’ll discuss that in the board room.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Oh, Mr. Dickson! We got a check on
Brown’s alibi. Do you want to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: All right. I’ll be with you in a minute,
Clark.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Dickson is by Matt’s side. The Inspector is
also in scene. Dickson puts a hand on Matt’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Now don’t worry, son. All you got to do is
answer the questions they ask you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>168. medium shot</strong>: As the Inspector crosses to the
new arrival, who whispers something in his ear. The others in the room
watch them, interested. The Inspector whispers instructions to the
detective, who leaves. The Inspector then crosses slowly to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>169. med. close shot</strong>: As the Inspector comes up to
the group around Matt.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: So you were home last night?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What time did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, about - uh - eleven o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Eleven o’clock, eh? Are you sure it was
that?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: All right, Kelley.</p>
<p><strong>170. med. shot of group</strong>: As everyone stares at her
curiously.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Do you know this young man,
Mrs. Halligan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Sure I do. He has the best room in me
house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>171. closeup - matt</strong>: He feels himself cornered. The
Inspector’s voice comes over the shot.</p>
<p><strong>inspector’s voice</strong>: Did you happen to be awake when
he came in last night?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Yes, sir. I was having me hot mustard
bath.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What time was it?</p>
<p><strong>172. med. closeup - group</strong>: As Mrs. Halligan
continues.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: �for the rheumatism, you know.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: It was late, I know. The Dooley
sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What time was it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What time did Matt Brown get in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Now, let me see - a half hour after
the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until
after�</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I don’t care about the Dooley sisters -
what time did he get in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: That’s just what I’m trying to tell
you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Was it twelve o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>173. med. close shot</strong>: Dickson, Matt, and the rest of
the group. Some show their amusement. Dickson and Matt, however, are
serious. Mrs. Halligan’s voice comes into scene.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: No, it wasn’t twelve - ’cause the
Dooley sisters . . .</p>
<p><strong>inspector’s voice</strong>: Was it one o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>174. close shot</strong>: Inspector and Mrs. Halligan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Yes, I guess it was one, ’cause . .
.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: It couldn’t have been earlier?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: No. It wasn’t earlier because . .
.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters
weren’t in yet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: No - because me clock struck four,
and when it strikes four, it’s one.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: There you are!</p>
<p><strong>175. medium shot</strong>: Matt speaks:</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aw, she doesn’t know what she’s talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Who don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: Listen here, young man - nobody ever
called me a liar yet and got away with it�</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: That’s all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. halligan</strong>: For two nickels I’d knock his block
off. I never told a lie in me life.</p>
<p><strong>176. med. close shot</strong>: As Dickson steps closer to
Matt.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Is that true, Matt?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Of course it’s true - and he knows
it.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, Matt. If you don’t tell the truth,
I can’t help you. Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aw, she was right. I didn’t get in till after
one o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: But I wasn’t here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I
wasn’t . . .</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Then where were you?</p>
<p><strong>177. close shot</strong>: Favoring Dickson as he leans closer
to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Matt, do you
realize you’re up against something? You’re being charged with murder.
It’s serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn’t do it. But we’ve got
to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last
night?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, if I get them out of the room, will
you tell me ?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You’re protecting somebody.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No, I’m not Mr. Dickson!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Yes, you are. You’re protecting somebody.
Now listen, it doesn’t make any difference who it is. It can’t be as
important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night? Come
on, don’t be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Of Gert, the telephone operator.</p>
<p><strong>gert</strong>: What a day, Mame! Everybody’s coming in and
drawing their money out. Gee, Mame - I wonder what started it.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They’re going
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Did you get the case for the
securities?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Mine too?</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out,
they’ll mob the place.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: The fools! If they only knew it, they’re
making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and
they lose their heads.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: What’ll we do?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I’ll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell
the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell ’em not to pay any attention
to what I said. Tell ’em to verify every signature.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Take your time, folks. Don’t get excited.
Everybody stay in line. You’ll all be taken care of. Don’t worry about
anything. Plenty of time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Now listen, everybody! Listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>181. med. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward Dickson, past
the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I want you to know that your money is safe.
This bank is in excellent condition. If you’ve heard any reports to the
contrary, it’s based on malicious rumors.</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib from crowd</strong>: Yeah? Maybe . . .</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s a lotta hooey! We want our money!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: All right. You’ll get your money - every
penny!</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib from crowd</strong>: We want it now! We don’t want no
speeches!</p>
<p><strong>182. close shot - dickson</strong>: As he addresses the
crowd:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen to me now. It takes time. I’ve got
seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can. If you’ll all
calm down, I’m making arrangements to keep the doors open until four
o’clock this afternoon and you can be paid today.</p>
<p><strong>183. medium shot of the crowd</strong>: As they cheer their
approval and return to their buddies.</p>
<p><strong>184. med. close shot</strong>: As Dickson starts back toward
the offices, Sampson comes to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: We can’t keep open till four o’clock. We
haven’t cash enough to last an hour.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Don’t you think I know it?</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: We’re still waiting for you, Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Well, gentlemen, we’ve got about one more
hour to go. You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>186. med. close shot</strong>: Dickson and the Directors.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: We’ll be forced to shut the doors. I’ve
worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You’ve
all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: What do you mean, help?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I know that among you, you have at least a
million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money
over here and I’ll stop this run within five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why
should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I have everything I own in it. It’s your
bank as well as mine, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>187. close shot</strong>: Clark and Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, is it? Since when? Judging from the way
you’ve ignored us, you wouldn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: We tried to reason with you, but you
wouldn’t listen to us.</p>
<p><strong>188. med. close shot</strong>: Shooting toward Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: The depositors you were protecting were the
first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why
don’t you go out there now and try and get some help from them?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Aw, they’ve gone crazy. You can’t reason
with a mob.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: No. You can’t reason with anyone else when
you’re in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn’t
listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish.
Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank
that you’ve</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: So, that’s it, eh? You’ve waited a long
time for this chance, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>191. wider angle</strong>: Taking in the others at the
table.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: You have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I haven’t? I’ll shut the bank first.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Say, you can’t do that�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I can’t? You just wait and see. If that run
doesn’t stop within the next hour, I’ll shut the doors. You know what
that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You’ll be forced to
liquidate. I’ll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred
cents on the dollar. What’s left you gentlemen can have. But I’ll
guarantee there won’t be enough to pay your next month’s garage
bill.</p>
<p><strong>med. close shot</strong>: As Dickson barges out. He stops in
front of the door, and looks off toward lobby.</p>
<p><strong>- dickson</strong>: His face clouds. As he stands there
watching the chaos, slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and
his jaw sets in grim determination. He starts toward the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>close shot</strong>: Dickson and Sampson.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Get all the big bills in the place. Take
them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives.
Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall
as much as possible. Count and recount the money.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: I hate to do this, but I’ve got to have
time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash.
Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I
want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the
Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home
Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: The directors apparently are having a battle
of their own.</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: Look at that mob. They’re going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: You know, this run isn’t doing the reputation
of this bank any good.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: My dear friends�</p>
<p><strong>schultz</strong>: How much longer is Dickson going to hold
out?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You know Dickson as well as we do. He’ll
shut the doors before he gives up control.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right, let him! I’m sick and tired of
hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don’t
want any part of it.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: My dear friends�</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>- medium close shot</strong>: Sampson frantically advising
tellers.</p>
<p><strong>sampson</strong>: Stall! Stall!</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Er, is this your signature?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Certainly it’s my signature. You’ve seen it
often enough.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’ll have to verify it.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - dickson</strong>: Seated at his desk, talking
into the phone:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Hello, Parker. Listen. Listen, I’ve got to
have a million dollars in cash, and I’ve got to have it quick. What? No,
no, no. Tomorrow is no good. I need it now. Of course it’s safe. Why,
the bank’s in excellent condition. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You’d better tell Mr. Dickson we’re
taking Matt Brown downtown.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Is the chief’s car outside?</p>
<p><strong>2nd detective</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Okay. Come on son. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>202. closer shot</strong>: Helen clings to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Matt . . .</p>

the room. CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to the Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What did you find out, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ve been trailing the cashier like you told
me. You’re right about that guy, chief. There’s something screwy
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Never mind all that. What did you find
out?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: He left here about an hour ago and went down
to Dude Finlay’s joint.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Dude Finlay?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>204. close shot - matt &amp; helen</strong>: Helen slowly
lifts her head from Matt’s shoulder. Her eyes widen as she hears the
name of Dude Finlay. Mike’s voice comes over this shot.</p>
<p><strong>mike’s voice</strong>: He stayed about half an hour, and then
he came right back here. He’s in his office now.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: That’s where I must have seen that
guy�</p>
<p><strong>205. medium shot</strong>: As Helen leaves Matt’s side and
crosses to the Inspector and Mike.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you say Dude Finlay?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Yes, why?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He was in the bank yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: He was here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He came to see Mr. Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Oh, Kelly - call me up in Cluett’s office
in about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kelly’s voice</strong>: What’ll I say?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I don’t care what you say. Sing “Mother
Machree” if you want to, but call me up.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: On the elderly lady depositor and bank guard,
among the milling crowd.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks.
Everything will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: But you said it would be safe! It’s his life
insurance money. Oh, please, I’ll go to the Old Ladies’ Home if you
don’t do something, please!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything
will be all right. Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!</p>

chances. No, I’m perfectly willing to sign everything over to you. What
more do you want? I need action. I’ve got to have it within the next
half hour.</p>
<p><strong>med. close shot</strong>: Cluett sits at his desk. The
Inspector stands in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: I hope you don’t mind me asking you a few
questions, Mr. Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Of course, yes. Just what would you like to
know, Inspector?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Where were you at twelve o’clock last
night?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: That’s very simple. I was home.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: That is simple, isn’t it? I assume you
can prove that if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Oh yes, of course. There was someone with
me. A lady.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Looks like you’re going to have no
trouble at all. What was the lady’s name, Mr. Cluett?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: If you don’t mind, Inspector, I’d rather not
say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she’s
married.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Oh!</p>

<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Hello . . . who? Yes, he’s here. It’s for

humming “Mother Machree.”</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: It’s one of the boys from headquarters.
He always sings “Mother Machree” whenever he’s got good news. Looks like
this case’ll be settled in no time.</p>

<p><strong>221. close shot - cluett</strong>: He feels himself trapped.

He keeps edging closer to the door with his back to it. His hands sneaks
down and grabs hold of the doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>222. med. shot of room</strong>: As Cluett’s figure

door.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: All right. Find him.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What was that noise?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Sounded like a locker.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: A locker, eh? Well, search every one of
them. He must be in one of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>227. close shot - cluett</strong>: From Inspector’s
angle.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Stand back Inspector, or I’ll shoot. Drop
that gun.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: All right, Jack, all right.</p>
<p><strong>228. med. close shot</strong>: The detective and Inspector.
The detective drops his gun, but the Inspector keeps his levelled,
toward Cluett, off scene:</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Don’t be a fool, Cluett. This is only
going to make it worse for you.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here,
or I’ll shoot you!</p>

<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Let me see it! Let me see it! It’s only
his finger. Get me a towel. Now take it easy, buddy. Take it easy. All
we want to do is talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Shooting over the teller’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>close shot - dickson</strong>: Still at phone. His coat is
now off and flung across the desk. His face is worn. Perspiration rolls
down his face. His appearance indicates he has been on the phone a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You can’t do a thing. You’re up to your
neck. All right.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn’t
have anything to do with it. Here’s your man.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Why, you must be crazy. I’ve known this man
for years.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: He’s just confessed. He’s been mixed up
with the toughest gangsters in town.</p>
<p><strong>234. closer shot</strong>: Favoring Cluett and Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Confessed! Cluett, in heaven’s name, what
got into you?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I don’t know. It’s all been like a crazy
nightmare, Mr. Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What happened? You’re not a thief. How’d
you get mixed up with these kind of people?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last
week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Fifty thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: But I didn’t kill that man last night.
Honest I didn’t, Mr. Dickson!</p>
<p><strong>235. closeup - cluett</strong>: As he continues:</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Yesterday they came to collect it. I begged
them to wait. I wanted time to think, but they wouldn’t listen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>236. closeup - dickson</strong>: As he reacts to Cluett’s
confession. Cluett’s voice continues over this shot.</p>
<p><strong>cluett’s voice</strong>: Then they suggested that I help them
rob the bank. All I had to do was turn off the alarm and</p>
<p><strong>237. med. close shot - group</strong>: As Cluett
continues:</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I didn’t know anybody was going to be
killed!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: What were you doing at Finlay’s this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: They took my keys yesterday. I went there to
get them back.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: If you were in a jam, why didn’t you come
to me? I would have helped you out. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>238. close shot</strong>: Favoring Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I
didn’t know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could
think of was that they were going to kill me . . . You’ll stand by me,
won’t you, Mr. Dickson? You won’t go back on me now, will you? I’ll die
if they send me to prison!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Don’t forget there’s a dead watchman
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: I didn’t kill him! I had nothing to do with
that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove
it!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Claims he was there with a married woman.
Doesn’t want to mention her name.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: He won’t believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it’s
the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your
wife - she�</p>
<p><strong>240. closeup - dickson</strong>: As he reacts electrically to
the mention of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>241. close shot - cluett</strong>: He slaps a hand over his
mouth, as if to crush out anything further he might say. He stares
wide-eyed and frightened at Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: My wife? What’s she got to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: No wonder he didn’t want to mention her
name.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: What was my wife doing in your apartment
last night?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don’t pay any
attention to me. I don’t know what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You just mentioned her name. What was she
doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: She just came up for a drink. Just for a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You’re lying!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Don’t worry, Mr. Dickson. We’ll find out
whether he’s telling the truth. I’ll have a man from headquarters check
up on it right away.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You don’t want to check up on anybody. I’ll
do all the checking up. Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Helen!</p>
<p><strong>helen’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, dear. I want to ask you something.
I know it’s a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to
tell me the truth. Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Last night? Er - why - uh, last night
. . .</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about
this. Were you in Cluett’s apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: In Cluett’s apartment? Well dear, you
see, I . . . I . . .</p>
<p><strong>shot</strong>: Favoring Dickson, but showing Cluett and the
others.</p>
<p><strong>cluett</strong>: She wasn’t to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn’t
her fault. Honest, it wasn’t. I begged her to come up. She didn’t�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Get out, get out!</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: All right. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>248. close shot - dickson</strong>: Left alone, he is a
tragic figure. An incessant parade of disturbing thoughts tumble over
each other in a hectic march across his chaotic mind. He grips his
throbbing temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought that
Phyllis was involved in an intrigue with Cyril Cluett.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Clark, you’re insane to hold out any
longer. Now let’s get some money over here and stop this run.</p>
<p><strong>ames</strong>: If we close our doors, our stock won’t be
worth a nickel.</p>
<p><strong>ives</strong>: My dear friends, I�</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ll lay you ten to one, Dickson won’t give
in.</p>
<p><strong>250. closer shot</strong>: Featuring Schultz and Clark,

<p><strong>clark</strong>: All right, I’ll go and have a talk with
him.</p>
<p><strong>full shot</strong>: Dickson sits at his desk, his head cupped
in his hands. Clark enters thru door of outer office, quietly. He looks
at Dickson a moment, then crosses to the desk.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Oh, Dickson . . .</p>
<p><strong>252. close shot of the two</strong>: Shooting toward
Dickson.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Dickson, I’d like to talk to you about the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: The bank. All right. Do anything you want
with it.</p>
<p><strong>253. close shot - clark</strong>: His face lights up. This is
a turn he never expected. He really came in to capitulate.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Now you’re talking sense. We’ll draw up the
option on your stock - say, eighty dollars a share. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>254. close shot - dickson</strong>: He is not even
interested, speaks vaguely:</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Eighty dollars? That’s fine - anything you
say.</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: Good, good. I’ll draw it up at once.</p>
<p><strong>255. med. shot</strong>: As Clark starts out of Dickson’s
office, elated, Helen comes in.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You want the rest of those numbers,
Mr. Dickson?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Numbers? No, never mind.</p>

<p><strong>matt</strong>: What’s he doing, honey? Is he getting any
help?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Something’s happened. He isn’t trying
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: They must have turned him down.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. He called some of the biggest people in
town.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sure, they’d turn him down. He ought to know
that. I’m going in there and talk to him.</p>

Matt enters:</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We haven’t got much time left, Mr. Dickson.
We’ve got to do something quick or it’ll be too late.</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Why wouldn’t you tell me where you were
last night?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’re not giving up, are you,
Mr. Dickson?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Were you in Cluett’s apartment?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh, I can explain about that later. You’re
losing your bank - don’t you realize what that means?</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Was Mrs. Dickson there?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Listen, Mr. Dickson, don’t let them lick you
just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You’ve got more
friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn’t be in
business if it weren’t for you. All you’ve got to do is�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was
Mrs. Dickson there?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well . . . uh . . . I . . .</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Aw, I don’t know what you’re talking about.
All I know is that you’re losing your bank and�</p>

<p><strong>and helen</strong>: Immediately following:</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah. I got an idea. Come on, let’s get to a
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>med. closeup</strong>: All of his beliefs are shaken by this
seeming betrayal. Dickson takes a framed photograph of Phyllis from his
desk, gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk.</p>
<p><strong>- clark</strong>: As he dictates to someone off screen:</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: �a thirty-day option on ten thousand shares
of stock of this company, now registered in the name of Thomas A.
Dickson. Now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as
you can. Hurry!</p>

<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Sorry ladies and gentlemen, there’s no more
money. You’ll have to go on to the next window.</p>
<p><strong>customer ad-libs</strong>: What do you mean there’s no more
money? etc.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Another cashier, another window, another

come out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Tom! Tom! Tom! I’ve got to get in

<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Tom! Oh Tom, darling - I came to
explain about last night . . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dickson</strong>: Cyril Cluett doesn’t mean anything to
me, Tom. I went out with him last night simply because . . . well, I had
begun to feel that I didn’t have any part in your life. That I was an
outsider. Tom, all we did was to go to the theatre, and then we went
back to his apartment afterward for a drink. That’s all it was. I didn’t
do anything wrong, Tom. I couldn’t do anything wrong. I love you too
much. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>265. closeup - dickson</strong>: As he stares dully out the

You’ve got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you
a hundred times. If his friends don’t help him, who is going to help
him?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything to do
with is all right. I’m putting my money in here. Why should you be
afraid? Give him a chance. Tom Dickson is all right! He’s perfectly
square. I’m putting my money in this bank! I know what I’m doing!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Open up! I want to put some money in here! I
don’t want to take any out!</p>

talk to both of them at once.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Get out of my way. I got money I want to put
into the bank.</p>

him.</p>

<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tom Dickson can have all my money any
time.</p>

at this!</p>
<p><strong>clark</strong>: We’ve been waiting fifteen minutes�</p>
<p><strong>dickson</strong>: You know what you can do with that! Come
on, take a look at this! You’ll see a demonstration of faith that’s
worth more than all the collateral in the world.</p>
<p><strong>277. med. close shot - clark</strong>: He has remained
unmoved, staring at Dickson, as if trying to determine what kind of ruse
is this.</p>
<p><strong>dickson’s voice</strong>: Come on boys! Come on Clark! It’ll

something.</p>
