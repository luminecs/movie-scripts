<h1 id="my-girl-2">my-girl-2</h1>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I remember before I was born, wounded up like
a fur ball in the highly overrated fetal position, luckily I’m not
claustrophobic, but on rainy days I still feel a tightness in my left
shoulder. So now that my stepmother’s pregnant, I understand what the
baby’s going through, and I’m not jealous at all, really, not at
all.</p>
<p><strong>view of the sultenfuss’ dining room table. vada, harry
and</strong>: SHELLY ARE SEATED. SHELLY IS VERY PREGNANT</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey you’re not eating your meatloaf.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: If I eat it I’ll throw up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well you should at least try a little
bit.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Then I’ll throw up a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are you sure you wanna get involved in
this?</p>
<p><strong>outside sultenfuss’ house, music is playing our
house,</strong>: INSIDE HARRY IS SINGING</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …windows are illuminated by the evening
sunshine through them firey gems for you, only for you, our house, is a
very, very, very fine house, with two cats in the yard, life used to be
so hard, now everything is easy ’cause of you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a
little more.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad, I’m trying. The chairs, they won’t
scrunch.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well I guess we’ll just set up more chairs in
the library and pipe the sermon in like we did with Old Man
Hasselmeyer.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Better fix that speaker, it makes the minister
sound like an astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Oh, hello Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi Judy, come on in.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi Mr. Sultenfuss.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Look who I found.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi Judy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Come on in!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s just a corpse.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You should be here when they bring in a body
that’s been dead for a couple of days, and they haven’t found it yet,
’cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in
a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you
know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the
body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I’m
seriously considering cremation. Judy??</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I think you lost on the raisin with the four
fat legs honey.</p>
<p><strong>living room, harry and shelly are sitting watching tv,
vada</strong>: GETS A DRINK AND JOINS THEM</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los
Angeles today, said he went body surfing.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t know if I can picture Uncle Phil body
surfing.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t know if I want to.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you
can absolutely say no if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: But Harry, I thought we decided we weren’t
gonna do this.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well the thing is your room is right next
door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we
might move you to Grammoo’s room, and use your old room for the nursery.
See we’re gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there’ll be a
lot of noise….</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You want me to move?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well not far, just down the hall. Plus
Grammoo’s room’s a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Okay, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay thanks, atta girl.</p>
<p><strong>outside, on the deck, harry is playing his tuba,
shelly</strong>: COMES OUT</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Harry? HARRY??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, she’s fine, she’ll love her new room.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Look we react to every kick this baby gives,
maybe Vada’s trying to tell us something too.</p>
<p><strong>bowling alley, vada and harry are bowling, close up
of</strong>: HARRY HOLDING UP HIS BALL</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The thing to remember is you must visualize a
spare. The parabola of the arcing ball must intersect with the pyramid
of the pins at precisely this angle of attack.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Visualize a spare?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: So, what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me? What makes you think there’s something on
my mind?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling,
you’ve gotta have an angle.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, I just thought it’d be nice if the two of
us had an evening out so we could… talk.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly’s already told me all about sex.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She told me too, I mean, she told me she told
you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I figured you did.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this
talk isn’t about sex, it’s, well there’ve been a lot of changes, and I
know you’re upset about losing your room, but the baby’s gotta go
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No it’s okay, I understand, really.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey that’s very mature, I’m proud of you
Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per
family, that way you don’t lose your room.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, why don’t you just keep your room and
we’ll put the baby in the back yard.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Don’t do that, you’ve got the whole
garage.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and
the weed killer.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad I’m kidding, you can have the room.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m thirteen, maybe it’s about time I got my
own apartment.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: My mother can’t have any more kids.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Neither can mine. She’s dead. It’s Shelly
who’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think I’m leaning towards passionflower, it
combines the traditional floral scent with the musty aroma of samba
wood.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What are you staring at?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s Kevin, I don’t want him to see me.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: See you? He can smell you from there.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh God, he’s coming over here, act natural,
totally natural.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Real cool Sultenfuss, you look like a
grasshopper.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He likes you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Likes me? He said I looked like a
grasshopper.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Boys always pretend they hate you when they
really like you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That’s ridiculous, so, if you really can’t
stand someone, then you pretend that you’re really crazy about them?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know. And I don’t care, Kevin’s a jerk
and I don’t like him anymore. He’s all yours!</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: If grasshopper is a term of
endearment, I’ve got a lot to learn.</p>
<p><strong>bedroom in sultenfuss’ house, arthur, shelly, harry
and</strong>: VADA ARE MOVING AROUND DOING VARIOUS THINGS</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: So have you guys thought of any new names
for the baby?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Umm, yeah, if it’s a girl I’m kinda leaning
toward Esme.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Esme?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, you know that kinda sounds like a noise
your nose makes, es-MEH. I mean it’s…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: And what if it’s a boy?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh Harry Junior of course.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend
that he doesn’t like you? And if he pretends that he doesn’t like you
how can you tell that he likes you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What boy likes you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s just a question, it’s not about
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Uh oh, here comes puberty.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada, I think what you’re talking about is
the fear of rejection. You see men will do anything to avoid looking
foolish.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, Shell, that’s ridiculous, where are my
needle nosed pliers?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with
you, it really means he didn’t have nerve to ask you out on a date, so
you’ll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the
next thing you know you’re ordering pizza and talking about your
favorite movie stars.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: So you’re saying…What are you saying??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey, ahh, guys don’t wanna appear over
anxious, so if you think there’s a boy that might like you, let him know
that you like him, so he won’t feel he’s taking such a risk when he’s
thinking of asking you out.</p>
<p><strong>outside, vada is riding her bike down the pavement
and</strong>: ARRIVES AT JUDY’S HOUSE</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my
new room tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: ehh…I don’t know I mean….</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is it okay if I drink this?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s okay with me, hi Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Well if it isn’t Vada, the grasshopper
girl.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Stop it Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I was kidding, it’s a joke okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We were just doing our homework and studying
for the test.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: And the next thing you know you’re gonna be
ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: In the future I think I’ll stick to
asking Dad for advice on embalming.</p>
<p><strong>vada is climbing the stairs coming toward the camera,
she</strong>: HEARS SHELLY SINGING "BABY LOVE" AND HARRY PLAYING THE
TUBA IN A BEDROOM AND ENTERS</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Baby, Baby, Baby love, my baby love, I need
you oh how I need you, why do you do me like you do, haven’t I been good
to you, so deep in love with you, Baby, Baby.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Assuming the baby’s a "Supremes" fan.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I bet your mom sang to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well if there was an article about it I’m
sure she did. She was always reading.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yes I know, it runs in the family. New
book?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Her favorite poet.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How about a nice glass of milk?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: And some taco chips so I can dunk.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You know Vada, being an older sister, you’re
gonna be very important in this baby’s life.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They’re enormous, I know.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Is there milk in them already?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No, the milk comes when the baby comes.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: When did you umm, I mean umm…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh, I was a very late developer, they used
to call me "Shelly Two Backs". All my friends had real bra’s, not like
the training ones I had.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Why do they call them training bra’s? It’s not
like learning to ride a bike.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I know, I guess it’s just sort of preparing
you for the rest of your life. It’s not easy being a woman.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re telling me.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s room, boxes everywhere, vada is lying on her
bed</strong>: THINKING TO HERSELF</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: All the great writers pondered the
meaning of life and death. I’ve been thinking a lot about my mother
recently, even though I don’t have any memories of her. I wish I could
see her just once, even if it were only in a dream. I know she’d help me
figure things out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Bless me now with your fierce tears I
pray, do not go gentle into that good night, rage, rage against the
dying of the light.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: He’s mad ’cause they shut-off his
electricity.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: I think he was referring to life energy
Mr. Phillips, which in your case wouldn’t cause much of a power
shortage, now would it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Vada?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The poem is really about attitude. It’s about
not giving up and…it’s easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but…that’s when
we should…force ourselves to push on.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: That’s very good Vada. All right, moving
on, I want to give you guys a chance to write.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Elvis, the king.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Elvis, the king.</p>
<p><strong>devon</strong>: Farrah Fawcet, I love to watch that girl
run.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Why is that Mr. Reid?</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Vada what about you, who have you come up
with?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: My mother.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Your mother?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I never met my mother.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I know my mom’s favorite color was pink, and
she ate peanut butter and banana sandwiches for breakfast, but that’s
not what I would call hard hammered facts.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I told you about the pumpkin didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for
Halloween, but she couldn’t bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks,
and it ended up under the Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was
this sickening smell permeating the entire house.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah when I picked it up it sort of exploded
and liquefied at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: There’s still a big spot on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh, is there anything else you remember, how
did you propose? Was it romantic?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root
beer float.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds
good.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Did she mention any contests that she won? I
mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She was talented, but honey I wish I could
help you a little more, it’s just that your mother and I had kind of a
whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group,
I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and
almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Was it a nice funeral?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did
a beautiful job, lots of pink roses…I used the white hearse. Hey, how
about this flowered wallpaper for your room?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: How about this?</p>
<p><strong>at school, vada is walking down crowded stairs behind
mr.</strong>: OWETT</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi Mr. Owett.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: Hey Vada. How’s your report coming?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know
where to start.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: You know I’ve been re-reading Virginia
Woolf, I think she’d be a natural for you, she led a fascinating
life.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Thanks, but I think I’m gonna stick to my mom,
she led a fascinating life too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. owett</strong>: I’m sure she did.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you
wouldn’t have to write about your mother.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: But I wanna write about her.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You’re crazy, what was her big achievement?
Did she invent gravity?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No-one invented gravity, it just exists.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Then what did she do?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well…I’m not supposed to talk about it, but
since I’m gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy
against the Russians.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Oh please, who do you think you’re kidding?
And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to
Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly
sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home,
she got caught, and they killed her.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: All right, so when did she have you between
all her acting and spying and getting caught?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That’s simple. She was pregnant with me…when
she went to Russia and she didn’t know…and then when the Russians found
out, they waited to shoot her ’cause you’re not allowed to kill pregnant
women anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So she had you in jail, in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well actually I was born in Siberia and then
they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Vada, if bullshit wore a bra, you’d be topic.
Come on Judy.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Ohh…ask anyone, ask my Dad! Could be true.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: How come guys talk so much when
they have nothing to say, and girls have plenty to say, but no-one will
listen.</p>
<p><strong>view of rug on floor of sultenfuss’ living room, vada
lifts</strong>: UP THE RUG AND EXPOSES THE LARGE BLACK PATCH THAT THE
PUMPKIN LEFT SHOWING SHELLY</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I used to come down here and sleep on this
spot when I was little.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: A box?</p>
<p><strong>top view of box, vada and shelly are sitting on a
bed</strong>: LOOKING THROUGH IT</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh Vada, what a sweet baby book!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s only filled out to page two. I was eight
pounds, four ounces. There’s so many programs, she was in a lot of
plays.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What’s this? December 8th, 1958?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t know, Dad doesn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, it must mean something. She was
obviously very sentimental.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: This is one of my favorite things, her
passport.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh Vada she’s so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Margaret’s my middle name, but everybody
called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No. You know they say, that it never rains,
that you can barbecue on Christmas day…instead of riding your bike, you
just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling
with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his
dry-cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little
adventure.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I wonder why she got a passport if she never
went anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well you’ve gotta be prepared.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m definitely traveling some day.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Why not now?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How would you like to go visit your Uncle
Phil in Los Angeles…next week during your spring vacation, you could do
research on your mom.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: But what about you and the baby? You need
me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh, but I’m not due to have the baby for
another six weeks or so.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yeah, it would be kinda great.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It would be fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: But Dad’ll never go for it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You leave your father to me.</p>
<p><strong>foyer of sultenfuss’ house, harry and shelly enter
through</strong>: A DOOR ARGUING</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: We should encourage her to spread her
wings.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She can spread her wings, right here in
Pennsylvania. You don’t send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could
come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what
else.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: She is not a child Harry, she is a young
woman, she’s on the brink of…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Disaster, disaster lurks behind every palm
tree.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You’re being narrow-minded.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, maybe when she’s a little older, I’d be
more then happy to bring up…</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You were just having a fight about me.
Wouldn’t you like to hear my opinion?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think that if I’m old enough to accept a new
baby, and if I’m old enough to accept a new room, I’m old enough to go
to California.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honey I know it’s fun to think about these
things but….</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I already bought a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I used my own money and got a great deal, it’s
a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in
Dallas and stay over a Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ah, uh, uh, bu…but…but I… I… Isn’t it against
the law to sell airline tickets to minors?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, Vada needed me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who
wasn’t having hormone surges.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh come on Harry, we’re talking about five
days here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I really think we’re going overboard for just
a simple school assignment.</p>
<p><strong>vada is back in living room, rubbing her hand on
the</strong>: PUMPKIN STAIN SPOT, WE CAN HEAR HARRY AND SHELLY IN THE
BACKGROUND</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: But it’s not a little school assignment. I
think maybe all of this is happening for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Reason? What reason?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Phil’s moving to LA, Grammoo’s passing, the
baby being born, Vada’s report, I think…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Signs. OOOOOOOOOOOH, let me get the loch ness
monster on the phone, you two have a lot to talk about. No, I’m sorry,
Vada is NOT going to Los Angeles, now I have made my decision and that
is final.</p>
<p><strong>at the airport, vada and harry are walking out towards

<p><strong>harry</strong>: And remember don’t talk to anyone, even if a
nun sits next to you, don’t talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No nuns, got it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people
are all so corrupt you’ll end up pregnant and on drugs…and don’t come
running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe
having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer…and
DON’T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It means…I’m a paranoid nitwit who’s never
let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he’s a paranoid
nitwit. So why don’t you just say "Oh Dad" and get on the damn plane
already?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Bye Dad, I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks, I needed that.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’ll be back in 137 hours.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Have fun.</p>

<p><strong>boy</strong>: You’re Vada right?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: How did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Your Uncle Phil told me.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or
something?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: This is California, anything is possible.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Well if I was looking for a victim, I
definitely wouldn’t pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150
pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or
is it just an attitude problem.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is
giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don’t get paid ’till
delivery.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Gee, that is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Put that down, I’ll…I’ll call the police!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: What are you gonna do? Tell them that…a polite
person helped carry your bag?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t think you’re very polite.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah, well I don’t think you’re very grateful.
A lot of people in your position would say "thank you".</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: THANK YOU.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t even know your name.</p>

Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how’s Shelly?
Your dad?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: They’re great.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How about Nick? Did he take good care of
you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He was very polite, worth the entire five
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh huh, well…good to know. Phil hands Nick a 5
note</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Give it back Nicholas!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But we made a business deal.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What ever happened to a good old-fashioned
favor huh?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Now Irving our family’s been dealing with your
company for over forty years now, now either the timing chain is here or
isn’t here and from what I can see it isn’t here, now you wanna come
down and explain to the customers why we can’t re-assemble the cars
because not all the parts are here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re Nick’s mother?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What, did you think he was raised by a pack of
wolves? Don’t be misled by the haircut.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who knew that when I started working in the
finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah
look, I’ve gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get
settled?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on…I’ll show you where you’re gonna
stay.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Here we go…not what you expected from
downstairs right? Now well put your stuff over here in this closet…you
can unpack later and this is where you sleep. Luckily this sofa bed is
really comfortable, I can tell you that from personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: She lives here too?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Ahh, that’s right, like one big happy family.
This is Nick’s room and uhh….</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: But…are you engaged or something?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Dating, seriously dating. You’re thirsty, want
something to drink? Sure you do, it’s been a long trip.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Sounds like you have a fear of commitment,
Uncle Phil.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s ridiculous, I’m…I’m very, umm, what do
you call it?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Committed?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Committed.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: So does that mean that you sleep here every
night?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes, it does.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well then that’s not exactly dating is it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Vada, I know that traditionally you’re not
supposed to do a lot of these things before you’re officially
married…but these are very, very special circumstances.</p>

special circumstances.</p>

fulfilling relationship. She’s remained a woman of mystery to this
day.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And you’re gonna solve the mystery?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I got it all figured out, I know she went to
Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I’m gonna go there and get
a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people
she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Then you’ll be all set.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Sounds like you’re very organized.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I had to be, I only have five days. So just
point me in the right direction and….</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’ll do better than that. I’ll send you off

Grand Canyon you’d charge a little more than…ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive
habit.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I wasn’t eavesdropping, I was overhearing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I didn’t ask for the money, Phil just gave it
to me.</p>

<p><strong>vada</strong>: Where’s the school?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Due to a devastating fire June 17 1963, Wilson

<p><strong>nick</strong>: I never did understand that story, did someone
find the needle or not?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What difference does it make?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A big difference, if someone found it we
should keep looking, if they didn’t we’re just wasting our time.</p>

drinking a little these days too.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m sure she found your lectures
fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Oh I doubt it…lectures are notoriously
boring.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No they’re not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna
be just like you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country
that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage,
besides, people don’t read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don’t
be a poet, be a TV repairman.</p>

it…it’s sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.</p>

sentimental value.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe it’ll fit my pinkie.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Don’t force it, you’ll break it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not gonna break it, I just wanna see it
change colors.</p>

it off, I want it back.</p>

<p><strong>nick</strong>: But we wouldn’t really be related right?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh no, we wouldn’t be from the same bloodlines

real date, when was the last time you did that?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Wha…what do you mean? We have a date every

school with Maggie Muldovan?</p>
<p><strong>hillary</strong>: Maggie Muldovan? Did you…know her?</p>

eyes mostly and the hair too and now she’s gone…she’s gone…she’ll never
get to see how well you’ve turned out. Oh… oh my God…Maggie! You poor
thing!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s okay really, I was just a baby.</p>

these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and…sometimes it gets
out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here.</p>

know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. "Chuck the Truck"
we used to call it.</p>

undertaker?</p>

husband?</p>
<p><strong>hillary</strong>: Oh honey, back then…people did crazy
things.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: They sure did! They got kicked out of school,
they married truck drivers…these are my mother’s greatest
accomplishments? I’m sure glad I came all the way out here to find them
out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Vada, wait up!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe not…but maybe it does. If no one told me
about this, I mean…maybe they’re trying to hide something.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe this Jeffrey guy is…is my real father. I
mean…look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and…and my nose, no
one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of…a…of a complete
stranger,</p>

<p><strong>vada</strong>: Bye. She looks a little like me when I was a
little girl.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Does she?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’m glad you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah, come on, let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: We have this school assignment to write about
someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles
and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I
looked at her high school yearbook and… and I called a few people and
one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call
Hillary Mitchell so….</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Hillary Mitchell? How’s she?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh she’s great…she’s a little crazy though.
Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman
I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and…he gave me your address and
here I am.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I told you it was a long story.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: That’s all right, you know what? You sound
just sounded just like your mother…she told great stories. Stories with
crazy accents and…special effects.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Special effects?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when
she was talking about lightning…audiences love stuff like that. And your
mom knew how to work an audience.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t know very much about her…I was hoping
that you could help me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No one else knows what this means.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: You see…the thing is, we always wanted to
work in a theater, so we drove out to New York, to Broadway where it
was…where it was all happening…and…New York was just full of fancy
French restaurants and we wanted to get married in one but we were
totally broke, so your mom found this little coffee shop…little tables
round the back…and real tablecloths on ’em, and a minister who worked
cheap…but when we got down to the coffee shop there was a sign on the
door that said Closed by the Board of Health. By that time it had
started snowing, so…we just got married…right outside in the snow.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: And she saved it.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well, we didn’t have a camera…so she just
wrote the date on the bag and said, "This will be out wedding album,
this will be a day we will never forget." We never did.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do you have any pictures if her?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’ve got something better.</p>
<p><strong>room with projector sitting behind couch, vada is seated
on</strong>: THE COUCH AND JEFFREY IS SITTING BEHIND HER OPERATING
IT</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: We called ourselves "The Appearing Nightly
Players".</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Darling, oh where is my chauffeur? You don’t
want I should walk to the stage? An actress of my overwhelming
talent?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: We performed on the beach one
summer…ha…everything went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: She had a…a beautiful voice.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Would you like…eh…to have these movies?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: More than anything in the world.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: It’s good to see Maggie again…and you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Umm…didn’t you ever wonder about me?</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Well I didn’t know about you until after
she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I thought that…umm…maybe you’d be curious
about how I turned out.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: I’d say you turned out just fine.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I guess what I mean is, my mother married my
dad after you…and then I was born, so I thought that…maybe you got
divorced because of me.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Wait…woah…woah…wait a minute…Do you think
I’m your father?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Honey I’d be proud to be your father,
really. It just isn’t so.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: Maggie wanted to have a baby…and…umm…I
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: oh.</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey</strong>: She didn’t wanna miss out on
anything…especially motherhood…it got to be a real problem with us.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: And I’m gonna use the movies when I give my
report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You better ace it…you sacrificed our whole
vacation.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well it’s a wonderful story with a very happy
ending.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sorry doc, we close for business at 3 o’clock
today.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ahh…this isn’t business. You know I…I found
this wonderful little Hungarian restaurant that makes it’s own strudel
and I…I thought you might like a taste of the old country. You see
there’s apple in there and…and cherry and this is the…eh… cheese but I…I
gotta say I think that cherry is…is really….</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel
does it, first it’s brakes then…. I mean I am not gonna let some
Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and….</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not a Podiatrist, I’m a Cardiologist.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an
arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, wha…what kind of arrangement?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes, what kind of arrangement? I’d be very
interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know exactly…what kind it is. Come on
Rose…what do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t want anything you don’t wanna give
me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And you certainly shouldn’t settle for anything
less that you deserve.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You stay out of this, look, if I had a red
XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn’t be handing out
relationship advice.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t think the color of the interior
is….</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rose this not the place to be having this…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I think this place is just fine.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You know how I feel about you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You like the way I cook…you think I make out a
great invoice. PHIL You and Nick and…and this…this garage are my whole
life…I love you. Sure you don’t have the greatest taste in music…but
there’s not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I’m
try… what I’m trying to sa…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You really think I look sexy in this
smock?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Is that a yes?</p>
<p><strong>at airport, vada is about to board her plane, rose and
phil</strong>: ARE STANDING NEXT TO HER</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Thanks for everything, you’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, you’re the best and I don’t want you
talking to anybody on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad already gave me this lecture. He’s gonna
meet me at the airport, then we’ll go for some pizza, then we’ll have
dinner in bed with Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sounds great, well you give ’em both one of
these for me.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Bye Aunt Rose.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Bye Niece, Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Thanks. Well, bye.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: …umm…Listen, I’m sorry…you had to sacrifice
your entire vacation.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Some sacrifices are worth it.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You mean…it wasn’t that terrible?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wouldn’t say it was terrible…it was…kind
of…</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: An adventure?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Part adventure…part miracle.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Write me a poem?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’ll write you ten poems. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good-bye, look in your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>inside plane, vada in her seat, she removes her
seatbelt</strong>: AND OPENS HER BACKPACK</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: In memory of barbaric customs, Love
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: Life is full of barbaric customs, I
just hope they all end with a kiss like that.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Arthur, where’s my dad?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: He took Shelly to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Is she okay?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Well, she was making a lot of noise.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What happened to Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She just had a baby that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: We have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh huh, a boy, you’ve got a new brother.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can do anything you want. You’re his
sister.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hey! Oh look.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He’s so tiny.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I know, look at his little hands.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m sorry I couldn’t come pick you up
honey.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I was pushing as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Did it hurt a lot?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>baby</strong>: WAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Let me hold him.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: O.K.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Maybe he’s wet?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe he’s hungry.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He’s okay…you just have to sing to him.</p>
<p><strong>outside, harry shelly vada and baby</strong>: ARE TAKING A
WALK</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: Things haven’t exactly calmed down
around here, I got an A+ on the report, Dad’s getting used to my pierced
ears and Nick’s coming to visit this summer. Other than that I’m busy
being a big sister. I’d like to tell my brother about my mom, how I got
to meet her friends and find out how special she was, I mean…she may not
have her footprints in cement but she definitely left her imprint on the
world…and I told them that even though it sounds conceited…her greatest
achievement was me.</p>
