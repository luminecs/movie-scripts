<p><strong>music</strong>: timpani roll and dramatic sting</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In his last adventure, Austin Powers, a
swinging spy from the Sixties, was unfrozen in the Nineties to battle
his archenemy Dr. Evil. Austin foiled Dr. Evil’s plan to send a nuclear
warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever.
Or so he thought.</p>
<p><strong>from the first movie</strong>: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in
bed. She plays with his chest hair.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I love you, Mr. Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: And I love you, Mrs. Powers.</p>
<p><strong>shot to match existing footage</strong>: Austin gets out of
bed. We see Vanessa putting on her robe from behind, and then
EXISTING</p>
<p><strong>footage</strong>: Austin and Vanessa kiss.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Let’s go out on the terrace. It’s a
beautiful night, we can look at the stars.</p>
<p><strong>existing footage</strong>: Austin and Vanessa gaze at the
stars.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Look how beautiful the night sky is.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Isn’t that the big dipper?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Austin!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, you know.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Hey, I’ve never seen that big star
before.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yeah, what is that?</p>
<p><strong>existing shot</strong>: The Bob’s Big Boy rocket.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: This isn’t over yet, Mr. Powers. I have
one more trick up my sleeve, don’t I Mr. Bigglesworth?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh well, I guess it was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Care for some champagne? Here’s to monotony–
I mean, monogamy!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing, luv?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Just putting on my–</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Vanessa, you’re a Fembot!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss
those?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can’t believe Vanessa, my bride, my one
true love, the woman who taught me the beauty of sharing your whole life
with another, the person who taught me the meaning of love, was a
Fembot. How will I ever go on? Wait a tic! That means I’m single! Oh,
behave!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yeah, baby, I’m free! I’m naked and
free!</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP
Austin’s NAKED body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera
reaches that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE
MYERS. Austin gives a big ‘who me?’ and we</p>
<p><strong>freeze frame and pan around like in the gap “khaki
swing”</strong>: AD. Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by “JAY
ROACH.”</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Shaguar, baby, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Dad, I know you’re against race mixing and
all that, but I met someone…</p>
<p><strong>klansman</strong>: Don’t say it!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I met someone… and he’s black.</p>
<p><strong>klansman</strong>: He?</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: Please welcome Tim.</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: Now Scott, tell us about your
father. Share with us.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Well he’s the head of an evil organization
that has aspirations for world domination.</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: And where is your father right
now?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: He’s in outer space, like frozen in a giant
egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat,
Mr. Bigglesworth.</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: Really? Well, we have a surprise for
you, Scott. Let’s bring out</p>
<p><strong>scott’s</strong>: father, Dr Evil.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Hello Scott, I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I can’t believe you’d do this to me on
national television!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: They offered me a free makeover.</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: Dr. Evil, we’ve seen a lot of the
fathers here today open up to their sons, sons to the fathers. Is there
anything you’d like to share?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Share?</p>
<p><strong>jerry springer</strong>: Yes, don’t you have any secrets?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: OK. I have a vestigial tail.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It’s more of a nub, really. The spine just
goes on a little longer than it should. Also, I’ve dabbled. I mean,
perform fellatio once and you’re a poet, twice and you’re a homosexual.
I remember once I was being fisted by Sebastian Cabot- but here’s where
the story gets interesting. He was lactose-intolerant. He could eat red
meat all night long, but one sip of milk and it was gastric hell. And I
remember we were caught in fragrance delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you
can imagine my humiliation at having Hank hear me say, “Mr. French, no
teeth.” One of my greatest disappointments is that I never became a song
and dance man. I could have been a quadruple threat, kind of like a
despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, singer, actor, and I would possess nuclear
weapons, the latter being the most threatening of the four. I once sat
on a bus and tried to will myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended up with
was a sense of failure and a mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth and
perhaps a grudging respect for the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. For
the most part I distrust dogs. I slept in a horse once. It was quite
roomy. On second thought, it was the Ritz. I named my left testicle
‘piss’ and my right testicle ‘vinegar’. I wrote “It’s Raining Men”, or
so the Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I also made a Marzipan voodoo
effigy of The Fonze while I was in coma after smoking some Peruvian
prayer hash, but who at the end of the day can honestly say they haven’t
done that?</p>
<p><strong>klansman</strong>: What are you, some kind of freak?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Shut up, jagoff!</p>
<p><strong>klansman</strong>: I’ll kick your ass punk!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No one talks to my boy that way!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I’m OK, I’m OK.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come Scott, let’s go to daddy’s new evil
lair.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman of
your organization, I seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small
Seattle-based coffee company several years ago. Today, Starbucks is a
far- flung empire with 2000 outlets worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a good
cuppa joe.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: If I may continue, I believe if we shift
our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium
quality coffee drinks, we can increase our gross profits fivefold.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Perhaps you’ve confused me with
someone who gives a shit. Might I remind you that I run the show here? I
demand a little respect.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, I think you–</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Silence! I will not tolerate your
insolence! Remember what happened last time.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: May I add, I appreciate you reinstating
me after our little… misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: How are things?</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: I have come to embrace the love that dare not
speak it’s name. To my right is my lover.</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA
Tour.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Doctor, you have a ‘milk mustache.’</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh, I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, I’d like to introduce the
Greek assassin, Oedipus.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Welcome to my private army, Oedipus.
Excited?</p>
<p><strong>oedipus</strong>: I could give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Kiss your mother with that mouth?</p>
<p><strong>oedipus</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Of course you do.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which
you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I have so few pleasures left to me, Number
Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it’s executions,
another day it’s creamy French cheese. It’s like frickin’ heroin.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the
answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: We had a few glitches, but I think
you’ll be pleased with the results.</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Send in the clone!</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an
approaching figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and
scarier.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: He is identical to you in every way,
except he is one-eighth your size.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Me.
Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come Mr. Bigglesworth!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mini-me, something to eat? No?</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Tired. Gentleman, I have a plan. As you know,
the most powerful man in the world is the President of the United
States. But he is just that- a man, subject to temptations of the flesh
like any other man. Here’s what we do: we make it seem that the
President has had “extra-marital oral relations” with- and this is the
kicker-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: With a White House intern!</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Uh-hem.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What, that already happened?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, how
about a frickin’ time machine? Does the president have a time machine?
Have I been scooped on that?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: No, not that I’m aware of.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Alright, time machine it is. As you know,
every diabolical scheme I’ve hatched has been thwarted by Austin Powers.
And why is that, ladies and gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Because you never kill him when you get the
chance and you’re a dope?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, because Austin Powers has “mojo”.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Mojo?</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, the
essence, the libido, the “right stuff”.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It’s what the French call a certain ‘I
don’t know what.’</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: If you’ve got a time machine, why don’t you
just go back and kill Austin Powers when he’s a baby or something?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, wouldn’t it be easier to use
your knowledge of the future to play the stock market? We could
literally make trillions.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Why make trillions when we could make…
Billions?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Why think small is all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: A trillion is more than a billion,
numb-nuts.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Zip it. Unveil the time portal!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the time
portal. As you know, Austin Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, I time
travel to 1969, two years after he was frozen. Security will be lax and
I’ll strike when he is totally helpless.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Can I come?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No, Scott, Daddy has a score to settle.
Austin Powers is the snake to my mongoose, or the mongoose to my snake.
Either way it’s bad, I don’t know animals. But I do know this: This time
it’s personal. Frau, Number 2, I’ll see you both in 1969. Come,
Mini-Me.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number Two,
you look very youthful and healthy. And Frau you look…right.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: OK, people, we now officially have a chair
problem. If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, I’m gonna
go postal. Mini-Me, I want you to meet Number Two.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mini-Me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Shy. Low blood sugar. Gentlemen, Phase Two
is beginning. I have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense. By
this time tomorrow, Austin Powers’ mojo will be mine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!</p>

Moving on, let’s discuss your new case.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: You’ll be doing a photo shoot. We
know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret
material to the highest bidder.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That sounds easy enough, you know what they
say: all work and no shagging makes Austin a dull boy, man!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Tres chic, baby.</p>
<p><strong>reg</strong>: Austin, the models are ready.</p>

<p><strong>austin</strong>: November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore
leave.</p>
<p><strong>ivana</strong>: Are you cold, Mr. Powers?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I once had a bad experience with frostbite.
I had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter.</p>
<p><strong>ivana</strong>: Do you know how we keep warm in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can guess, baby.</p>
<p><strong>ivana</strong>: We play chess.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I guessed wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ivana</strong>: It takes a keen intelligence to play chess.
Of course, you know what they say about men with big brains, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: They wear large hats?</p>
<p><strong>ivana</strong>: No, they make better lovers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Wrong again.</p>

shape.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let’s stop playing games with each other…

<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Where is he? In here?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, I came as soon as I
heard.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: There must be some kind of mistake, Basil.
Maybe I was drunk and I didn’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: What’s wrong with your neck,
Austin?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I took a Viagra and it got caught in my
throat. I’ve had a stiff neck for hours. Basil, is it true? Have I lost
my mojo?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: We’re going to run a few tests,
Austin. Don’t worry, old friend, we’ll get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p><strong>montage</strong>: Technicians in white suits and masks
transform the room into a love lair: A pair of Latex-gloved hands
carefully puts a BURT BACHARACH record on a turntable. Examination
lights are replaced with LAVA LAMPS. A tray is brought in with a
videotape marked “SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL FILM.”</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to give you a
sponge bath before we begin the test.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, miss, just let me finish this
article on the Suez crisis.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Alright, everyone, we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: But the test hasn’t even started!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Agent Haggerty was the test,
Austin. Not only were you actually reading an article in that Playboy,
but a candy-stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didn’t so
much as turn your head.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to
shag her but the article was so fascinating–</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I’m sorry, Austin, I’m afraid it’s
true: you’ve lost your mojo.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Without my mojo, I’m useless to the Ministry
and to Her Majesty. I think it’s time to retire.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not possible,
Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: We have evidence that Dr. Evil has
developed a time machine.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Our researcher noticed that these
photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling
back in time and creating alliances with each decade’s most despised
villains.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can’t read in the car. I get a bit
vomy.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Got it. I almost gipped.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Our data indicates that Dr. Evil
is in the year 1969. Luckily, we also have a time travel device. After
years of research we’ve developed a machine that will transport you back
to the Sixties.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: But Basil, isn’t that the new Volkswagen
Beetle?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: That’s what they’d like you to
believe.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I
was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I’m still
frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90’s and traveled
back to the Sixties? Oh, no, I’ve gone cross-eyed.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: I suggest you don’t worry about
those things and just enjoy yourself.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: This is smashing Basil. I’ll go back to the
Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for
tea.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Good luck, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sorry. Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby,
yeah!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I feel better already, man!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Care for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s my Beetle, baby.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: It was your Beetle. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin Powers, I presume?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Powers by name, Powers by reputation.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by name,
Shag-very-Well by reputation.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Crazy, baby!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Grab the wheel, would you?</p>
<p><strong>assassin</strong>: Ahhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Well, Austin, I think this time you may
have met your match.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, I’ve beaten Dr. Evil before, and I’ll
beat him again.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I was talking about me.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Welcome to my shag pad, baby.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Care for something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Or perhaps something to read?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How about a hot cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yes, I rather fancy a grind.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, Behave!</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Girl from Impenema by JOBIM</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Would you like a… mas-sage? A sensssual
mas-sage?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How does that feel, baby?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Mmm, lower.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Wait, something’s itching me.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Crikey!!!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, anyone home? C’mon lads, do it for
England.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity
stretches very sexily.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Would you ’like to see my etchings?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I think I’m ready for bed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ll get you some PJs.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: No, I’m ready for bed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, you’ll want to clean your teeth
then.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: No, I want to have sex with you,
Austin.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello Vicar!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I’ve studied everything about you- your
methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You’re the reason I
became a spy. Now, I’ve waited two years to meet you, so I say we get
busy making up for lost time.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but
I guess… I guess I’ve changed. Not to make a short story long, or to
ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum
until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the
first place, but- where was I?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh yes. Felicity, I can’t shag you. I’ve
lost my mojo.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I thought coming back to the Sixties would
bring it back, but it hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, don’t worry. I know just the man
to help you. He’s my guru. Ringo recommended him and he’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: There he is. That’s my guru.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Guru, I’d like you to meet Austin
Powers.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How are you baby?</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: My chakras are aligned and I am in a
perfect state of equipoise.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Good on ya. I don’t know what that means but
it sounds fab.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Guru, we need some advice.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Hold your horses and any other beasts-
of burden. I must lead my disciples in meditation and then I will help
you.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a
spiritual teacher and I have combined many disparate disciplines into a
unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that I learned from
my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a
disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis. He would say
to me, Sparky, love is all, life is breath.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Now, perhaps you are wondering where I
got the nickname Sparky. Well, when we were young we used to play a game
called “Stinkmop”. We would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it,
and play tag. I did not care for “Stinkmop” and a very wise old man said
to me ‘oh lighten up, Sparky’, and I don’t know, the name kind of
stuck.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Now, the reason I am a spiritualist
instead of a therapist is that ‘therapist’ often becomes ‘the rapist’
and that will not help us attain potentiality. Now what is potentiality?
It is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for
ourselves. People often say to me that they feel “nowhere”, and I am
going to change that to “Now here.”</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: And you have many assumptions about your
goals, but when you “assume” You make an “ass” out of “u” and “me”.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhhhh….</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: The being, or that which we call
‘ourselves’, is not the tinker. It is not the taughts. It is the Gap
between the tinker and the taughts! We are not our mind, we are not our
body, we are the Gap!</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: The heart of the matter is that you are
the heart of the matter. There is no “I” in “team”. Beer before liquor,
never sicker. Don’t take a wooden nickel. If your pipe is short and your
pump is weak, you better stand close or you’ll piss on your feet. He who
goes to bed with itchy bum wakes up with smelly finger.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Ahhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Finally, the path to spiritual awakening
requires the death of ego. Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the mantra:
Om Ay Vant Yu Uh… Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh… Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.</p>
<p><strong>disciples</strong>: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh… Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh… Mo Ay
Vant Yu Hu.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Go with God, and pay at the door
please.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Guru, I’m having trouble performing.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You know- my bits and pieces are a bit
sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: I’m not understanding.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve forgotten the steps to the Mummy- Daddy
dance.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Still not clear.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My flag’s at half mast and no one will
salute it.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My Willie don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Why are you beating around the bush?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s my problem.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Ohhhhh, I get it. No, I don’t get
it.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: He’s impotent!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, easy. Felicity and I were all set
for some hump Olympics and I couldn’t bat for six.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Oh, yes, I see.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You have no idea what I’m saying, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Not a word.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Guru, I’ve lost my mojo.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Oh, mojo! You should have said so. Well,
you’ve lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. You have lost
love.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Who’s Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: She was an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil. I
couldn’t have loved her.</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: Denial ain’t just a river in Egypt,
buddy. You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with
love.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, I get what you’re saying now! He’s
talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out!</p>
<p><strong>guru pitka</strong>: I am talking about true love. You must
stay and study until you are worthy.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No way, man. The only way to surround
yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby,
yeah!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have the
mojo?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: First things first, where’s your
shitter? I’ve gotta bleepin, turtle head pokin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you don’t
mind me calling you Fat Bastard do you?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: I’ve got a lot of demons kickin’ around
in my noggin, but weight issues ain’t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Alright, Fatty-</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: The name is Fat Bastard! I’m the
incorrect weight for my height and I was born out of wedlock, hence the
moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I’m not kiddin’. I’ve got a crap on deck that
could choke a donkey.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fat Bastard, the mojo?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Where’s my money?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: A gentlemen never discusses money.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Fine, you can take your in’ money and
shove it up your , you stupid prick! While you’re at it you can suck my
greasy, two-toned !</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: you!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. Bring in the money.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Alright, here it is.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mini-Me, fetch.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin
Powers is back in the Sixties. One of our best assassins spotted him but
he got away.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have his
mojo.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: There is another. Felicity Shagwell,</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Scott, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I don’t know, I was sitting around watching
the tube and The Courtship of Eddie’s Father came on Nick at Nite, you
know, and I was just listening to that theme song– Anyway it made me
think that maybe we could try and work things out. You know, you are my
Dad and I need you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You had your chance, Scott. I already have
someone created in my image. He’s evil, he wants to take over the world,
and he fits easily into most overhead storage bins. Has anyone seen
Mini-Me? Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put
a frickin’ bell on him or something?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Gentlemen, phase three. We place a giant
laser on the moon. Let me demonstrate. Where’s my laser?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mini-Me, don’t chew my laser. Not feeling
well. He has an ear infection, but tit’s OK. No? Nothing? Anyway, the
laser is powerful enough to destroy every city on the planet at will.
We’ll turn the moon into what I like to call a “Death Star”.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Nothing Darth.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Nothing. Rip-off!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Bless you? Anyways, since my “death star”
laser was invented by the noted Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I
thought we’d name it in his honor– the Alan Parsons Project.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The Alan Parsons Project was a progressive
rock band from 1982. Why don’t you just name it Operation Wang Chung,
ass?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: When you get your own evil empire, you can
call it whatever you want. Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate the
awesome lethality of the Alan Parsons Project. Fire the laser!</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the
Wihite House with no warning!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Actually, that was just footage from the
1996 blockbuster motion Picture Independence Day, but it would be a lot
like that. What do you think, Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was really
impressive.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’m nineteen, I don’t-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh- shh!
It’s Morse code. Let me decipher… it says ‘shhhhh!’</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You are so lame-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ssssss…huuuuuh…Shhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, what are we going to do about
Powers?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fat Bastard, in addition to being
extremely rotund, you’re a vicious killer.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: It’ll be my pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It’s an easy job. Without his mojo, Powers
will be…powerless?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby,
yeah!</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’ll thank me later, baby.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>ricardo</strong>: Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen and
the king laughed because he had too.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Crazy, man!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Let’s split up and scope the scene.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do- at least
not without me.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’re very exotic, baby. Do you have a
little English in you?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Would you like to?</p>
<p><strong>alan zeus guy</strong>: This is ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>london cop</strong>: Have you ever been picked up by the
fuzz?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: No, but I bet it really hurts.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary defines an
Eskimo hooker as a frosty prosty.</p>
<p><strong>eskimo</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Those are skin tight. How do you get into
those pants, baby?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Well you can start by buying me a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: You were great last night. By the way, I’m
Thor.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: You’re Thor? I’m tho thor I can hardly
thit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. Last night
I had German-Chinese food. An hour later I was hungry- for power.</p>
<p><strong>zeus guy</strong>: Oh puh-leez, why don’t you take a handful
of F-off pills?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Did you hear about the contortionist who was
engaged to be married?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yeah, I heard she broke it off.</p>
<p><strong>artie johnson</strong>: Verrrrry interesting- but
shtupid!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That’s not a pretty sight. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Until recently he worked security for the
MOD, but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: We’ve noticed that his lifestyle has
changed dramatically. He’s made a lot of cash purchases, he’s hanging
out with foxes half his age, and he’s becomes quite a fixture on the
London party circuit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I don’t know, but it looks like he’s
splitting.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I’ll follow him. You see what you can get
out of the girl. We’ll rendezvous later.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hello, hello.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who are you today, baby?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Robin. Robin Swallows.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Swallows? That’s an interesting name. Are
you English?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: German, actually. My maiden name is
Spitz.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows?
Either way, it’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: The pleasure is mine.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Charmed, I’m sure. How do you do? Yes,
quite. I always enjoy meeting new people. How’s your mum? Good. I love
shaking hands.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: So, who was your friend?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: His name is Fat Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It suits him.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: He’s my lover.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: OK. Would you happen to know if he’s in
business with a man named Mr. Evil?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: I don’t know anyone named
Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin does a
smug take.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Something to drink? Would you like a Mister
Pepper?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Yes, I’d love a Doctor Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Really? I said Mister Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: You’re a groovy boy, I’d like to
strap you on sometime.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>alan zeus type</strong>: Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: …and I’ll have a fried-prawn sandwich,
with extra mayonnaise, two whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad in the
hole, bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish and chips,
and… a Fresca. No ice.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I love a man with a large appetite.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: And I love a woman with big , so let’s
shut up and get to ing.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Well, what’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? Would
you?</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: I’d love to, Mr. Powers, just come
right… over… here.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’re a bit of alright.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Oedipus… use the revolver.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Oedipus… use the machine gun.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: Oedipus, Oedipus…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sorry baby, too late. He’s as dead as
vaudeville.</p>
<p><strong>robin swallows</strong>: You can’t win, Powers. Dr. Evil has
your mojo and it’s only a matter of time before he kills you and takes
over the world. Tell Fat Bastard I’ll miss him…</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: I always get in’ hungry after I get my
end away!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I never would have thought that a man of
such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous
lover!</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: You want some chicken? I have more!</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Frisky are we? Alright lets have
another go!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Get me the President of the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Dr. Evil, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Not what I want Mr. President, but I will
receive. In 12 hours I will destroy Washington, DC with a giant
laser.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: OK, Mini-Me, why don’t you and the laser
get a frickin’ room. Honestly. I will destroy another major city every
hour- that is, unless you pay me-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: One hundred billion dollars!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Dr. Evil that’s more than the entire
federal budget for 1969.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Don’t play games with me. The capitol will
disappear if I don’t receive</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: One hundred billion dollars!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: That much money simply doesn’t exist. I
don’t think l00 billion is even a number. It’s like saying I want a
kajillion bajillion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Come on, Mr. President…</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: “Show me the money!”</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: “Show me the money!”</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You know, kwan? Show me the money? No?
Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: It’s 1969. That movie won’t come out for
another 30 years, ass. They don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. OK, see if you understand this:
give me the money or I’m going to blow you to frickin’ bits, OK?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Talk to the hand!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding
Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, very touching.</p>
<p><strong>dr.evil</strong>: Okay, everybody clear the room!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic. This isn’t
working. I don’t feel anything.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, one last thing. I– oh.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I was just… right. Would it kill you to
frickin’ knock?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, tell me about the Nineties.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You know I can’t tell you details about the
future, baby, it could alter history.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Not details, just what it’s like. You
know, what’s the scene? Where’s it at?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: There’ve been a lot of advances in the
Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their
health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let’s see,
there’s an entire television channel dedicated to golf.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Sounds awful.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: It’s not so bad once you get used to it. The
Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself
and other people. I even got married.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: You? Married? What about the sexual
revolution?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Well, it turns out there were some
casualties, baby. Don’t you think you’ll ever get married?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: No, not until I get a little more
‘experience’ under my belt.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, written here on my hand, see?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Says ‘Oh my God!’</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, look.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity, I haven’t had this much fun since
I worked undercover in Amsterdam– ’66 I think it was.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: 1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch
cheese expert to stop Dr. Evil from poisoning the world’s water
supply.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I’ve studied your file, Austin. I want to
be a trailblazer, just like you. The Seventies are right around the
corner. It’s going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and
technology– it won’t be long before every flying car has its own
8-track.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: The CIA has always been a boy’s club until
now. Well move over, this chick’s taking over.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, your voice!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, I think I’m coming down with
something.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ll get some ice cream. Would you like
some?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Could I have two scoops of Vanilla,
please?</p>
<p><strong>ice cream man</strong>: Right away, governor. Would you like
chocolate syrup?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>ice cream man</strong>: Will you have any whipped cream?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I will, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ice cr@ man</strong>: Candy sprinkles?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes please.</p>
<p><strong>ice cream man</strong>: Crushed nuts?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, laryngitis.</p>
<p><strong>ice cream man</strong>: Here’s your change, sir. Oh, and
Austin–</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Basil!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Hello, Austin. What’s wrong with
your voice?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I just had ice cream. Listen to me, I have
dairy throat. “Mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin’. She
tied it to a five bar gate and kicked it’s little-</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin! Things are heating up, so
I thought it best to contact you in disguise. Felicity, your plan
worked. You and Austin track Fat Bastard back to Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: But how can we track Fat Bastard?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I planted a homing device on him last
night.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Yes, and we’re starting to pick up
the signal now.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How did you get close enough to plant a
homing device?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You… him? Just like that?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yes, Austin, we needed that
information.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Well, thanks to your effort,
Felicity, we now know that-</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Did you use an elaborate set of pulleys? A
block and tackle?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Anyway, you two follow the signal
back to Dr. Evil’s headquarters and then-</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I just can’t get my head around it, baby.
You’re so small and he’s so … not small. The sheer mechanics of it are
mindboggling!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Never mind, Austin, you two have
work to do. You must find Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I got it! A Chinese basket with a
counter-weighted ballast. That’s how you did it, right?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, it almost sounds like you’re
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Who, me? That’s not possible, baby! is
it?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: We’re obviously on the right track. It
looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: According to the readings, Dr. Evil’s
headquarters is over the next ridge.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Can I have a look?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Question is, how do we get in?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Mmmmmmm…mmmmm…</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, did you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I seem to be stuck in your dirty
pillows.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Where are the topographical maps that
Basil drew up?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I think they’re in the tent.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Have you got it out yet?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things do
you put in there?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, anything that catches my fancy.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: How do you manage to fit it all in?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, it stretches to fit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Are you almost done? I can’t hold it much
longer.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Here we go, one hammer. It’s amazing how
much this duffel bag will hold.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I do
have some bad news. Powers’ is on the island.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: How tedious.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Don’t worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to him
by using the girl.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: I have the perfect weapon. Frau?</p>
<p><strong>frau</strong>: Bring in the He-Bots!</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: It’s Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three
HE-BOTS enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan’s Run type
outfits.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots.
What kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity?
Their clothes are stylish, their posture is ramrod straight, and their
buttocks are tight, like tigers. And, each He-Bot is armed with a secret
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Poison gas…</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Machine gun…</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: And deadly acid.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Right. I object to the last one on
aesthetic grounds, but I don’t care how you get Powers, just bring him
to me. Ready Mini-Me? A one and a two and…</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Do you want everything to go back in?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat
Bastard-</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: It’s my job, Austin. You of all people
should understand that. Marakesh, 1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I know
your record backwards and forwards. You’ve had more sex on the job than
a Swedish stewardess.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: You’re right, Felicity, I can’t deny it. But
the world changed, and I changed too.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Ow! My back hurts.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m fine, just keeping packing.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Christ Almighty, it smells terrible in
here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It’s the volcanic sulphurous emissions.
We’ve put up some air fresheners.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Great, now it smells like someone took
a shite in a pine tree.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded into
the rocket. You’re ready for launch.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I’m just waiting to taunt my nemesis. I
have so few pleasures, you know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome to
my hollowed-out volcano.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: We meet again, Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Yes, the only reason I’m keeping you alive
is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Dr. Evil your plan will never–</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh, is that yours?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: My mojo!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You know what they say: finders keepers,
loser weepers.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Of course. Why?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Now you’ve got a couple of achers.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oww! My stomach hurts!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I don’t care if he is evil, you don’t give a
man a shot in the pills. It’s just not cricket, baby.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Take them away.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: She just hoofed you in the sack and you’re
going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard? They’ll
escape, dipshit. You do this every time!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You’re going the right way for a smacked
bottom, young man.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You don’t own me!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: I do actually. It’s complicated. Usually
it’s illegal but this buddy of mine… but I digress. Fat Bastard, I’m
leaving you in charge. I’m going up the moon to hold the world ransom
with my giant laser, I shouldn’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: What about Powers?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: He’s tucked away safely in his cell. He’s
harmless without that mojo. Guard it with your life. Number Two, begin
the countdown.</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Five, four, three…</p>
<p><strong>number two</strong>: Two, one, liftoff!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Colonel, you better have a look at this
radar.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What is it, son?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I don’t know, sir, but it looks like a
giant–</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Dick!</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Take a look out of starboard.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Oh my God, it looks like a huge–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Pecker!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Over there. A rare red-billed woodpecker! What
sort of bird is that? Oh goodness, it’s not a bird, it’s-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Privates! We have reports of an
Unidentified Flying Object. It has a long, smooth shaft, complete
with-</p>
<p><strong>umpire</strong>: Two balls! No strikes. What is that? It
looks just like an enormous–</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Get on the horn to British Intelligence and
let them know about this.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: How are we going to get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Why don’t you just shag Fat Bastard
again?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, that is it! I don’t know what
happened to you in the Nineties, but I’m still here, in the Sixties, and
I still swing! Don’t try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you
lost your mojo! That one hurts.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Ouch, baby, very ouch. I’m wounded.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: I’m sorry, Austin, that was a cheap
shot.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, baby, you’re right. I was wrong to judge
you. I guess I am… jealous.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and
crazy and free. He could never be jealous.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That Austin is gone. I’ve changed. I knew
someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life
isn’t about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it’s about
caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an
evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did… love her.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Was that your wife?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Yes, Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Listen, Austin, I can’t pretend to
understand everything you’ve gone through, but I trust you. I’ll make
you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I’ll give monogamy a try.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: With me?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yes, silly.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Groovy, baby!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: We need to lure the guard inside and get
his key.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately
ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come
to investigate. Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift
punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob’s
your uncle, and we’ve got the key. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: That might work, but how about this?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: What do you think of these, my man?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: It’s very hot in here, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: It’s very hot in here, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m very firmly wedged.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: If you want something done…</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Almost… got it!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Let’s go get my mojo!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Has anyone seen my gravity booties?
Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin’ moon base. Hello, we’re on the
moon, no gravity? Mini-Me? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: My frickin’ mascot is stuck to the
ceiling, OK? Not good. Papa not happy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Somebody get the stick. Hold on, Mini-Me.
Begin laser-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: . Begin-</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Begin laser ignition sequence.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Lunar alignment in 6 hours.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Where’s your mojo, Austin?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: It’s Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS
Suddenly, the lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on
trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Watch out, baby, He-Bots!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I can’t fight them without my mojo.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Who said anything about fighting?</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: seductive music Felicity does a very
seductive dance, with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots
EXPLODE, succumbing to her mojo.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Smashing, Felicity, you were making me very
horny, man! Extremely randy, indeed!</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: C’mon, give the lads a show. Take of
your top. Put ’em on the glass! Make ’em bounce. Let’s have a look at
your tits.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Fat Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Looking for this, Mr. Powers?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: I give the orders, for brains. Guards,
take them back to their cells.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Hold on, let me ask you one question.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Alright, I guess I owe you that much
for a night of carnal ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: What kind of stupid ass question is
that? I’m in’ rich and I’m up to my tits in clean stinky.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: You didn’t answer my question, are you
happy?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: It’s about my girth isn’t it? Sure I
could lose a few pounds, but I could shiva git!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Of course I’m not happy. Look at me,
I’m a big fat slob. I’ve got bigger titties than you do! I’ve got more
in’ chins than a Chinese phone book. I’ve got more crack cheese than a
in’ dairy. I’ve nay seen ma willie in two years. That’s enough time to
declare it legally deed! I can’t stop eating. I eat because I’m unhappy
and I’m unhappy because I eat. I’m caught in a cycle and there’s no
escape!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there’s a thin
bastard, trying to get out</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: Maybe there’s big crap inside me trying
to get out, jack-ass! Enough of your in’ new age aphorisms. Listen, I’ve
run the gamut of self- help books. “Food isn’t love”, right, but how do
you get it from the page to the in’ fork? I’m so weak, I hate myself.
I’m for shite. Here, take the mojo.</p>
<p><strong>fat bastard</strong>: I appreciate you trying to reach me, no
one can do it for me, I know this now. There’s a hole in my soul that
food won’t fill. This is the beginning of a new me. I’m gonna go to the
gym everyday. If you’ll excuse me, there’s someone I have to get in
touch with and forgive… myself. Sorry. I farted. It’s a long road
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hold on, I have something very important to
do.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling.
Fancy a shag?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, we don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: C’mon, luv, let’s hop on the good foot and
do the bad thing!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Dr. Evil’s taken his laser to the moon.
The world is in danger.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Right, the moon. I think I know someone who
can give us a lift.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: There’s been some sort of delay in the
launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but we understand that America’s first
manned mission to the moon will be blasting off shortly.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Gor blimey, you’d have to be a rocket
scientist to figure this stuff out.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut</strong>: I am a rocket scientist.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: We will have lift-off in T minus
10 seconds… 9… 8… etc.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold
my hand.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has
cleared the tower and is heading for a rendezvous with the moon.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Yaaaaa-hoooo!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, you have achieved lunar
orbit. How was that lift-off?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: To be honest it was terrifying. It felt like
sitting on top of a bomb. As I punched through the atmosphere, I said
‘Oh my God!’ and I soiled myself.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Happens all the time in that
situation.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I
said oh ‘my God!’</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Basil, it was amazing!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Prepare for moon landing. We only
have one hour until Dr. Evil fires the laser!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Mission control, the swinger has landed.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: This is one small step for man, but a giant
step for shagging. Can you imagine it, baby, weightless? The
permutations are mind-boggling.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Naughty boy!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: God Save the Queen.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: The Queen? This is an American
show, goddammit. Let’s roll that footage we shot last week in the
studio.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Position the laser.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Get me the President.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Mr. President, your time is up. This is
your last chance to pay 100 billion dollars or see Washington DC
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: What? I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Pay me 100 billion dollars or see
Washington DC destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’m sorry, I just can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: How about now?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: The Capital will be destroyed-</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sorry! I just can’t- I think it’s that
alarm.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Could someone shut off that frickin’
alarm? I’m trying to hold the free world hostage here. Honestly.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That’s
more money than is in the entire Federal Treasury!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Oh well, I guess you have one minute to-
“show me the money”!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I still don’t know what that means. I
can’t show you the money because we don’t have the money.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Then I suppose you’re up shit’s crick
without a paddle.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Gentlemen, Austin has landed on
the moon. We’ll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world
will be destroyed!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Let’s find Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, you’ve done it! You got
Dr. Evil!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo working
overtime.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, I’m going ahead. Cover my
rear!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Oh, behave!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Poor little bugger. He’s so small, he’s like
a dog or something.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Poor little bugger. Felicity, be careful!
Dr. Evil is still alive! Felicity?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Alright, slap-head, turn around. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting something?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity! What have you done to her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Don’t worry, she’s not dead… yet.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Don’t worry about me Austin. You’ve got to
save the world!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It looks like you have a choice, Powers:
save the world, or save your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’ve got my mojo back, man, I can do
both.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: We’ll see. Fire the laser!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Hands off my joystick, baby.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Damn you, Powers!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Warning! Self-destruct sequence
initiated!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do
both.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Perhaps you spoke too soon.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake up! Please
God, don’t take her away.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity, you have to understand, I thought
I had my mojo back. This isn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn’t say
it before, but I really do love you! Dr. Evil, I’ll kill him!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You make love to your wife out of duty,
your mistress for pleasure, and a Roman boy for ecstasy. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I have to commandeer this vehicle. Hey,
aren’t you Hutch?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paul michael glaser</strong>: I’m Starsky.</p>
<p><strong>david soul</strong>: I’m Hutch.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Iceberg, dead ahead!</p>
<p><strong>james cameron</strong>: I’m king of the world!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I’m going to kill you, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Before you do that, know this: Austin, I
am… your… father.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: No. I can’t back that up. I was just
grasping at straws. I had nothing. But isn’t it interesting, Mr. Powers,
you really have become a product of the Nineties.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: You’re more interested in your job as
glorified policeman than you are in love. You won the battle, but I won
the war. Love means nothing, you’ve proved it.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I didn’t think that Felicity was going to
die, man.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: What a cowardly response. I’m disappointed
really. You have the power to go back in time and save her, but it means
letting me go.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going to be?
Me or the girl?</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: It looks like you have a choice: save the
world, or save your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I choose love, baby.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Felicity, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: But I thought-</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: That was another place and another time,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Can’t. Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Sorry, baby, I got a little over-
stimulated.</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Fire the laser!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Use your mojo!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: I don’t have it!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Trust me, you do!</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: He did it, he saved the world! Of
course, I thought he might.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, you did it!</p>
<p><strong>austin</strong>: Uh-oh. I think I just got my mojo back.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, you had it all along. No one can
take your, mojo away from you!</p>
<p><strong>dr. evil</strong>: Good-bye, Mr. Powers, for the last
time.</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: Sir, you better have a look at this
radar.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>radar operator</strong>: don’t know, sir. It’s hard to
describe. It’s… it’s-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Just a little prick!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: All done! Good lord, what is that? If I
didn’t know better I’d say it’s a-</p>
<p><strong>chinese teacher</strong>: Wang!</p>
<p><strong>chinese teacher</strong>: Pay attention!</p>
<p><strong>chinese student</strong>: I’m sorry, Comrade Teacher. was
distracted by that enormous flying-</p>
<p><strong>rachel hunter</strong>: Rod?</p>
<p><strong>rod stewart</strong>: Yes, Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>rachel hunter</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rod stewart</strong>: It looks like a giant-</p>
<p><strong>old lady teacher</strong>: Penis! The male reproductive
organ. Also known as tallywhackers, wankers, schlongs, or–</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Peters!</p>
<p><strong>captain peters</strong>: Yes, sir?</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Any word from Austin?</p>
<p><strong>captain peters</strong>: We’ve picked up his signal, but the
lunar base seems to self-destructing.</p>
<p><strong>basil exposition</strong>: Austin, if you can hear me, use
the time portal! There’s no time to get to the lunar module! Use the
time portal!</p>
<p><strong>felicity</strong>: Austin, you have to get to the time
portal!</p>
