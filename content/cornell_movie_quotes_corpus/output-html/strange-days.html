<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: Yeah. Boot it.</p>
<p><strong>our voice</strong>: Okay. It’s goin’. I’m recording.</p>
<p><strong>lane</strong>: Good one, dickhead. Thanks for waitin’ till I
get this fuckin thing on. You tryin’ ta I.D. me, or what?</p>
<p><strong>lane</strong>: Next alley… just pull in slow. Hurry up will
ya. Here.</p>
<p><strong>lane</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>our voice</strong>: Don’t move, don’t talk, don’t do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lane</strong>: Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: This is great… the doors are all locked. Who
are these losers, friends of yours?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Wow… the gas tank is a nice touch. Oh, oh,
end of the line boys.</p>
<p><strong>lane</strong>: Come on! Fucking jump man!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Goddamnit! You know I don’t deal in snuff.
How many times I hafta tell you?!</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Don’t have a fucking coronary, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Well you could’ve at least warned me. You
know I hate the zap… when they die. It just brings down your whole day.
Jeez, Tick.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: How’d you get the tape? Why didn’t the cops
put it in evidence?</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: With all the blood I guess they didn’t see the
rig. Guy had it under a wig.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, but how’d it get to you?</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: I got ways, Lenny, I got ways. Okay, okay… I
got a deal with some a the paramedics. My guy pages me and I pick it up
at the morgue. So whaddya think? This clip’s gotta be worth at least a
grand. Right?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tick. Not to dash your hopes, but I don’t
deal this kind of product, you know that. I’ll give you four for it,
cause I’ve gotta cut off the last bit. And my customers want uncut.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Fuck that! The last part’s the best. You
dry-dive six stories and blammo! Jack right into the Big Black.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I don’t deal black-jack clips! It’s policy. I
got ethics here.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Yeah, when did that start? Come on, man! It’s
what people want to see, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So lay it off to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Come on, Lenny. I got expenses. I got to get
this rig fixed. Look at it…</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Give me six at least. This’s a good clip,
here. Gets you pumpin’.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, well, the first part’s okay. Better
than the usual soaps you bring me.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Now that is cold, Lenny. I always bring you
choice.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some
girl in a fight with her boyfriend… it’s a test-pattern. Nothing
happens. I’m snorin’.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Hey, you’re always saying, ‘Bring me real
life. Bring me street life. And, like, one man’s mundane and desperate
existence is another man’s Technicolor.’</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I said that? Look, I’ll take it for five, and
you’ll make out okay, because in this case it’s pure cream, you don’t
have to cut anything back to the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Ha! That’s for fucking sure.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What else you got?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Look, Jerr. I’m nothing if not a man of my
word. I’ll drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest. It’s a little
crazed right now. Yeah, on my mother’s eyes, I swear. Thanks, buddy.
Prick. What kinda move you call that?! Lemmings.</p>
<p><strong>talk-radio host</strong>: … it’s a little after 2 am on
December 30th, 1999… the second to last day of the whole darn century,
and the phone lines are open. Dan from Silverlake, you’re on the
air.</p>
<p><strong>dan from silverlake</strong>: Uh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: So Dan, are you looking forward to the New
Year?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not really. I mean what’s the point? Nothing
changes New Years day. The economy sucks, gas is over three bucks a
gallon, fifth grade kids are shooting each other at recess… the whole
thing sucks, right? So what the hell are we celebrating?</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: You’re a glass-is-half-empty kind of guy,
aren’t you Dan? Well I for one happen to think that us making it 2000
years is worth celebrating–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jimbo. I’m there, Jimmy. Right now, can’t you
hear me knockin’?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: – so you line up the talent, shoot the clip,
get it to me by Monday. OK? Client wants a guy and two girls, the guy
wears… yeah, I know, thinks he’s being original. Girls have to be young.
So don’t use your mother like you usually do. Yeah, you too, pendejo.
And no big tits… French tits. That’s it… like Champagne glasses… you got
it. What a pro. Page me.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: If you read the Bible, Mark, you’d know that
there won’t be another thousand years. Right now we are in the Last
Days, as foretold in the book of–</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: The Last Days? You mean the coming of the
Apocalypse, right? The Rapture?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Yes, that’s right. You only have to look at
the signs… there are wars and rumors of wars–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Now just so the rest of us know how much time
is left, when is the Rapture supposed to hit, exactly? Is it midnight
New Year’s Eve?</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern Standard
or what? I mean, what time zone is God in, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I pray for you all.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I just got something in, Bobby, you might
appreciate. A 211 at a Thai joint goes south, and these three scuzzballs
end up in a gun-and-run. It’s a beauty, two thumbs up. Parental
discretion advised. I’m talking it’s the master, not some stepped-on
copy. One of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yo, Skinner. The Skin Man. Red leather. Nice
feminine touch.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: Fuck you, Nero.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Whattya got for me?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy.
Lovemaking in point-of-view. We look down, see OUR BODY, a woman’s body…
our hands moving over the other woman’s torso. The image is dark, a
primal impression. Sound of harsh breathing, rustling sheets.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, I can use this… … but honey you gotta
move your eyes slower next time. It’s too jerky.</p>
<p><strong>skinner</strong>: It was her first time, Lenny. Cut her some
slack.</p>
<p><strong>tight slowmo shots… abstract</strong>: SQUID tapes and money
changing hands. A SQUID tape sliding sensuously into a deck.</p>
<p><strong>news footage</strong>: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their
xenon lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a
futuristic war zone.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Go ahead, caller, you’re on the air.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: My name’s DeWayne, and I got a New Year’s
resolution for the po-lice. Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down with
2-K.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: 2-K? What’s that DeWayne?</p>
<p><strong>dewayne</strong>: 2-K. The big two thousand. Comin tomorrow
night. Out with the old and in wit da new. See for the Man, no new is
good new, what I’m sayin. He like to keep it the way it is. But we going
to take it, make it new, make it our own. History gonna start right
here, right now–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hi, Dave, this is Lenny. Nero. Lenny Nero.
That’s right. Oh, is it late? Sorry. It’s just that I have something
that might be of interest, and since I always call you first– Uh, huh.
Well, what would be a good time? Okay, sure. Catch you then.</p>
<p><strong>eduardo</strong>: Let me get this straight… you gonna pay me
200 bucks to put on a hair net and bang some beautiful babe. I don’t
know, I gotta think about this.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay, let’s get you wired up. I hope this
axle grease you got in your hair doesn’t screw up the squid
receptors.</p>
<p><strong>eduardo</strong>: What’s all this squid shit?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.
SQUID. Got it? There’s gonna be a test.</p>
<p><strong>eduardo</strong>: Hey, fuck you, man.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of
humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig… what I’m putting on your
head… sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it “being wired,” but
there’s no wire. You gotta keep the recorder close… five, six feet away
max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you’re going to
close escrow, know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>eduardo</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Some tips. Don’t dart your eyes around. Don’t
look in the mirror or you’ll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of
tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don’t wait too
long, I don’t want to be going out for popcorn. And don’t act natural.
Don’t act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>eduardo</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: A star is born.</p>
<p><strong>engelman</strong>: She’s a hooker, vice’ll have her in the
book. We can pick her up later.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: No. Now.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Do you request back-up?</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Negative. Suspect is a black male, age 35 to
40. We’re handling it.</p>
<p><strong>engelman</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be there, you
got to help me, come on, pick up, pick up…</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: … you got to be there for me… COME ON! Shit,
I’ll call later.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Hey, you going to watch or you going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Watch and see.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I love your eyes, Lenny. I love the way they
see.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: … bodies of two men found early this
morning under the Hollywood freeway have been identified as rap star
Jeriko One and bandmember James Polton, known to fans as “Replay”. A
third body, that of a woman, has not yet been identified. With his band,
the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko One’s outspoken political stance and
violent lyrics have stirred nationwide controversy…</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A little later. Lenny sucks on the popsicle
while he puts the night’s wardrobe together. This is a ceremony he
observes carefully. Suit laid out on the bed, shirt beneath the jacket.
Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble – well, maybe – tries another –
that’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You know I can get you anything you want,
anytime you want it, just not right now. We’ll hook up at the club
later. Around eleven. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Anything without an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Lenny my man, I think you want to meet a
friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Looks like money to me.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Don’t forget your friends.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: 10 percent, Fabri, like always.</p>
<p><strong>fabri</strong>: Keith, this is Lenny. Guy I was telling you
about. He can get you anything you–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Just a second. Not to be rude, Keith, but I
got to ask, are you a cop?</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: I understand. No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You understand? Attorney! Right? Am I
right?</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tassel shoes. Entertainment law, would be my
guess. Relax. I just like to guess, is all. It’s my job to know people
and what they want… what’s behind their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>fabrizio</strong>: Lenny gives people their heart’s desire.
Ain’t that right, Lenny?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That’s right. My second question I gotta ask,
so we get our bearings here… have you ever jacket in? Have you ever
wiretripped?</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: A virgin brain! Well we’re going to start you
off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time…</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Just what I’ve read. That the technology was
developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire. And now it’s gone
black market. So, uh, do I get the deck from you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I’ll set you up, get you a deck at my cost…
since my thing is the software.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Clips.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That’s right. Clips. Look, I want you to know
what we’re talking about here. This isn’t like TV only better. This is
life. It’s a piece of somebody’s life. Pure and uncut, straight from the
cerebral cortex. You’re there. You’re doing it, seeing it, hearing it…
feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: What kind of things exactly?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever
you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You want to go skiing without leaving your
den, you can. But I’m assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you
fly to Aspen. That’s not what you’re interested in here. It’s about the
stuff you can’t have… right? The forbidden fruit.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Like running into a liquor store with a .357
magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins.
Or… … see that guy, with the drop-dead Philipino girl friend? Wouldn’t
you like to be that guy for twenty minutes? The right twenty minutes. I
can make it happen. And you won’t even tarnish your wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I can get you what you want. You just have to
talk to me. I’m your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the
switchboard of souls. I’m the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the
Subconscious. You say it, you even think it, you can have it. You want a
girl, you want two girls? I don’t know what your thing is or what you’re
curious about… you want a guy? You want to be a girl… see what that
feels like? You want a nun to tie you up? It’s all doable.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Talk to me about costs, here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Listen, before we get into numbers, I want
you to try a taste. I got a deck with me.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: What? Right Here?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Step into my office.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You were just an eighteen year old girl
taking a shower. Are you beginning to see the possibilities here?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Yeah, I’m interested, but can we get
someplace a little less public?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You nervous? Forget it. The cops have more to
worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me–</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t move! That’s it, assume the position you
miserable techno-perv puke.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Beat it fuckwad.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Damnit, Max, I was with a client! You think
that’s funny? To mess with a man’s livelihood? It’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You see the look on that preppy puke’s face?
Fuckin’ pissed in his Topsiders.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay. It was funny. But it cost me money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, amigo, the world’s full of marks. And
nobody knows how to work ’em like you do, pal. You could sell a goddamn
rat’s asshole for a wedding ring! Let me buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Least you can do.</p>
<p><strong>regular</strong>: Yo, Pelcher! Mad Max!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fuckin’ A right I’m mad! I might kill every man
in here. But first I’m buyin’ my buddy here a drink. Hey O’Neal! You
were right, your wife does give good head.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bobbyyyy! Tequila por favor! Double shots. Make
it Tres Generaciones, huh. Nothin’ but the best for my good friend
Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad. Hey, nice
tie.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: D’you always have to dress like a fuckin’
pimp?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: This tie cost more than your entire
wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s not sayin’ much.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s the one thing that stands between me and
the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: To the jungle! Where outa the blue some
shitbird can cap you in the back of the head and ruin your whole
day.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You were lucky, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yup. So darn lucky. I wake up with a .22-short
floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can’t live off of. Good
thing I wasn’t any luckier. Bobby! Another shooter right here!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You seen Faith lately?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Naw. She won’t call me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I
mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you
could ever hope to get, I mean it’s completely and deeply humiliating
that she’s gone, but it’s over, campadre.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks, Max. I’m touched by your concern.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Iris, working her way from the front door,
staying on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and Lenny at
the bar.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me
want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, Iris, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Lenny, I got to talk to you, it’s serious…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened, honey, some john get rough on
you?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I mean talk private. Please, I’m in trouble,
and so is Faith.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There it is, the magic fuckin’ word.</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: Can we go to your car? There’s something you
have to see right away.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: It’s a bad situation… if they get me I know
they’re going to – OH</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hang on, that’s my car–</p>
<p><strong>tow driver</strong>: Not anymore. Belongs to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey wait a second…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Oh, yeah, that’s the answer! Two million
years of human evolution and that’s the best idea you can come up with?
Okay. Look, whattya get to repo a car? Two hundred? Two fifty? I’ll pay
you three fifty, right now. All you gotta do is drop it off the hook and
say you came by, your mark wasn’t here. Simple. Make a few bucks. Do a
good deed. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You got the cash on you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I was going to write you a check, if
that’s–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay, okay, I totally respect that call. I
would want cash. They’ll take my check inside… I can see you’re pressed
for time, just give me two minutes… here keep my watch for
collateral.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s a Rolex. Be right back. Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Hello? Hey Lenny, whatup? Uh huh. Uh huh.
Sure. So what happened to your car this time?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See, if you packed your piece you could’ve made
the guy see sense.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a
fine jacket.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: An ex-cop that doesn’t carry. It’s
embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What’s goin’
on?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Greetings, gents. So let’s hear this week’s
sad story.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: They jerked my wheels, d’you believe it? I
mean it’s outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.
Have you noticed?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No. I haven’t noticed because I make my
payments. So, Max Pelcher, how’s the P.I. business?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sucks.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Bobby, turn that up.</p>
<p><strong>jeriko one</strong>: The LAPD is a military force turned
against its own people. We live in a police state! The mayor and the
city council sit up in their offices with their social programs that
don’t work… they’re rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. But the new
day is coming! Two-K is coming! The day of reckoning is upon us. History
ends and begins again right here! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: To the end of all things! You know how I know
it’s the end of the world? Because everything’s been done, every kind of
music’s been tried, every government’s been tried, every fuckin’
hairstyle. How you gonna make it another thousand years, for
Chrissake?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m telling ya, it’s over. We used it all
up–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Shutup a second!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Hey, isn’t that Tran Vo?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yup. He was Jeriko’s manager. Bummer, Tran!
Lost your golden goose. Couldn’t happen to a nicer guy.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: But I mean isn’t he Faith’s new–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sssssh! Not in front of Lenny. You may trigger
a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The LAPD have said they believe this is a
gang-related incident. Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: We have no facts yet. All we know for sure is
that we have lost a great artist, that a great voice for change is now
silent…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks for giving me a ride. I just have a
few stops, mostly on the west side–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I’d drop you home,
but I’m not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I’ve already pulled
twelve hours today.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on, Mace. This is gonna be a big night.
Can’t you feel it? The energy in the air? There’s money to be made,
dreams to sell.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Sleaze to peddle.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Just a couple of hours. It’ll be fun–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Excuse me. What part of NO don’t you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mace, you’re my friend. I need you. Plus I’ll
give you 25% of what I make tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but
friends don’t have to pay their friends.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Jeez, you’re pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at
the St. James. I’ll take you there, you can get a cab.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mace! You’re a life-saver.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Driving Mr. Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So, what’s up with you? Another busy night
selling porno to wireheads?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No, wrong… I sell experiences. Sex is only
part of it.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Way I look at it, I actually perform a
humanitarian service. I save lives.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay, take some executive… bored with his
life, bored with his wife… he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.
Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he’s got AIDS,
that he’ll infect his wife. And maybe he really does catch
something–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark
end of the street sometime, it’s what we are. But now the risks are outa
line. The streets are a war zone. And sex can kill you. So you slip on
the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, this shit’s illegal.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Define illegal.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail
twice in the last six months.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, but that was for love.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Define love.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Dammit, Lenny, you made me late.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Fumitsu.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero,
Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine
driver evaluation. We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as
yourself, are always treated as honored guests. I just need to ride up
front and take some notes, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Um, excuse me. Sir. Excuse me. Mr. Nero.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You will not live to see the morning.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Nero.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Strickland.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Commissioner Strickland.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Sure. Whatever. See, since you shitcanned my
career, I don’t even have to call you sir. One of life’s small
pleasures.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Aren’t you peddling your wares a little
far from your usual gutter?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I was invited here by a close friend,
Mr. Fumitsu, see he’s right over there.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: I don’t like disappointments, Nero. And
do you know what disappoints me very much?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Your sex life?</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Your existence.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Now listen to me… you have to get to bed young
man. I mean it. No watching “Tales from the Crypt”. I don’t care what
Cecile says. I’ll see you in the morning, baby. Night, night.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Are we having a bad night?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Let’s talk in the car.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I feel like you’re turning me into a</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I just want to see what we’re like together
through your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I don’t feel anything. Is it on?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Forget it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Make me forget it, baby.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, careful on the jacket. This is Armani.
You angry?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’ve had enough of this shit. You’re on foot,
Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: In LA? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Can I come in please? I’m having a hard time
hearing the stereo.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I need my case. It’s still in the back.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Listen, can we talk a little bit here, like
two rational adults?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That would be no.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’ve had it. No more wirehead shit in my car.
You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay, you got my attention, but this is
cutting off the circulation to my head, here. D’you mind?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I thought we were friends.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No, see a friend is more than one person
constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with
your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I’m out. I got a
kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn’t send me a
dime of support… I’m just trying to hold on here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So am I. Just trying to get by.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No, you’re just trying to get off.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Macey… I’ve never seen you like this.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, you’re turning into some kinda
squid-head low-life. You’re always broke, you just go from one score to
the next. And you’re getting strung out… you don’t even see it. Getting
high on your own supply like some crack dealer.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I know you wouldn’t be saying all this if you
didn’t care about me. Thanks, Mace. Really.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Look, I gotta get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You still like me, don’t you? We’re still
buddies?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah. I don’t see a way out of it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Macey, I know you’re tired, but can you drop
me at the Retinal Fetish? It’s on your way.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Jesus, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Begging? Groveling? Any pathetic behavior at
all? Will that help? Faith’s there tonight, and I’ve got to talk to
her.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a
junkie is someone in love.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on, let me buy you a drink. Let’s drink
and make up. Alright, I’m going to see Faith. That means you can watch
me suffer. I’ll be in agony, you’ll feel so much better. Total and
thorough payback, whatdya say?</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Lenny watches a man at the table
holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Who’s the new side of beef in Tran’s
posse?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running
back for the Rams in ’96 and ’97.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Rams… that’s football, right?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Forget her.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She still loves me.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: She thinks you’re a bucket of dog vomit. Trust
me on this.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She’s my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial?
She’s a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a
better ride.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny? For
old time’s sake? Make a couple bucks for the holidays?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You’re not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn’t
sell you the sweat off a dead dog’s balls.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: I already got everything I need from you.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Cut it out, Tran.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough
break.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Show a little respect, Nero. The man was an
important artist.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, important for your label. Which no
doubt is why you’re in mourning. Don’t worry, his records’ll sell out
now he’s dead. You’ll make out.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: I always do.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Faith, can I talk to you a second?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good idea, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I just got to talk to you for one second.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That would be between me and Faith, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: I don’t feel anything between you. See, your
trouble is you assume too much, Lenny. You assume there’s something
where there’s nothing. You assume you have a life. But you’re only
hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your
own.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his
car.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Faith, call me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: No, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tick, listen, I can’t stop right now. but
I’ll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Lenny the loser. Panhandler of stolen
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Leave him alone, Tran.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: He’s no concern of mine, as long as you don’t
talk to him. Don’t talk to anybody. You understand? Not with everything
that’s going on right now.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You’re too goddamned paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Paranoia’s only reality on a finer scale.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So, those rascals still haven’t grown back
yet, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Nope. Guess not. Any day now, though.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Present. Something I had made. Let me know
what you think.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Hey, alright. Got something here for you, too.
It just showed up tonight, don’t know who left it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Fan mail from some flounder?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hi, baby. I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to
me he’ll hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I’m already hurting.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You have to go. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one
question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You talked to Iris? When?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Well I haven’t seen her in months. Who knows
what’s going on in her head. You’re really running out of excuses to
come around, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I know you Faith. You’re afraid of something.
What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Let it alone, Lenny. It’ll take care of
itself.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s Tran, isn’t it? This guy is poison,
Faith. Listen to me. He’s got you walled in on all sides. And he uses
the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: That’s a good one, coming from you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Why don’t you just split? You don’t love him,
anybody can see that. And to him you’re just some kinda possession, like
a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: He has his uses too.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What? He gonna record you on his label?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on, Faith! He’s just toying with you.
And when he gets bored, you’ll be yesterday’s papers.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Look, baby, I’ve watched you create yourself
out of nothing. You’re like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making
it. And you will.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Damn right.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s you up on that stage, not him. You don’t
need him.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You have to get out of here. If Tran catches
you he’ll… he’s acting crazy. He’s doing way too much playback and he’s
getting completely paranoid. He’s such a control freak, he’s even paying
Max to follow me around.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Max Pelcher? You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay
away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over. I’m a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay,
because I don’t need saving… Just… give up on me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You know one of the ways movies still have
Squid beat? Because they always say “The End.” You always know when it’s
over. It’s over! Now please leave. I have to go on again in a couple of
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Hell.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Shoulda told me about your new gig,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it’s just a job. I
feel like shit about it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You should feel like shit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I figured, what the hell, I could take the
prick’s money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both
good. Right?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey,
at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m on her.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful
come-along hold and hustling him toward the back of the club.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Can I get that?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I think
Tran’s got Beemer looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: Lenny, as he’s hustled out the rear
door.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I recognize you. You’re Wade Beemer. Running
back for the Rams, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>beemer</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a
fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or
what?</p>
<p><strong>beemer</strong>: Bullshit politics.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s always politics. Like this thing we’re
in here, he’s paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more
not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now–</p>
<p><strong>beemer</strong>: Come on, let’s go, I got to get back.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay cash! Logical. Here’s everything I have
on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?</p>
<p><strong>beemer</strong>: I already got a real one. Come on, it won’t
be too bad. It’s not personal.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Just not the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: They oughta get some lights back there. A
person could get killed slipping on those stairs. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: an eerie NIGHT VISION SHOT of Mace and Lenny
getting into the limo. Then we see: Spreg and Engelman, the two street
Hun cops. Watching.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You’re some piece of work, you know that. Just
calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never
let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation
you’re in now, you must’ve seen it all.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I have crawled through the gutter… through
every wrinkle in the human brain.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What I’m saying. But you still come out this
goofball romantic.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It is my sword and my shield, Macey.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What’s that? Present from Faith?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p><strong>pov sequence</strong>: the first thing we notice is that the
POV is distorted visually. The colors are de-saturated. Almost black and
white. Yet the detail is crisp and clear, almost hyper-real.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s a test pattern so far.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Alright, a little B&amp;E action.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, getting good. Solid suspense build.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Go to the Sunset Sheraton. RIGHT NOW! Just
go! GO!</p>
<p><strong>iris</strong>: I haven’t seen your face… I haven’t heard your
voice… you can still let me go…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Holy shit. He’s jacking her in to his own
output. She’s seeing what he’s seeing. She’s seeing herself.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: On my God. Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: My God, Lenny. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Black. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Blackjack? I don’t understand–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Snuff clip. It was Iris. She said she needed
my help and I… aw Jesus, Mace… the sick fucker killed her.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Are you sure it’s real?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ohhhh shit.</p>
<p><strong>time cut</strong>: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace’s
Lincoln, has his head propped in his hands. His eyes are distant…
replaying. Still shocked to his soul. Mace paces nearby.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well… I’ve lost my appetite. For about a
year.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You alright? Y’okay?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah. No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let’s work it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Not now… I don’t want to think about it–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, Lenny. You used to be good at this
stuff. Play it down. What’s the perp doing?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He stalks her. He rapes her. Then he does
her…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And he records it. Thrill kill. Wants to see it
again. And again.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He records himself raping and killing
her–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But at the same time he’s sending the signal to
her–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So she feels… what he feels… while he’s in
her. The thrill while he’s killing her… is sent to her, heightening her
fear… which in turn heightens the turn on for him. I’ve seen a lot,
Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So’ve I. Too much.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: But this is a bad one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Top ten.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He makes her see her own death, feeds off the
reaction… killer and victim merging… orgasm and agony merging. And he
records it all.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: And gives it to you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Wants to share.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s right. He wants to share. Needs an
audience. This is one sick puppy.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Cause you’re the man, right? The Magic Man. If
it’s got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on
your beach.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I’ve never dealt in black-jacks. Never.
Everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s skull-fucking you, bud. Trying to get a
reaction. Maybe pushing you to do something.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate
what he’s created. It’s the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you
like it now?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jesus, Mace. Back off.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: This guy is someone you know, one of your
squid-head contacts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Take the tape to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Uh unh. No way! They’d crucify me.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running
around–</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Naw, he’s right. They’ll figure Lenny’s the
perp, or go through his client list, ruin his life… such as it is. Look,
I’ll call the guys in Homicide… tell them she was a friend of mine and
they’ll keep me in the loop. Get me the forensics and all that. Get some
sleep. I’ll call you when I get something. And Lenny… I’d keep moving if
I were you.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You’re crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming
here… Tran’s just in there.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Iris is dead. She was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Who did it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Don’t know. But this guy’s real damaged
goods. Iris knew someone was after her… and she said you were in danger
too. Now no more games, Faith. Whatever you’re hiding, whatever’s going
on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now. Don’t even
think about it.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to
protect me? Big tough guy. You’re a talker, Lenny. You don’t even have a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I have a gun. It’s under my bed.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You don’t know what you’re fucking with
here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Go ahead, Faith. Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Look, Tran… Lenny just came by to give me
some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember
Iris?</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: A tragic story, no doubt. How’d you get up
here?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Charm.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Uh huh. Look, Nero. I’ll make you an offer.
Take her. Right now. If she wants to go, if she’s unhappy here, she can
go. I’ll let her choose. Faith always knows what she wants. Hands off.
See?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s alright. He means it.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: I do mean it. And I mean this… if Faith stays
you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach
hole and never cross my vision again. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I made my choice, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: You’re going down.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I don’t love you, Lenny. Give up.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You said you were going to get her out of
this.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Maybe now you appreciate the danger we’re in.
It was touching the way you stood by me in there. “Stand by your man”. I
was moved. You were very good. I don’t think he even understands that
you did it for him.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: He doesn’t know what’s going on. Leave him
alone.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: I’d love to. But he keeps showing up. And you
keep talking to him. I can’t have that–</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: The only time a whore should open her mouth is
when she’s giving head.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Listen, can we be smart here? I could make it
really worth your while… I could cut you a check for 500 each… hell,
make it an even grand… I’m not saying you don’t land a couple shots,
just go light is all I’m saying… here, take my Rolex.</p>
<p><strong>corto</strong>: Lemme see.</p>
<p><strong>corto</strong>: We tried to find a smaller girl, to beat the
shit out of you, Lenny… but it was short notice.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Safety’s on.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Is this great fabric or what?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Never really thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on… look in the mirror. You know it’s
there, you’re keeping your eyes off it, you bastard… SHIT! Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace
near him.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He knows what he’s doing. He’s worn before… a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So that gives you something.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It gives me… I don’t know… maybe two hundred
people who I know wear.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Don’t crank the gain any more. You’re gonna
fry yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I need to see more… get more detail.
Something. I feel his presence, so strong…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No more, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah. I’m ghosting pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She came to me for help. I should have read
it better… I just figured, y’know… another strung- out hooker having a
bad night.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Sex killers act alone. So there’s no
information on the street, which is how cases get made. Cops know
they’ll never nail this guy the second they look at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: And anyway, nobody gives a shit about a dead
hooker. They’re roadkill.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: See, it’s all about what they see walking in.
A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration… they’ll see a trick gone wrong.
Random kill. The kind you never solve.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: But that doesn’t add, does it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Because Iris knew somebody was after her.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She said “If they get me”. They. Which means
the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her
for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So the guy’s not a sicko.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: If he could do what’s on that tape, he’s a
sicko.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Okay, so he’s a freak who thinks he’s sane
pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted
to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Because it had to look random. Not connected
to anything or anyone. But then why give the rape to me?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: That’s where it gets a little strange.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: And what about the guy that was following
me?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Now you’re really getting paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: The question is not whether I am paranoid,
but whether I am paranoid enough. You want to rub my neck?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: How’s Zander?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: OK. He asks about you all the time. It’s been
weeks since you’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’m sorry about getting on your case earlier.
I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I – anyway. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: S’okay. I know you still love me.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Where were you Mom? Did you meet a guy?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Just Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Right. That explains it.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Are you going to make me beg?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Cheerios and wieners. I made it myself. It’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Well give me some then… I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it
in bed.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: W’sup, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Not a whole hell of a lot. They’ve just been
saying words over Jeriko. Tensions running pretty high down here. I’m
telling you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Faith OK?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. She’s leaving with Tran so I got to
boogie. Real quick… Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a
false name. Paid cash.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Looks like she was holding out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yup. Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran
last night. Another slick Lenny move.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He’s in this somehow… I don’t know how. Just
stay close to Faith.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m on her, amigo. No worries. Gotta jam.</p>
<p><strong>pov sequence</strong>: DAY. As expected we see the
de-saturated signature look of the killer’s vision. The Wearer is
walking through the courtyard of Lenny’s apartment building. We
recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken deck furniture. We walk
through a breezeway to an ally- like courtyard behind the building. We
approach a door… the back door to Lenny’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Whatup Lenny?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jesus, Mace!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Anywhere. We’ll talk about it in the car.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hand me that box of tapes, will you?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: This tie doesn’t go with blue!</p>
<p><strong>poor man</strong>: … the New Years Eve mega-bash of the
century. Ten square blocks of madness, with live music, fireworks and
the actual rich and famous of LA hobnobbing with us peons. Also yours
truly the Poor Man will be there at the KROQ bandshell, giving away
“Millennium LA” and “KROQ 2-K” T-shirts by the truckload–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Will you relax. There’s nobody back there.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mace, the guy had a knife. To my throat. In
my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You better keep a low profile for a while.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No shit. You got someplace in mind?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Today I have…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, have you lost it completely?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Easy, there, Mom. Easy. This is audio only.
John Coltrane. “A Love Supreme.” Give it a listen, let me know what you
think, maybe you won’t go for it now, but it’ll get in your head and
grow like a seed into something really beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Let’s play it now!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Later. Your mom’n I are heading right back
out.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a full 24
hours, I have to get ready for the party tonight…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Cecile.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You’re not the only little boy I have to look
out for, honey.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: squid tape of Iris’ death. Quick barrages of
the savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static…</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Whoa. That is one unbelievable piece of
eyefuck.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you
tell me about the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Well… the guy’s fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We know that, Tick.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: No, I mean the killer’s got some kind of
distortion in his visual cortex. The color and gray-scale values are all
messed up, like color blindness.</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?
Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of
trauma This is not good. I don’t like this at all…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Well, it’s cutting awful close to me. I mean
she was just here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Who was just here?</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Iris, man. Pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Wait, wait… wait a minute. Iris was
here?!</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a
junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What clip? What was it?</p>
<p><strong>tick</strong>: I don’t know, man, she wouldn’t let me see it.
Said I wouldn’t want to see it. She said she was going to give it to you
to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin’</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She never gave me a tape.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Think back about what she said. Exactly what
she said.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She wanted to go out to my car, something
about my car…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Something in your car…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That’s a handy little attitude adjuster.
Damn. I’m boxed in.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Nothing. Let’s go play this back.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Give me the tape. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What tape? I’m just trying to get my car back
but the place is closed–</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Shut the fuck up Nero.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, give them the tape.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s in my case. Okay? I’m going to open my
case…</p>
<p><strong>engelman</strong>: Facing us, where we can see it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Take it and turn her loose. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Oh no, we’re not being followed, Lenny, Don’t
be so paranoid, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Take it easy. The glass is bullet
resistant.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Bullet resistant? Whatever happened to bullet
proof?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Goddamnit!! 911 is busy!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: It’s okay, Lenny They’d never get here in time
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: The gas tank’s going to go any second!</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down,
sitting there amid the junk. Shafts of light play down from the big
streetlights at the end of the pier.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Are you out of your fucking mind?!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Fire’s out, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Get in here. Come on Lenny, move it.
MOVE!!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Get ready to hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, kick out hard, then just follow me.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>on the surface</strong>: Mace breaks the surface slowly
alongside the slimy concrete wall. Lenny comes up beside her,
spluttering. Her hand goes over his mouth. They are in the inky shadows
under a massive bumper made of rail-road ties.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I can’t believe we had to give them the damn
tape.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, me neither. It was one of my favorites.
Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday. I’m going to really miss
it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Are we impressed yet?</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: I got better things to do on New Year’s Eve
than be some kinda damn chauffeur…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Hey Curtis? Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Those two guys were cops.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s the walk. Something. Anyway, they’ll run
your plates and get your address. We gotta keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Lornette, girl… what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: We’re going to aunt Cecile’s, honey. We’re
going to watch fireworks from there. Let’s go. Chop chop.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Aw, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on Zander. You can ride on my shoulders.
Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Cecile, get in the car. Now.</p>
<p><strong>one of the boys</strong>: Yo, Mace. Whatup wit you, homegirl?
You never come roun’ here no more.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: He’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I can’t tell you. You’ve got to see.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Uh unh. I won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mace. I know what you think about the wire.
But I’m asking you to do this. It’s that important.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Sorry this has to be your first playback.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Keep your eyes closed, or you’ll see
double.</p>
<p><strong>pov sequence</strong>: We are Iris. Riding in a car. Fixing
our makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor. Iris flips the
sun visor back up, revealing the moving street. It is night.</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: Shit. Fuckin’ Five-O</p>
<p><strong>cop voice</strong>: Go to the bottom of the ramp.</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: Goddamn, now what you pull me over for? If I
was going any slower I’d be parked–</p>
<p><strong>cop voice 1</strong>: Get down on your knees and put your
hands on your head. Now!</p>
<p><strong>cop voice 2</strong>: Everyone else, out of the car and down
on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>cop voice 1</strong>: Put your hands behind your head right
now!</p>
<p><strong>engelman</strong>: Put your hands on the hood of the car and
don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: I suppose you stopped us cause you had
suspects fitting our description in the area, what you’re gonna tell me.
What was the description? Two black males in a car? Yeah, right, I heard
that one before…</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: Well you stopped the wrong black male
tonight officer… what is it? Spreg. Officer Spreg. Cause I’m the 800
pound gorilla in your mist, fucker. I make more in a day than you make
in a year, and my lawyers love to spend my money dragging sorry-ass
Aryan robocops like you into court. Get a man down on the ground with no
probable cause. Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>diamanda</strong>: Leave the fuck off of us, we weren’t doing
anything…</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Shut up! Don’t make me walk over there.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: You’re that rap puke? Jeriko One? You’re the
one getting all the gangbangers to form citizens groups and go downtown…
trying to rake the LAPD over a cheese grater?</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: That’s right. And you’re gonna be in my next
song, motherfucker, it’s called Robo-Spreg.</p>
<p><strong>jeriko</strong>: It’s a song about a cop who meets his worst
nightmare, a nigger with enough political juice to crush his ass like a
stink bug. You’re gonna be famous.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Hey… I don’t hear you laughing!</p>
<p><strong>spreg</strong>: Get the bitches.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hang on. Hang on, Max. You see?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I see. I see the earth opening up and
swallowing us all.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah I know. So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t talk to anybody. Anybody. You’re
invisible. Okay? Just meet me at Tick’s in a half hour. And Lenny… don’t
get pulled over.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: We got to make another copy of this. Little
life insurance.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You know what this tape could do if it gets
out.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I’ve got a good idea, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: People finding out… seeing… that the LAPD just
flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Maybe. But tonight is probably not the best
night. Come on, we’re rollin’.</p>
<p><strong>cecile</strong>: Lornette, when you gonna stop laying off
everything on me? We had plans tonight–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Listen to me, little sister. There’s something
going on, and it’s very big. Now you’ve got to take care of Zander. And
stay off the streets tonight… you hear me on this?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Curtis. What about you? Do we understand each
other? You stay put.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Yeah. I’m wit it.</p>
<p><strong>curtis</strong>: Damn! She worse than you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So, let’s see, I’ve got Tran’s goons, some
squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me. Happy new year,
Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Well, look at the plus side.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: There’s a plus side?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save
me. That’s real progress for you.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It was a tough call.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I still can’t square the psycho smarts of
whoever did Iris with those two cops.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I don’t think those cops did Iris. I think
whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: To break the trail. If those cops had gotten
hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for,
and then gone after them too. Our killer is running as scared as we are.
Which makes him really dangerous. Judging by how scared I am.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sounds like Tick’s already celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You may be a little overdressed for this
party. Yo, Tick! It’s Lenny. Open up!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Tick, I got to talk to you, man… oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He’s been cooked-off</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No. But his frontal lobes are like two runny
eggs. They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it
french-fried his brain.</p>
<p><strong>tick’s pov</strong>: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate
static. Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny’s face,
almost invisible. We hear the tiniest ghost of his voice, like a radio
playing two blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: He’s totally cut off from the outer
world.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: How long does it last? Oh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn
to find the tape and cover their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: This seems a little sophisticated for them.
These are not subtle guys.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s more to this whole thing than you
think.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Whattya mean?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All I’m saying… you don’t know how high up the
food chain this thing goes. I’ve heard stuff.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What stuff?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Smoke. Rumors. I’ve heard stuff about a death
squad. A group a guys loyal to the hardline school. Guys that’ve had too
many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media
pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their
hands… while outa the other side a their mouths these same people’re
squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is
totally out of control.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. So don’t walk near me in public,
alright.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Thanks, buddy. See… things weren’t bad
enough. They weren’t fucking bad enough!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: The only card we have to play is the tape. You
know, we get it to the media somehow…</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, right, blow it open.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mace… no disrespect… but you run this on the 11
o’clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history. They’ll
see the fucking smoke from Canada.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay… what about Strickland?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. Bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Who’s Strickland?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland. The
sanctimonious prick who busted me out. His ass is so tight when he farts
only dogs can hear it. I know this guy. If there’s one cop who’s not
dirty it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Listen to me, Lenny… stay away from cops. All
cops. You have no way of knowing who you can trust.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: So you’re saying we just pretend is didn’t
happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black
men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fine. Do you want blood running waist deep in
the storm drains? The gangbangers’ll spread like a wave through this
city and burn it to the ground. And when the fires start the street
cops’ll be capping off at anything that moves. It’ll be all- out war and
you know it.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah, well maybe it’s time for a war!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You really want that on your head?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, Max, Mace… whoa… time out.</p>
<p><strong>max/mace</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Whoever killed Iris did Tick. It’s the same
sick wirehead shit. Same reason… to burn the trail. If Faith knows
anything about this, and I think she does, then she’s on the list. So…
who’s driving?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Lenny! Jesus! You scared the Hell out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Faith, we know about Jeriko. Iris made me a
copy of the tape.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out
of this.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: How did it happen? What was Iris doing riding
around with Jeriko wearing a wire?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: We should talk alone.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No. Mace is in this.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Tell us.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Tran’s gotten obsesses with playback, a total
wiretrip junkie. And he’s such a control freak, he’s been having people
followed, videotaped… recording his business partners’ calls. Wiring up
people left and right.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Let’s go get her. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tran, listen. I was wondering how you want me
to work it tonight, down at the Bonaventure. You want me downstairs at
the party or upstairs at the suite? Where you going to be, mostly?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Tran and Jeriko weren’t getting along. He was
afraid Jeriko was getting ready to dump him, but he wasn’t sure, so he
started with the surveillance. A couple nights ago he wires up Iris and
sends her and the other girl, Diamanda, over to Jeriko’s table.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves
Tran’s table with Diamanda and moves toward… a booth in the Retinal
Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay. Iris stands over Jeriko for
just a moment. Then he nods, smiles a little, and moves over to make
room for her in the booth right next to him.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: That night Iris calls up, freaking. She comes
over and Tran watches the tape. He just loses it. He can’t believe the
disaster she’s gotten him into. He’s terrified the cops will beat it out
of her who she was working for, and come looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: TRAN’S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic
Iris is telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her . Tran
backhands her furiously, his face thin- lipped with rage. She crumples
to the floor, sobbing. Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand
like it’s poison.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Why didn’t he just go public with the tape?
Save himself that way.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: An image of Tran burning the squid tape. It
blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like a venomous
snake.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: The scandal would wipe him out. If it got out
that he had his own artists under surveillance… he’d lose all his other
acts. He’d be over.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells
her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what
to do.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah… he figured out what to do all
right.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You think Tran killed her?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: The killer knew right where she was. Because
he put her there.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: What a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Go get her, Joey. Stupid bitch. We’ll talk
about this later.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Come on. We’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Leave here with me, right now.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Okay, Lenny. My guardian angel.</p>
<p><strong>tex</strong>: Teach you… to mess with… a helpless
cripple!</p>
<p><strong>corto</strong>: Not here. Lets go.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Everything’s cool. Too much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah, uh… he slipped on the stairs. We’re
taking him to emergency. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Go to Cedars. It’s closest.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Well, I’m certainly in the mood for a
party.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: Take her up to the suite. Have a glass of
champagne… or six… I’ll be up in a while to help you ring in the New
Year.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I live for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
motherfucker, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Owww!! Take it easy. Uh huh. So where are
they now?</p>
<p><strong>max’s pov</strong>: through a dense throng of glitterati we
see Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court with music
types and politicos.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s got her up in the room, under guard. And
he’s still working the party… acting smooth like nothin’s nothin’. So
buddy… I say we work a trade.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Give him the tape. See? It’s fucking brilliant!
The tape for Faith. I know he’ll go for it. I can set it up.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: This is what we laughingly refer to as a
plan, right?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on! If he gives us any shit, we kill ‘em
all. Whattya say? Just get your butt down here. If I’m not at the
shindig downstairs go to the room. It’s 2203. You writin’?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: 2-2-0-3. Got it. Stay on her.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Okay, we gotta get over there. Can you borrow
a dress from Cecile or something–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I’m not going.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Whatya mean? We’re going! Tran’s gonna do her
right there unless–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny… shutup. Just park your mouth and
listen. It’s a set-up. Think about it! Why’s he been sending you tapes?
To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in
you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand… crime of passion. This
guy’s bent enough to think of that.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: That sounds right. I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You gonna get yourself killed for this? This
toxic-waste bitch!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny! This is your life, Lenny! Right here.
Right now. This is realtime… not playback. Real… time. Time to get real.
Understand what I’m saying… she doesn’t love you. Maybe she did once, I
don’t know, but she doesn’t now. These are used emotions. It’s time to
trade them in.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Lenny, memories were meant to fade. They’re
designed that way for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Have you ever been in love with somebody who
didn’t return that love?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah. Lenny. I have.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It didn’t stop you from loving them. Right?
Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: And it didn’t stop you from wanting to
protect them. Did it?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No. It didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I worked Vice, Narcotics… Violent Crimes… and
I saw every known depravity. I was lost, Mace. In outer darkness. Then I
busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was
just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank. Another
lost soul.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: You never told me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: But she was different. There was a light in
her eyes… and she had this voice. It was scary, all that pain coming out
of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the
entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice. I helped her. And I
promised her that I’d always be there… to protect her. See? It’s not
about what’s in her head. It’s what’s in mine. I can’t let go of the
promise. It’s… like… it’s all I have left.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Come on, Lenny. Let’s go to a party.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: That’s it. Let’s bail.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Mace… you’re a girl.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig
didn’t work out. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Got your ticket?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: No. They must have sent it to my beach house
by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: It is SPREG. His black eyes scan the
crowd.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You see Tran?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Uh unh.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Come on, Max. Come on, buddy… Damnit.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Alright. We’re going up.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: And do what? Take on his whole posse?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I still got one ace to play. Tran’s got what
I want… and I’ve got what he wants…</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: That’s the original. There are no copies.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Exactly. That’s why it’s a make- able
deal.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Look. That tape is a lightning bolt from God.
It’s worth more than you, more than me, more than Faith. You understand?
It can change things. Things that need changing before we all go off the
end of the road. And you do not have the right to use it for currency.
You go… you go alone. This is where I draw the line. I care about you
Lenny… a lot more than you know… which makes us both pretty stupid. But
you pawn that tape, you mean nothing to me.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Ah, hell. Lenny–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: See that guy? The one with the ramrod up his
ass. That’s Strickland.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Take it to him.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Oh boy. What if you’re wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Then we’ll be right where we are now.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah, right. Fucked.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: There’s a tape in there you need to see. I
mean right now.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: If it wasn’t New Year’s Eve, I’d arrest
you for possession of illegal equipment–</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Just look at the tape! You want to know who
killed Jeriko One? Go in the stall right now and hit Play.</p>
<p><strong>young cop</strong>: Sir, is there a problem here?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Damn! I knew it–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Now, Wade, can we talk here, like two human
beings–</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: It’s not personal.</p>
<p><strong>corto</strong>: Aw, not the fucking nose!!</p>
<p><strong>vita</strong>: Hey, enjoy the party.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Oh. I didn’t hear you come in.</p>
<p><strong>the recording restarts</strong>: A new image resolves out of
static. Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed. We climb onto the bed,
straddling her, and she gasps. We turn her onto her back.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>tran</strong>: You’re going to die, you’re both going to
fucking die.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.
Do you believe that? Isn’t that right, Tran? You pinhead.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Oh my God. I don’t believe this is
happening.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Believe it. Now bring me the trodes, baby. Come
on, quick.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: What’re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: You can’t just… kill him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not. Just a little poach job.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, he was going to kill you. And this ratfuck
paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You shut the fuck up, right now, I’m gonna pull
this fuckin’ trigger!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, baby, it’s now of never… the guy is a
known input junkie, so a little OD won’t surprise anybody. It’s the only
way we can be together. You know it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here’s how much I love you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t make any assumptions about our
friendship, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: No. I suppose not. I didn’t know you were
colorblind, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only way I could stand your ties.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll have that. Glock 22. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Where’s Faith?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I sent her to the party. I figured I’d wait up
here until you killed Tran.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What makes you think I’m gonna kill Tran?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You just did.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know, statistically that’s the second most
common word people say right before they die. Shit being number one.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So… I killed Tran. Then you ran in, being on
his payroll, and shot me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s pretty much the way it happened.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Wait a minute. Now I’m remembering. I killed
Iris too, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s right. They’ll find the original of her
snuff clip in your apartment. The one I left for you at the club was a
copy.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Was I a really busy guy? Did I do Tick
too?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You bet. Did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So why Max… why d’ya have to do Iris? She
never hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Picture it… I feel like I gotta share this with
somebody. It’s too perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: I won’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know. So, I’m working for this puke, right?
And he says he’ll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta
do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she’s
totally out of control.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Only he doesn’t know about me and Faith. So I
say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I
lose Faith… to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still
gotta do something about Tran… I figure it’s him or me… but I can’t cap
him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his
girlfriend’s loser ex-boyfriend… a known criminal… who has been seen
hassling them in public numerous times.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: And who was, regrettably, also your best
fucking friend.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up.
World’s gonna end in ten minutes anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You must be so pleased, I followed your
jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You got froggy on me a couple times.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been
cooked-off. We see Max running his number on Mace and Lenny. Lenny
buying it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I thought that riff about the Death Squad was
pretty good. I hadda keep you from bringing the cops into it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: So there never was a death squad.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Naawww.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Just those two loose-cannon cops running
around covering their butts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. Pretty zany, huh? All this shit caused by
a random traffic stop. Hey… nothing means nothing. You know that. Look
around… the whole planet’s in total chaos. You gotta take what you can,
while you can. Cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin’ .22 in
the back a your head any second.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape:
Spreg shoots Jeriko.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: How did you hook up with Faith?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her,
right? But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and
says, ‘Hey Max why you following me?’ I say, ‘I’ll buy you a drink and
explain.’ And she says…</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: ‘So, do you enjoy watching me?’</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: I know. I don’t always do exactly what I’m
told. So I said, ‘Do you enjoy watching me?’ And you said – come on
Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I said, ‘Yeah. I’d even do it for free.’</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Uh huh. And I said, ‘That’s good, because I
like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from
Lenny.’</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And then she said, ‘Since we’re going to be
spending so much time together–’</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: ‘We might as well make the best of it.’</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Jesus, Faith.</p>
<p><strong>faith</strong>: Lenny!!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fucking bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: All the way down! RIGHT NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Wait. Let me tell you what’s going on
here–</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: These two are under arrest for
murder.</p>
<p><strong>strickland</strong>: Get some medical attention for this
woman.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: I got ’em, Lenny.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Are we under arrest?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Naw. They just have to ask us a few
questions… for about six hours.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Hey, Lenny. We made it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah. We did.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Well… Get going. You’re still bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: See you downtown.</p>
<p><strong>mace</strong>: Yeah. See you there.</p>
