<p><strong>original screenplay</strong>: By</p>
<p><strong>joan o’brien</strong>: And</p>
<p><strong>charles denton</strong>: Based on a Story Idea by</p>
<p><strong>joan o’brien</strong>: Additional Material by Jerry Lewis</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: Coffee? It’s nice and hot.</p>
<p><strong>midget</strong>: 15 Minutes to circus… 15 minutes to
circus.</p>
<p><strong>ringmaster</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we proudly
present… “The Clowns”!</p>
<p><strong>mr schmidt</strong>: Not to mention how unprofessional that
was…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But it was an accident…</p>
<p><strong>gustav</strong>: Oh, sure it was… A very well planned and
calculated accident!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I swear to you… it was an accident!</p>
<p><strong>gustav</strong>: I don’t want to hear any more… You will get
me another stooge. I don’t want this man!!</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Don’t get excited, Gustav, you shall have
it.</p>
<p><strong>gustav</strong>: You bet I will, or you shall have no
show.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: trunk, leaning over You will run with the
other clowns and that’s all you will do… is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: And if there is another one of your cute
tricks… I promise you will do your bits for the “Cats” while cleaning
their cages!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Clause… give me a double whiskey with beer
chaser.</p>
<p><strong>clause</strong>: You won’t get “Funny” out of a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: And you won’t make a dime sticking your nose
in other people’s business.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Helmut, darling, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Do I look like I’m not all right?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I was so worried about you… Your dinner is cold
and I couldn’t imagine what happened to you…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Were you really worried about me or your
stupid dinner was getting cold?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Sweetheart, I care about you… I love you… I
worry about you… I can’t help those feelings…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If there is anything I don’t need right now…
it’s your super- sentimentality…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Helmut… what’s tormenting your soul? Please let
me help you… talk to me… I don’t care what it is… I love you… I’m your
friend… you can trust me to understand…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I can’t trust anybody… I don’t know how to
trust anybody…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: I’m not anybody! I’m your wife!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m sorry, my love… I’m so sorry… You’re
right! You’re not anybody. You’re my wife and I love you, too… So very
much I just have no one to fight back at… I’m lost and alone, I can’t
handle the disgrace of failure… the pain of being a has- been is more
than I can bear…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Schmidt again? Gustav again? When will you
learn they fear you and they know how vulnerable you are now… if they
can beat you down then they needn’t worry about you coming back to haunt
them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They worry about me? Don’t be ridiculous…
they just took the last comic bit away from me… because of a silly
accident… I’m now down at the bottom, just a stooge assisting a
not-so-funny clown.</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: But they can’t take your talent away… That’s
your strongest force!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What the hell are you talking about? What
talent? And if I had any it’s being suffocated into nothing… And that’s
just what I am now… nothing… No one… just empty… a prop to be used and
mis-used… how does my great talent stand up to those odds?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: By not quitting… You must fight! Creative
survival is even more difficult than human survival… You must
fight!!!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Go to Schmidt… Force a confrontation… Don’t let
Gustav win… make Schmidt see what an injustice they are imposing on you…
Please, my love, fight! Make your world better by fighting for it… You
can do it… I know you can…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I will go now and see Schmidt… I will tell
him I won’t take any more degradation… I will tell him I am a “clown”
not a stooge… A “clown”… A special person… A special clown…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Go, my love… Go and fight for what you know is
right… I will warm your dinner and wait for you to come home.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Naturally, I agree… Doork is a nuisance,
but to just let him go seems a little unfair.</p>
<p><strong>gustav</strong>: Schmidt! Don’t make me put it on a “either
him or me basis”.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: All right… all right… I’ll give him –</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: – his two weeks notice tomorrow. Will that
satisfy you?</p>
<p><strong>gustav</strong>: Perfectly!! Let’s have a drink…</p>
<p><strong>clause</strong>: It’s your funeral.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: A funeral is usually in order when someone
dies.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: The trouble with man today is that he takes
everything for granted… he thinks things he’s told to think… and accepts
it! Just because we know meanings of words we use them and we fool
ourselves… people should use the dictionary more… look up words like
good… bad… honest… loyal… especially loyal, I know what loyal means, and
I have always been that… but does anyone care? No! Of course not… Only
when it is expedient… When it isn’t — — ZIPPPP! You’re out!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: And that goes for you too… Mine Fuhrer…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: … you, too, are a fool. You allow yourself
to think you have “loyal” followers… Ha! Wait until they’ve had it with
you… You’ll get yours… all the smiling, bowing, heel clicking idiots
will shaft you too. And you will deserve it because if you allow people
like Herr Schmidt to got about his business of lying, and cheating, and
being disloyal, one day all the Schmidts in Germany will turn on you and
you will finish as the dumb little corporal you started as, and never
know what hit you…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: He really has to be stupid – I could help
him by telling him about the people he thinks are good Germans… Ha!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What are you staring at? Didn’t you ever see
a man drink before?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s the matter? Haven’t you guys got a
sense of humor? You must have! Look how you’re dressed! Grown men in
their little soldier suits… And the black coats and gloves… Like in a
movie…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Real cloak and dagger stuff… Didn’t you
Gestapo guys ever know that everybody can spot you a mile away? Listen,
if you really wanted to be unnoticed… You should dress like plain
people, then nobody would know you… You might even wear straw hats and
shorts…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Straw hats and shorts!! That’s funny! Now
that’s really funny, isn’t it? Straw hats and shorts!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Well, isn’t that funny? Think of it… That’s
funny! Why don’t you laugh?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I know why you’re not laughing… Because
things you hear, you have to think about… I’ll show you something that
you’ll laugh at because all you’ll have to do is watch…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Ve vill conquer the world… Heil me! Heil me!
Heil me!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: STEINER !!!! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Heil Hitler! arm out like on a Reicher
flips his wrist in answer to the heil, showing complete annoyance at
having to do it.</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Do I see what I think I see here?</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Never put your hands on my desk… is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Now tell me, is this brief correct? Is that
prisoner, the drunk, the one that impersonated the Fuehrer?</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Yes sir! It is!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: I get all the weirdos… Alright, Corporal,
send him in!</p>
<p><strong>corporal</strong>: Yes sir!!!!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Alright, come in, sit down!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Are you Helmut Doork?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Doork, yes sir, Helmut Doork! I am he! Yes
sir, that is correct, Doork!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: And are you a clown in the circus?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: forgetting for a moment his trouble Not JUST
A CLOWN! I am Helmut Doork, Premier Clown! I’ve clowned for the royal
heads of many of our finest countries, why there were times when I had
to…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: That was years ago… According to these
papers you are now just a helper in the circus with little or no
importance!!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Some things are only temporary… Lt. Reicher!
Only yesterday, I had calls from one of the great circus owners in all
of Europe… he…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: You are NOTHING!! You are a HAS BEEN!! You
WERE A CLOWN…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: You are now a prisoner of the State and
that’s not funny… Can you make something funny out of that, Clown?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No! Lt. Reicher, I can’t make anything funny
from that thought…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: It is no thought… It is fact, Clown,
unquestionable fact!! Now down to the issues at hand… Did you willfully
and with malice attack the State and impersonate the Fuhrer?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I was drunk! It was a mistake! I meant no
disrespect… Sir… Honestly, I was drunk and not responsible for my
actions and thoughts! And my actions were subconscious!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Subconscious?? Meaning it was all motivated
by truth that came out under the influence of alcohol!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I am a LOYAL German!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: And what kind of commendation would you
expect for being a loyal German?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I want nothing! But I’m more loyal than most
Germans I know…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Like who?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Ah, like… re…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Names! Names!!! Who?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Sir!!!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know, sir…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: But you said other Germans… What OTHER
Germans… Who are they? Why aren’t they loyal? Who?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m not responsible for what I say now…</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Why? You’re not drinking… you said you
weren’t responsible last night because you were drunk! Are you drunk
now?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No, sir!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Then why are you not responsible now?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know!!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know – sir !!!</p>
<p><strong>reicher</strong>: Why are you not responsible? Why? Why? Why?
Why?</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Excuse me, sir, but I wonder if you would help
me… you see…</p>
<p><strong>s.s. man</strong>: No! Go away!</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: You don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>s.s. man</strong>: You don’t understand… I said go away
!!</p>
<p><strong>s.s. man</strong>: Move along… you swine… move… we haven’t
got all day… move… move… one-two-three-four –</p>
<p><strong>s.s. man</strong>: Move it… move it… move… move… hurry…
faster… faster…</p>
<p><strong>s.s. man</strong>: gate who told her to Now I would be glad
to help you, Fraulein… shall we start with a drink? There is a lovely
little bar around the corner…</p>
<p><strong>ada</strong>: Go away !!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Tsk! tsk! tsk! shame on you, Doork… shame…
don’t you want to grow big and strong like me?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: We must eat our food! Do we want Uncle to
feed the little man?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: him as he puts the And now one for Aunt
Ada…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Let go, Doork, let go… it’s the soup that
makes us big and strong… not the spoon… LET IT GO!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Now let’s try it again…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I said let’s try it again…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh, I know why you’re unhappy… soup without
bread is terrible…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Isn’t that better? Now take some soup…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’ve had enough, thank you… No more,
please…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m surprised at you, Doork, you’ve been here
two years now, you should have learned we, of the Third Reich, never
acknowledge the weak, sniveling, begging of you swine… that’s all you’re
good for… begging… pleading… praying… you’re a disgrace to the human
race. That’s why we of the superior race must do away with all of
you…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: And we will! We will! Do away with all of
you. You’re worthless pigs… with no courage, no guts, why if anyone did
to me what I just did to Doork I would kill him! Why don’t you kill me,
Doork? Go on… kill me… kill me… take the knife from the table and kill
me…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I would kill you… but I am getting my
release any day now… and I won’t do anything that would spoil my
chances…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Your release?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Release? They told me you were funny… but I
never realized just how funny you are… RELEASE ????</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Dear God, please hear me!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: He hears you, my son…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Here, here, easy, you can’t do this to
yourself…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You frightened me, Johann, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You have nothing to be sorry for… Fear
isn’t something controlled by man… fear can not be conferred with… there
isn’t anyway known to mankind where man can say to himself… “I will not
be afraid”… Oh, certainly man can try to fight it… but faith and
believing are man’s only chance… You must have faith… you must!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I have faith… but not always… sometimes it
eludes me… I can’t remember to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: But that’s natural… you can’t expect to be
perfect in what you try to do…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I heard what happened at breakfast this
morning with ROTHMAN, the guard…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Will they do something to me? What have you
heard?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Nothing, absolutely nothing… don’t worry
about it… I just wanted you to know that I believe you handled yourself
admirably…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: That was one time I didn’t care for the
laughs I was getting from some of the men…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Of course you didn’t… but I’m sure you know
man laughs for two reasons… one because something is funny… two, because
they fear showing fear… they laughed because “there but for the grace of
God go I!”</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Do you really think so?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’m certain of it!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Thank you, Johann. I always feel so much
better after you talk to me…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’m glad, Helmut, I’m very glad… you know
you can always talk to me, about anything…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Oh! I almost forgot…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Before breakfast this morning, I spoke to
one of the guards, a very intelligent one, and he seems quite nice and
friendly too. Well, he said that the Gestapo has set up a special review
board to handle cases just like mine. And he said he would get me a
form, a special form. Just been printed up. And I’m to fill it out.
Isn’t that good?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: How many times since you’ve been here, have
you filled out forms? Twenty? Thirty times??</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But this is different. It’s entirely
new.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: See? These are made up by the Gestapo
itself… and the form will go directly to Berlin, to Gestapo
headquarters. That’s the important thing about this… the Gestapo’s in on
it. That’s a very good sign. Isn’t it a good sign?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Yes, my son, it is a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: And I have to be very careful of everything
I put down on the form. The tiniest detail could make the difference.
Don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Isn’t it strange? They are free to go
anywhere they want, and they come here to nest.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Watch the birds eat, Helmut… it’s so
cute…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m sure I’ve got everything here… The
important facts from the moment I was arrested, the questions the
Gestapo officer asked me… now what was his name again? I can’t seem to
remember what his name was…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What the devil was his name?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Oh, yes, Johann… I’m sorry… you were
saying?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You’re not a religious man, are you,
Helmut?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Well, I… ah…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Not sure I am myself anymore.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Yet… when I see those birds, I wonder… were
they sent here to let us know this place really isn’t God forsaken?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: He should have sent them elsewhere… they
could be eaten here!</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: I think we should eat it!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Not on your life… Er, that is… I
wouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: Put it somewhere so it can brighten up the
place.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: It would take a hell of a lot more than that
to brighten up this place.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: It’ll be better than looking at your long
face.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Do you see the way it’s sprouting… I told
you it wasn’t completely rotten.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: That’s nice, Johann. Do you remember when I
filled out those last forms? The date might be important.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: About four weeks ago, I think.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’ll put it up here on the window sill,
it’ll get the morning sun.</p>
<p><strong>stout prisoner</strong>: Think you can trust your potato so
close to me, Reverend?</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: The potato he TRUSTS… it’s you he doesn’t
trust!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All the prisoners from the other side of the
camp are being moved over to this side of the camp over to this side of
the camp. Barracks “H” will make room for three additional bunks.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I want all the bunks moved down toward the
far end. Get them as close together as possible. Now! GET MOVING!</p>
<p><strong>the men</strong>: Gotta have more room… We need more space…
Hey, watch where you’re going. This is stupid!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: YOU! You down there at the end… get those
bunks right up against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hurry it up! Come on, get moving!</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: This arrangement leaves space for one
additional bunk right by the door.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get them close. You’re all going to be nice
and cozy in here.</p>
<p><strong>stout prisoner</strong>: Yeah, like triplets before they are
born to a mother weighing 98 pounds…</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: That’s what I call cozy!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Excuse me, sir, the papers… Did they arrive
yet?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: They’ll have to wait!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You’d think, since he was coming over here
anyway, the least he could do was bring the papers with him.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: This moving men around has undoubtedly kept
him very busy… don’t worry, he’ll bring them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m sure if I asked him again he’d really
become annoyed with me. Would you remind him for me, please?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’ve seen you around the yard, but the
others…</p>
<p><strong>white-haired man</strong>: About thirty of them got here
yesterday from the prison outside of Frankfurt.</p>
<p><strong>1st new prisoner</strong>: bunk above the white- For the last
three months we’ve been shuttled from one camp to another.</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: bunk on the direct Now they’re
shuffling us from one side to another. I think they’re trying to lose
us.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Do you think they’re bringing in war
prisoners?</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: I don’t know why they’re sending them here…
we’re overcrowded as it is.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: No, no… it’s got to be something else…
Otherwise they would have left the bunks.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: It could be possible that he is fixing up the
barracks for some of his lady friends.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: That many women?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Reverend, we Germans are SUPERMEN!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: We might as well be outside.</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: If I get pneumonia, I’ll hold the
government responsible!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: With a little luck, you’ll both get
pneumonia!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: It’s sure quiet in here…</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Hey, Galt! Come over and look at this!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Ain’t it cute?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: It’s a God damn posie!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Looks kinda sick, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: It’s one of them potato things… and it sure as
hell is sick!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Maybe we should put it out of its
misery.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: No, we don’t want to do that… we might break
someone’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Whose little plant is this?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: The plant is MINE!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Is it now? Tell me precious… do you knit,
too?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: If necessary, I can… and I do !</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What do you think of that, Uhlmann… he
knits!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Now, if he could just cook…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Can you cook, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: If necessary, I can cook, yes! Now, if you
don’t mind, I’ll take that plant!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Alright, old man, you really want it?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Go get it!!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Why don’t you pick on someone your own
size…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: that he finally got What?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You heard me! Give him his plant back, and
leave him alone… He didn’t bother you … and if you have to show your
muscle, there’s plenty of other guys to pick on!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: You’re my size!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: He’s alright… that’ll teach him to keep his
nose out of my business… here’s your plant!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Go on, little man, reach for it!</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: You heard him… give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: You’ve had your fun… give it to him… NOW!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Sure, here’s your stupid flower or whatever
you call it…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What’s the matter with you guys? Can’t you
take a joke?</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: What joke?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Hell, all I was doing was trying to have a
little fun.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Have it with someone else!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What’s so special about him?</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: That’s the Reverend. Even when they came and
dragged him from his church… he kept right on preaching against them
until they knocked him unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Well, how the hell was I supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: NOW you know!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: You and your posies…</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: That was close…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Where were you when I need you?</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: I make love, not war! Hey, that’s pretty
good… I made that up… Make love, not war! I bet that would make a good
slogan someday…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Aw, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: That was really very nice of you,
Helmut…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Yeah, nice and STUPID!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What the hell are you doing here? Who gave
you permission to leave your quarters?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Are you some kind of privileged
character?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Then what are you doing out of the
barracks?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If you’ll shut your stupid mouth maybe I can
answer one of your questions!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I have a STUPID MOUTH?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to raise my
voice…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The volume of your voice isn’t the issue…
it’s what comes out of your mouth that disturbs me… maybe you need a
little lesson in respect and courtesy…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: … and maybe I’ve been a little too soft with
you…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You see, Doork, I knew why you came in here…
I knew why you left your barracks without permission… It’s just that I
hadn’t heard you mention your release papers for so long I had hoped I
could hear you begging once more…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m sorry… You’re a sorry specimen
of a human being… that’s what you are…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Now, I will help you to your quarters, Herr
Doork, here you will stay, and pray for release papers that may, or may
not, ever come…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Now, get inside where you belong and don’t
ever let me catch you doing anything without permission again.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Reverend! If you don’t watch that idiot, we
may have to get him a keeper!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Helmut, Helmut, how could you think of
doing such a thing? I begged you not to irritate him… and that I would
ask him about your papers… that wasn’t smart, Helmut… not smart at all…
as a matter of fact…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Leave me alone! … and mind your own
business… Just leave me be…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Reverend, let him sleep… you move out, I’ll
take care of this…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You are a sick looking group of things… I
can’t even call you human… because you’re not… you’re all lice…
DISMISSED!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Doork! Move it out, and on the double!!</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: It looks like Helmut found some new ears to
listen to his Super Star fantasies…</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Adolf to hear as well; a la Shakespeare,
mimicking Ringling Brothers would have done anything for me to appear
with them but I had to do what was best for me!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: So I told Mr. Ringling if he wanted “Helmut”
he’d have to bring his circus to Germany… I am a German, I told him, and
my responsibility is to my own people who are my biggest fans.</p>
<p><strong>1st prisoner</strong>: Did you really say that?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Of course I did… they offered me anything…
anything I wanted to go with them.</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: Hey! I saw the circus in Berlin
about four years ago… Didn’t you make your entrance in a long tail coat
with a pair of tails on the jacket about fifty feet long? Sure! And a
funny Little clown at the very end carrying the tails like a woman’s
train?</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: You were great!</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: You should have seen him… You’d
never know it was him… with the long tails and white tie… red nose… long
hair… and a battered top hat… with the hair hanging way down to his
shoulders… and, ah, let me see… oh, yeah… your mouth went from ear to
ear.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>3rd new prisoner</strong>: How do “clowns” ever come up with
such ideas for faces and make-up?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: It doesn’t happen overnight… it takes years
and years… You try many faces, then finally you hit the one that’s just
right for you.</p>
<p><strong>4th new prisoner</strong>: My kids will never believe this, I
can’t wait to… tell…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Wait, let me tell you some other things… I
mean things that are really exciting and… please! Please… let me just
have a few more…</p>
<p><strong>1st new prisoner</strong>: What’s going on with those
guys?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Did you know “clowns” literally bequeath
their faces to their sons, or sometimes to…</p>
<p><strong>3rd prisoner</strong>: Come on, let’s see what’s such
fun…</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Hey, Galt, it’s your turn, how about doin’
one of your belly dances for us?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Reverend?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Well, Reverend, what do you think? Would a
little belly-dancing be too much for the boys?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: A little fun is what we need… so… if you’ll
all hold the noise down, I’ll join in.</p>
<p><strong>4th new prisoner</strong>: Say, why don’t we get the clown to
do something?</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: A clown? Who’s a clown??</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: You’ve heard of “Helmut Doork”. That’s him
down there!</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Don’t waste your time. You’ll never get the
Great Doork to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>1st new prisoner</strong>: Oh, I’m sure he will!</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: You’re wasting your time. He doesn’t perform
for the likes of us… he’ll turn you down.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: He’s right, we’ve been asking him for three
years… I have a feeling he only does his little routines for the crowned
heads of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: And, of course, the BIG heads of Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>1st prisoner</strong>: How about it, Doork?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: around ready to jump I’d like to, but I
can’t… really… I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Can’t? Did I hear you say you can’t?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: tracks; he stays up I’d like to do
something… but… He can tell you… He’s seen me work… I need props…
make-up… I work with a lot of different things…</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: That’s right… I did… and he
does!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Sure, tell them… I can’t just do anything… I
need lights, props, my costume.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Now, me and these… gentlemen… we don’t expect
you to do your “act”, just a little something that’ll give us a laugh,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Aw, forget it… and that’s probably his
problem… he’s forgotten how!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Wait a minute, you guys… show people have to
be in a mood… Play a little music, like in a circus…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: There! Ain’t that nice? Don’t it put you in a
mood?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I TOLD YOU! I need things to do my act.</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: Hey, Doork, what about that drunk
routine… that was funny…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Yeah, that drunk thing… that does sound
funny…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I still need many things… props and…</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: I don’t remember you using
anything in that drunk routine.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Hey… are you trying to fool us?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Stay out of this, Reverend. We’re not doing
anything… We just want him to join in the fun.</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: Right! If a Reverend can give us a laugh,
why not a clown?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: It doesn’t have to be anything special… a
little dance, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Like that disgusting exhibition you did? Oh,
no… not me!</p>
<p><strong>4th new prisoner</strong>: Go on, Doork, so I can tell my
kids.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Can’t you get it through your heads, I
need…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: WE need you to give us a laugh.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: So… TRY!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: That’s enough, leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Stay out of it, Reverend!</p>
<p><strong>the men</strong>: Choke him harder… see if that’s funny! Make
him dance! Hey, Doork!… be funny now! He don’t look so funny to me! He
sure as hell looks funny to me! Hey, Galt, pull his string and make the
dummy funny!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Your public is calling, clown… now, clown!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What is going on here? On your feet!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: He was showing us some of his funny clown
falls…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Because of all the noise coming from in here
– I have been called up front to explain… I don’t like to be called up
front… I don’t like to have to explain… And, you might not like it,
either. Back to your bunks, all of you… Turn out the lights, and keep
it</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I was just going to ask him about the forms…
my release…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: That was not the time, believe me!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Hurt much?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No, I’m alright… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Johann, why do they pick on me? I’ve never
done anything to them.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You’ve never done anything for them!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You think I should have performed?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: The men would have appreciated it.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Johann!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They don’t believe me, do they? I mean about
being a clown?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Oh, I’d say you’ve convinced most. However
– There is one you haven’t convinced…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You, Helmut… you!</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: Attention! Attention! All prisoners
will assemble immediately in the yard. All prisoners will assemble
immediately in the yard. Attention! Attention!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: They’ve put up barbed wire!</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What the hell… ?</p>
<p><strong>stout prisoner</strong>: Youngsters! They’ve got youngsters
over there.</p>
<p><strong>young prisoner</strong>: Women!</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: Another fence!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What does it mean? What do they need a fence
for?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Misery loves company. Looks like they’re
going to deny us even that.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All right. All right, move. Hurry it up.
Move.</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: Attention! The Commandant issues the
following special order: the north side of the camp is now temporary
quarters for non-Aryan prisoners. Fraternizing between Aryan and
non-Aryan prisoners is strictly prohibited. Any violation of this order
will be severely punished. Heil Hitler… Repeating…</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: The Commandant issues the following
special order:</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: The north side of the camp is now
temporary quarters for non-Aryan prisoners. Fraternizing between Aryan
and non-Aryan prisoners is…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Jews!</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: … strictly prohibited. Any violation of
this order will be severely punished. Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Prisoners from barracks H remain in line.
Barracks H will remain in line.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I said last night I didn’t think I would
enjoy being called up to account for the noise coming from barracks H. I
can tell you this morning I didn’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I don’t know what caused the trouble last
night, but I’m not blaming you entirely. I failed you. I should have
seen that you all have much too much energy for the confined life you
lead here.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: We’re going to correct that. I’ve been told
that energy comes from food.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: So… to help you… all rations are canceled for
the next… forty-eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: And, if that doesn’t quiet you down, I’ll
think of some other ideas you’ll like even less. I’m going to make this
barracks the quietest in the camp. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Now, don’t blame me. I didn’t start the
trouble last night.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Fall out.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>stout prisoner</strong>: I can’t go without food. I’ll
starve.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Helmut, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: He’s the one we can thank for the diet.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Sir? Corporal…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Doork. Helmut Doork. Remember? The papers…
You said… Remember the special forms for the Gestapo to review my
case.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No papers.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What’d you say now, Mr. Doork, Almighty! Last
night he wouldn’t give us a laugh. Today they won’t give us food.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: What were you doing? Making a deal with your
guard pal to slip you some food?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No! I was asking him about the forms he’d
promised to get me. Because of last night… I’m not getting them.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: When this blows over, Helmut, we’ll…</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Don’t feel sorry for him. He’s got no one to
blame but himself. The whole thing was his doing.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: He’s been telling us how great he is; how
funny. Why? Why couldn’t he have done a trick or two for us?</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: The Reverend did a turn. What’s so special
about him?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Don’t start anything here. We’re in enough
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: We’re not starting anything, we’re
finishing something.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: We’ve decided Doork here is going to keep us
laughing so hard we won’t be able to hear our stomachs growling.</p>
<p><strong>stout prisoner</strong>: Better hurry it up, clown. ’Cause my
stomach’s growling already. Can you hear it?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Hear it! The whole place hears it.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Yeah, Doork, do a trick. How about that night
in Munich when they wouldn’t stop laughing. How about it, Doork? Come
on, just a little trick. Give us one laugh. That’s all we’re asking for.
Come on, Helmut, do something.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: He’s going to do it! He’s going to do it!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Nothing pleases an artist more than to
perform. I’m going to do a real show for you. All I ask is that you give
me a little time… time to get things together… things I can use as
props… I’ll even try to make a costume, and…</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: You don’t need a costume. We’ve got
imagination.</p>
<p>****: Right?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Do the drunk pretzel like the kid suggested
last night.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: And do it now, clown. No more stalling.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Let me through.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: Aren’t we good enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: He’d do his tricks fast enough if his guard
pal asked him. Wouldn’t you, Doork?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Do something, Karl. For God’s sake, do
something.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: And be sure it’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: You make us scream… scream with laughter… or
I’ll tear you to shreds on the wire.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: All right… all right.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: If he’s Germany’s greatest clown, God help the
Fatherland. Doork, the Great! You got paid for that? To go without food
is bad enough, but to have to watch that!</p>
<p><strong>2nd new prisoner</strong>: You’re not the clown I saw. You
lied. You’re big all right. A big liar.</p>
<p><strong>4th new prisoner</strong>: And I was going to tell my
kids!</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: He’s no clown. Not even a bad one.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I am. I am a clown!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Give me a chance. I just got started.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: That’s what we’ve been eating our hearts out
to see! You stink. You really stink.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I… I slipped. I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I am a clown. I am. I am.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Doork the Great.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Come back, damn you, come back. The
children… they’re laughing. They’re laughing. I am a clown. I am a
clown.</p>
<p><strong>old prisoner’s voice</strong>: Don’t know how you can go
without shoes. Soles of my feet are too sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: It’s my stomach that’s sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>old prisoner</strong>: Here comes your second helping.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: How’re the shoes?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Don’t forget the bowl.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: Hey, Doork!</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: My shoes!</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: I said you could use ’em, not ruin
’em.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I had to fix them this way… for the act, you
know. Wait till you see how funny it is.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: Yeah. But will I feel like laughing
when it gets cold!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: Worry! I’m the one who’ll get frost
bitten toes, not you.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: When I return them, they’ll be like new. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: For what you’ve done to my shoes I
should get more food.</p>
<p><strong>old prisoner</strong>: He’s got to have something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>old prisoner</strong>: If he gives you his other meal… he’ll
starve to death. Then you won’t get anything.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: Remember… you fix them before you
bring ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner’s voice</strong>: Doork!</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I mean it this time.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Don’t tell us. Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: What am I supposed to do? Use pins?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Who has a pin?</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: You can laugh. He isn’t always after you for
something.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Chalk.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Says he can mash it into a powder and put
it on his face.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: From a guard.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: A very bad Nazi. Still has a heart.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I wish he’d have a heart and use someone
else’s coat. Or better yet – his own.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Finally got it.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Isn’t that what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: This will do more for the act than anything.
Wait’ll you see!</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: For a moment there you had me worried.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I see you got smart.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: His conscience bothered him.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I thought he would kill you when he saw
what you had done to his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I don’t know what I’m laughing at… look at
what he’s doing to my coat. Look at it! Yesterday a button off.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’ve got to have it. It is the only one I
can get on and still is tight enough to look funny.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: At the rate you are tearing it up, it’s going
to look a lot funnier.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Give in, Franz. You know he’s going to talk
you out of it again.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’ll be careful. I swear. Besides, I’ve got
to have it. I explained before… a clown can’t change his costume. It’s
his trademark.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: I know… I know… but…</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Why should he give it to a Jew clown? Right,
kid?</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: That’s got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: What’s the matter with you bastards anyway?
All he ever did for us was cause trouble, but for them… … he can’t do
enough. I say he’s one of them.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: If he were, he’d be over there</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: That’s where he belongs.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: What’re you so hot about? It’s no skin off
your…</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: We’ve got a good reason for not liking
them.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: If it wasn’t for them… we wouldn’t be in
here.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: What’d you mean?</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: A bunch of them got picked up with papers
we’d sold them. And what’d they do? Turn us in, they did. The
ungrateful…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: So that was it! Counterfeit papers. I can
imagine the prices.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Supply and demand, Reverend. Supply and
demand.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: Take it, Doork – anytime you want it.</p>
<p><strong>uhlmann</strong>: What’s so terrible about what we did? Lot
of them got out of the country with our papers. They were damn good
counterfeits.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: And what’s more, we never charged for
children. Never.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’ve been meaning to ask you. Heard anymore
about the request for a review of your case?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Did you hear the laughs I got yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Not just from the children… but the adults,
too.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Never thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They said I couldn’t come up with anything
new.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: At the circus. Schmidt and the rest. Wait’ll
they see my act now. It’s funny. Really funny. Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: The children certainly enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What I needed was time. Time to concentrate
on new material. A man’s got to have time alone.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You call this being alone?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Do you think… maybe… they’d let me go to
other camps and entertain?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’d have to get to the Commandant. Would
need his permission.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If you have time later, I’d like you to see
something I’ve been working on. I hunch down and do a tiny soldier
parading. Think they’ll like it?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Who? The adults?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: The children, of course.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I thought the smart clown only played to
the adults.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: He’s coming back down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>scharff and aide</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Heil Hitler. inner office as he</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Oh, stand at ease. And, close the door.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: I don’t have to tell you why your
Commandant was relieved of his command here. This prison is a disgrace.
Disgrace! The latitude allowed by him will not be tolerated by me.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: That includes the staff. I’m going to turn
this place into a model prison, a credit to the Reich. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Speak up.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: This isn’t the first prison the SS has had
to take over from the military. Military men are too soft to deal with
those… Scharff starts to speak but quickly changes his mind.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: You were about to say something?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Oh… I… was just going to say that I didn’t
hold with the soft treatment of the prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Good! Our first order of business is to
prepare…</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Our first order of business is to prepare
all non-Aryan prisoners for shipment in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Where are they being sent, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Work camps.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: But we have about 40 children, some only
babies, with more scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the next day. They’re
not going to be much use in a work camp.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: I’m aware of that. This order covers only
the adult prisoners over fifteen. We won’t have to wet nurse the
children for long. Other plans are being made for…</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: What is that supposed to be?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: That! Well, you see, sir, one of the
prisoners used to be a circus clown. Sometimes he gives a little… well…
a sort of show – for the children.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: A show! Is this a prison camp or a
traveling circus! Am I correct in assuming that those children are on
the non-Aryan side of the camp?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: And the… buffoon? A German?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Am I to believe you aren’t aware of the
general order absolutely forbidding fraternization?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: I know about it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Close the window.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Just what do you think fraternization
means, Lieutenant Scharff ?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Communication. Social contact. Giving aid,
talking…</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: How long has this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Just the last two or three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: And the Commandant approved?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Well, sir, children are very hard to
handle.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: This clown! Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: It’s… I know. It’s Doork, the Great.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Not his clown name, you idiot. His number.
His identification.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: If I have the Colonel’s permission to
leave, I will check it at once.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Later. Right now I want these performances
halted. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Immediately!</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That’s all. Show’s over. Everybody clear
out.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get back to the barrack. You heard me. Show’s
over.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Go on. Get away.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Move, damn it, before I come over there
and…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get them moving before somebody gets
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: That’s all the show for today. Go back
inside.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: That’s right now, go along. I’ll see you
tomorrow. Goodbye. Goodbye. Until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get inside and take that stuff off your
face.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t understand. What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Orders. No more shows.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You mean… not ever?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But we weren’t doing any harm.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The Commandant thinks you are.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: The Commandant?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The new Commandant. He minds.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Just because I make them laugh a little…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You know the rule… no mixing with Jews.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I wasn’t mixing! I was only…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Look, it’s not my order. It’s the
Commandant’s. Now do what I tell you and save yourself a lot of
grief.</p>
<p><strong>franz</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: He says I’ve got to stop – with the
children.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’ve been expecting it.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Because they’re Jews?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Because of the laughing.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Why should that bother them?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: When you rule by fear, laughter is the most
frightening sound in the world.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I can’t go out there. I can’t take another
day of them staring at me.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: They’ll get over it. Disappointment is no
stranger to those children.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They look at me as though it was all my
fault. Haven’t they been told why I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’m sure they have.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Then why do they stare?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: It’s amazing how a thing like this can feed
off itself. Think how lucky we would be if we could do that.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I sewed a button on. Look all right?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I did make them laugh. Didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I wish they’d get them out of here. Prison
is no place for little children.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: We’ve been all over that before. You’ve got
to stop thinking about them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You’re right! I’ve got to think of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: It’s too hot in here. I’m going to get some
air.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Johann… do you think there’s any possible
way I could talk to the Commandant. Maybe I could make him
understand…</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: There’s nothing you can do… but forget.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: How can I! They were my own very special
audience. And now they stare at me as if I had betrayed them.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: They’re children, Helmut. You can’t expect
them to understand the madness of adults.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If I could talk to them. To the children
themselves – that would help, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If I explain it to them – then they’ll know
I am not mad at them.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You go near that fence once again… and
you’re taking your life in your own hands. You know that as well as I
do.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I would just need a minute. A minute to talk
to them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I wish to God I didn’t care. I wish to God I
could forget them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I’m going to ask you a question, Helmut,
and I want you to think carefully before you answer.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: The reason you can’t get them out of your
mind – is it because you need them – for you audience?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: I want the truth.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I know I can’t perform for them anymore. I
know that. I really don’t know what the reason is. I think it’s got
something to do with… well, I don’t want those little ones to think I’ve
turned against them, too. That’s why I’ve got to do something.
Something.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You’ll be taking a chance. A great
chance.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: All right! Come on then.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You want to talk to the children? Well, I
think I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There’s no reason for you to get involved in
this.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Reason? When war is waged against children!
That is reason enough for the whole damn world to get involved. And it
will, believe me, it will.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: So, come on, Doork the Great, let’s start
getting involved.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: Kessler is going to talk to the children.
Cover him.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: Who says so?</p>
<p><strong>ludwig</strong>: The Reverend says cover him… so we cover
him.</p>
<p><strong>galt</strong>: All right! I was just asking.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: You know what to do?</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Stay behind the men and keep an eye out for
the guards on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: Make it quick. You won’t have much
time.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: And Helmut, keep the children quiet. We
don’t want trouble.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Kick it, Ludwig. Kick it!</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Doork, Doork, Doork is back. It’s Doork.
It’s Doork.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Shhh. Shhhh. The guards…</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Do a trick, Doork. Please, Doork, please,
please.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No, no. I can’t. The guards won’t let me.
Not now. Maybe some other day.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: They’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What is it? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: He hurt himself.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Shhh. Shhh. Don’t cry. It’s going to be all
right. Be careful when you’re near this fence.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Here, wrap this around it. I’ll make it all
better.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Hush now. Stop crying. Please. Look… Look at
this.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There, that’s better. No more crying
now.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s the matter with them?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: They’re new. We can’t understand them.
All they do is cry.</p>
<p><strong>older boy</strong>: They’re all the way from
Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of. Everything
is all right.</p>
<p><strong>adolf</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Here. Look. I’ll show you… No noise now.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No, no, be quiet. Be quiet. Shhh. Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You wouldn’t listen, would you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Go on. Get back.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You back there, get them out of here.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They had nothing to do with it. It was all
my doing.</p>
<p><strong>first ss officer</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>keltner</strong>: The children! Not in front of the
children!</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Yes. Yes. Yes, I understand perfectly.
However, I don’t see how we can be held responsible. Our orders were
very clear. We were to have the freight car ready to be picked up at
midnight. Of course, I’m aware the operation must be kept secret. I just
don’t have the staff to send down there now and… Yes, I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: The freight car wasn’t picked up.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: It’s still down there on the siding!</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Some stupid mix up. If they think…</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Yes, General. Yes, I’m as distressed about
the situation as you are. which he nods his Yes. Personally!
Immediately! Yes, General. You can leave it in my hands. Heil
Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Who did you leave in charge down there?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Sergeant Hoffman. Very reliable.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Apparently not reliable enough. The cargo
seems to be raising quite a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Fifty children, sir! In a boxcar!</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: I know. I know. But the siding isn’t far
from town. The General doesn’t want unauthorized persons getting
curious. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: I’ll get some men down there right
away.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Men! You’ll get yourself down there. And
take at least a dozen guards with you. Don’t let anyone get close to
that boxcar… under any circumstances. No one !</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: I wondered, sir, if you might have any
suggestions as… well… how do we quiet children?</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Use any method you can, but shut them up.
That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Sir, the clown!</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: The one who amused the children</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Out of the question. The man’s being
disciplined for that very thing. We can’t change our position now.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: No one need know.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: He’d know.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Sir, if I could guarantee he’d never say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: You see, sir, he’s been trying to get a
review of his case. Claims he’s here by mistake. I could tell him you
would recommend the review.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: A man who wants something. Good. Very good
strategy, Lieutenant. However, when you bring him back here, return him
to solitary and keep him there. I’ve seen the best of men, after several
years in solitary, unable to remember even their own names.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Then I have your permission to take the
clown.</p>
<p><strong>bestler</strong>: Permission granted.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Wish you could’ve gotten the big shoes. The
children laugh so when they see them flopping up and down.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: The Commandant, himself, asked for me! You
say he’s personally requesting a review of my case! Why, that means I’m
practically on my way back to Berlin. Should be red. Mouth looks better
in red. Know the first thing I’m going to do when I get to Berlin? Buy
an overcoat with a fur collar. Had such a coat. Very elegant. Very
elegant. turned corners of It’s a good idea… moving the children.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Prison’s no place for children. I said all
along that it was some kind of mistake.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Finish your makeup. We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Know what Johann Keltner said?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Keltner. From my barracks. The minister. He
said… Let me think. He said… men who wage war on children. That’s it.
Men who wage war on children… commit such a crime… … such a heinous
crime. That’s it. Men who wage war on children commit such a heinous
crime that even the devil damns their souls.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Any word about the train yet?</p>
<p><strong>hoffman</strong>: No, sir. The last we heard – it won’t get
here until evening.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Anyone been around?</p>
<p><strong>hoffman</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: With all that wailing, it’s a wonder.
Couldn’t you keep them quiet?</p>
<p><strong>hoffman</strong>: I didn’t know what to do, Lieutenant. I was
afraid to close both doors.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Keep a tight guard on the whole area. No
one gets near here. Understand? You post them.</p>
<p><strong>hoffman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Leave that here.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Over here, Clown.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They’re crying.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Take that in to them.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Bread. They won’t wait so loud with their
mouths full.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: How… how long have they been here?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: You just get in there and keep them quiet.
You can do that, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Do a good job and I’ll personally ask that
you get a favorable decision on your case. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>older girl</strong>: Doork? It’s Doork. It is! It is!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: So this is where you’ve been hiding?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I want to go home. Take me home.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Now, now, there’s nothing to cry about.
We’re going to have fun. and picking up the Here. I brought you
something. The children pounce on the sack and tug at it, unsure what it
is except that it’s a gift from Helmut.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Wait now. Don’t open it yet. Wait’ll I get
in. You help me.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Look, I’m a Jack-in-the-box.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: We’re all Jacks-in-the-box – the same
box.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Well… who’s hungry.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: All right, I want everybody to sit down.
When I count three, everybody sit. Ready? One, two…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Oh, you’re too fast. Three!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Now… what’ll we do?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: I want to see my Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You would? All right.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: You know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: She’s right here with you.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: I don’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: That’s because you don’t know how to look.
I’ll show you. Close your eyes. All of you… close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Everybody’s eyes shut? Now, think about your
mommys and Daddys… There, don’t you see them? Can’t you see their
faces?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: So you see! They’re right here with you. All
you have to do is look in your hearts.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Does Mommy see me, Doork?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Yes, she does. She has you safe in her
heart, too.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’ve got an idea. You all know my name, but
I don’t know yours. So let’s find out everybody’s name, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You… come here and I’ll show you what we’ll
do.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Willie.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Willie. That’s a good name. How do you spell
it?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Fine. I’ll just write that on top of your
head.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There. See, this way we’ll all be able to
tell everybody else’s name just by looking at his head.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Did you really?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Of course I did. Here…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Tell him what it says.</p>
<p><strong>older boy</strong>: It says Willie.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Really? Truly?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Be careful. Don’t smear it. Let’s see now…
Yes. You shall be next.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Forgive me. I don’t speak your language.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: See! We understand each other. Now… Willie.
Doork. Willie. Doork.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: A beautiful name! Now you tell all the
children.</p>
<p><strong>czech girl</strong>: Inga.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: It’s such a pretty name… say it again.</p>
<p><strong>czech girl</strong>: Inga!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I-N-G-A. There it is.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Let’s see now. Who wants to be next.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Her?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: So the little children will know her
name.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Of course. That way she can’t get lost, can
she? What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Frederika.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Frederika?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Frederika!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Couldn’t we just make it Freda?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Oh, no! Frederika.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Clown. Clown, can you play one of
these?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: I got it to send home to my boy…
but if it’ll help…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: It will. It will.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: You won’t say anything to the
Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Guard… guard.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: It’s going to be dark soon. The little ones
may be afraid. Do you think… well… could you get some kind of a light
for in here?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Want to get me in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: I would if I could.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I know. I know you would.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s the matter? It’s all right – just a
bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>older girl</strong>: Doork.</p>
<p><strong>older girl</strong>: Where are they sending us?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>older girl</strong>: Do you have children?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I do now.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: It finally got here.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Help them get the car coupled on.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: All right, clown, time to get
off.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Train is here. They are hooking it
up now. Here. Tell them not to light it up until the doors are
closed.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: And get off right now.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: We’re moving. What’s happening? What was
the noise? Doork, where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: It’s nothing. You’re going for a train ride.
What do you think of that? A real train ride.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Is it far? Are you coming, too? I don’t
want a train ride.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Oh, it’ll be fun. I would like to come, but
I don’t think I can.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Please come, Doork. Please. Please.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I can’t. They want me to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But… I’ll come to see you. Soon as I can.
And, I want you all to promise me to be very good. No crying.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: If you want me… remember, just close your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What’s this now? Crying? After all the fun
we’ve had?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s his birthday. He thought there would be
presents.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: He’s a Czech. Do you speak…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Then how do you know it’s his… birthday?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He told me.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: He speaks German?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: But he told you it’s his birthday?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: What date is this?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why, it’s his birthday!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Don’t you believe him?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Of course, I do. Tell him I wish him a happy
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He knows that. But… but what’re you going to
do about a present?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Aha, the very thing. He can be the clown
while I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>german boy</strong>: He’s a boy! Dolls are for girls.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: When you give something you love… it doesn’t
matter if it’s the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Maybe we have time for a birthday game. A
quick one. Let me take a look.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Everybody line up behind me now, and I’ll
show you how a train goes. Wait – the harmonica.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: May I borrow it back… for just a minute or
two?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: For just a minute – then I’ll give it right
back to you. Just for the game.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Good. Now everybody… line up behind me.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Grab hold of the one in front of you… ’cause
we’re going to be a fast express train.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: All aboard. All aboard.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Open the door! Let me out… LET</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Guess I’m going with you after all.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Let’s play some more, Doork?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: I’m glad that’s over. Call in the
sentries.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Kessler in the car?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Kessler?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: The clown?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: I… I guess he is, sir.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: You GUESS!</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: I told you to get him off the train.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: I told him, sir. HE was standing
right by the door. I’m sure he got off.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: Why, I…</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: DID you?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: You told me to see that the car
was coupled on. When I came back… Why wouldn’t he get off?</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: Idiot! Guards. GUARDS!</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: The clown prisoner is missing. He may have
escaped. Search the area. If he got off the train he must be around here
someplace.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: You know what happens if he gets away.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant hoffman</strong>: He can’t get very far.</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: If he’s on that train – he’s going farther
than you know —</p>
<p><strong>scharff</strong>: … or he knows.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: What is it? Are we there, Doork? Where are
we? Why are we stopping?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: Everybody up. No noise.</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: How the devil did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I… I’m from the other prison. Got locked in
– by accident.</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: Ah, for… Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: Look at this. He’s from the other camp.
Got in here with the shipment.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: How did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I… I was taking care of the children back
there and… accidentally got locked in.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Of all the… What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Doork. Helmut Doork.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Put him in the truck with the others. And,
let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: All right, in the truck, quick now!</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: I said move!</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Wait. Let me. Everybody up. Come on. Up, up,
up.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Don’t you want me to stay with them? They’ll
be frightened without me.</p>
<p><strong>burly guard</strong>: Not for long, they won’t.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: That’s enough. Get them inside and keep
them quiet.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Do as he says. And, don’t worry, I’ll be
with you soon. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Come along, now.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: This is just another prison.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’d you expect?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I thought the children were going to a
better place.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Close the door, and wait out there.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: You’re a remarkable man. Very
remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Have you any idea where you are?</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Auschwitz. This is Auschwitz. Mean anything
to you? You may have observed we’re enlarging our facilities.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Still a great deal of work to be done. It’s
going to be our most efficient, most modern prison. And, I might add,
most unique. Helmut, studying him</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Yes, you are a remarkable man. I always
wonder about remarkable men. Why did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I explained. I got locked in the boxcar
and…</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Ah, yes. An accident. Unavoidable I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I was taking care – I mean, the Commandant
requested me to take care of the children.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: The Commandant!</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: I’ve spoken to YOUR Commandant. He hs you
listed as an escaped prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Escaped! But…</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: … it was an accident. Are you one of them,
clown?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: No… no! I’m not one of them. I’m not !</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: You misunderstand completely. The Judas goat
is never killed. He isn’t worth killing. I’m just asking you to lead
them.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Not… even to save your own life?</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: I’m glad to see you’re not a self- appointed
martyr.</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Just think! Now you’re really one of us.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Sir… Sir… could I… could I have a little
time with them before … before…</p>
<p><strong>runkel</strong>: Yes. Yes, of course. I can give you about
half an hour. You see, we’re not heartless men here.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Remember what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There won’t be any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Doork, Doork, you came back. You came
back. We thought you’d left us. Don’t leave us, Doork.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There. There. It’s all right. It’s all
right. Everything is going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Now I want everyone to put on a big smile
and sit down, because we’re going to have more fun than we’ve ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Good. We’ll start by seeing that we all have
our names on our heads.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Yes, yes. There’s Fritz, Maria, Sadie, Inga,
Josef, Nathan, Helga, Willie…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Ah, yes, Frederika! Good. I see all of your
names.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Now… on with the show. Just watch this.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Doork! Doork… you’re great !</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Just a few more minutes?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: I’ll bring them.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: What’s the matter, Doork? Where are we
going? You come with us this time. Where’re they taking us.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: They… they want us to move to another
building… where we’ll have more room… to play. Tell you what. Let’s make
it a big circus parade. Everybody get in a line behind…</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: … behind Willie here.</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: Now, where’s our band? The harmonica?</p>
<p><strong>helmut</strong>: There we are? Everybody ready? Here we
go.</p>
<p><strong>first guard</strong>: Their clothes! They’ve got to
undress.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Leave them alone.</p>
