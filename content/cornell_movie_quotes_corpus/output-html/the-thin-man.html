<p><strong>tom</strong>: Your daughter’s here, Mr. Wynant.
Mr. Wynant!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m sorry… but…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Two weeks work gone for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I just wanted to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I don’t care what you wanted to tell me.
You’re through! Get your things and get out!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: It’s a good thing I’m going away – no peace
– no quiet. Everybody interrupting me –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Can we come in?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sorry, Miss Wynant. He didn’t give me a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Why didn’t they tell me you were here?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m sorry to interrupt your work, but this
is important.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Another young man.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: It’s the same one.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s been the same one for three
months.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Forgive me. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please
try to remember him… ’cause he’s going to be your son- in-law.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Well!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: That is, if it’s all right with you.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: And if it isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’ll still be your son-in-law!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: You see how much we have to say.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask
you….</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Mind if I look around?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this
gentleman…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Home!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Home?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m fired.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Who fired you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Oh, forget it – forget it. Here … show this
gentleman around…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Right this way, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Mother’s set her heart on a big church
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Yes, she would.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I hate all that fuss. But I’ll do it on one
condition – that you’re there to give me away.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: What would your mother say to that?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: This is my wedding.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Wouldn’t it be a little embarrassing … all
of us there … your other and me and your stepfather?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He can stay home. Please, Dad, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: If you think it’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I’m
leaving town tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: It’s a secret. I can’t even tell you, my
dear. I’ve got an important idea to work on.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: A new invention?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Yes. And I don’t want anybody to steal it
from me.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: We were planning to be married right after
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Oh, I’ll be back before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s a promise?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: That’s one thing I won’t forget. Where’s
Macaulay? I ought to be starting.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: How’s your brother?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I’d like to see him. Why don’t you bring him
down?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You know how it is, Dad. He’s sort of under
Mother’s thumb.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I know – I know –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You’re not missing much. He’s cuckoo.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow…
…has he seen the whole family?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And he still wants to marry me!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: He’s a brave man.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I didn’t know you invented that Smelting
Process.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Look – those are the first metals that came
through.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Poor Dad, does that still bother you?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Only in bad weather.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But it isn’t bad weather now.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Better get home before it is.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Goodbye, darling. Don’t you dare forget…
December 30th.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Goodbye, my boy. Take care of Dorothy. Show
her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: All settled? Grand! Why did your mother ever
divorce him? He’s swell.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Oh. I’ll do my own typing!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Dad’s a good barometer… Quick! – Here’s a
cab.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hello, there, Mr. Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: How are you? Here. Get under this.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Thanks… we’re taking your cab.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Is your father still in there?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Did he tell you where he was going?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He wouldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Tch-tch-tch – Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.
You wouldn’t drive slowly, so you don’t get a tip.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That’s okay – I took it!</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Mr. Wynant… Mr. Wynant!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Hello, there! Come on up with me.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Did you get my money?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I do wish you’d tell me where you’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I’m not telling anyone.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: But suppose some business comes up…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: That’s just why I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: One hundred… two hundred… three…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I wish you’d count them. There’s a
thousand dollars there.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Isn’t there anything else I can do for
you? Have you bought your ticket?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Well, let me do that for you.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: You might do that. Get me a ticket for… No,
you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Thanks, and goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: What’ll I do if something comes up?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer
for?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Is Julia going with you?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: But what if you need more money?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I left instructions with Julia. She’ll get
it from you. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: You don’t tell me a thing. I don’t know
where you’re going. I don’t know when you’re coming back. I don’t know
how to reach you if any business turns up…!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: My daughter’s going to be married, Tanner.
Nice young man. She just brought him.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Well, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I’m going to give her a wedding present.
Thought I’d better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my
way to… That’s funny…. Where are those bonds?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Bonds, sir?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I know I left them there.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Maybe Miss Wolf has them.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Maybe she has.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You’re forgetting the check for your
suitcase. It’s at the Grand Central.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Oh, yes – yes – that’s right –</p>
<p><strong>julia’s voice</strong>: How do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Straight. Do women really wear them
things?</p>
<p><strong>full shot of the apartment – a penthouse – process</strong>:
GLASS.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: You’re in the wrong place, mister.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: What’s on your mind? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>julia’s voice</strong>: Who is it, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: That’s what I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: We’re just having a little drink.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: So I see.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: See you later, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know I was talking to the
boy friend. S’long.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Who’s that man?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: He’s not anybody. Just a fellow I used to
know.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I thought you’d given up that sort of
friend.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: This is the first time I’ve seen him in
years. I didn’t want him to think I was high-hatting him.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I don’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Don’t worry. You won’t see him again. What
happened? Did you change your mind about going?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: No. I just came back for a second. I wanted
to get those bonds.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: What bonds?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: The government bonds. The ones you took from
the office safe.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long
time ago.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I’d never tell you to sell those. I bought
them for my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Don’t you remember….</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Now see here, Julia. You’re counting a
little too much on my being absent-minded. You’ve been taking a little
here and there for some time, and I haven’t said anything about it. But
this is fifty thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Do you realize that you’re accusing me of
….</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: No one else had the combination of that
safe. You took them. What did you do with them?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: What if I did take them? I’m sick and tired
of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of
yours….</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: That’s my business.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: supporting that gang of loafers! There’s not
one of them that cares a damn for you. A wife who threw you out the
first time your foot slipped. They wouldn’t raise a hand to help you.
And I’ve given my whole life for you. If you kicked off tomorrow,
where’d I be? Out in the gutter! Sure I took those bonds. Who has a
better right – ?</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: I want that money right now, or I’ll hand
you over to the police.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: They’ll be pretty rough with you….with your
record.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: That’s a fine thing to throw up to me after
all I’ve been to you….</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Hello …. give me …. Well …. ?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: I’ll give it back to you …. all I’ve got
….twenty-five thousand…</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: You’re going to return every cent of it!</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: I can’t! I haven’t got it!</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: What did you do with the rest?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: I never had it.</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Then someone was in with you. Who was it? –
Who was it? I’ll answer that – Hello … hello …</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: Hello … hello … hello … HELLO ….</p>
<p><strong>wynant</strong>: You don’t need to tell me. I have a pretty
good idea.</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Cheer up, darling.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Here’s to us!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: By this time next year, we’ll be two old
married people … trimming the tree … hanging up the stockings for the
children … … well, the child, then.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What’s the matter, darling … not sweet
enough?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Darling, your father’s all right. He’ll turn
up in time.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: But tonight is Christmas Eve!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: He’s just forgotten. You know he forgets
everything.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’s never forgotten a promise to me. I’m
worried about him. I know something’s happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: What could happen to him, darling? You
mustn’t worry…. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Just a minute…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Another Martini –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hello, there!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello! Make it two! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You know, we know each other.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course we do! We’ve been friends for
years.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Aren’t you Nick Charles?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You don’t remember me….. I’m Dorothy
Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not that scrawny little….?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you ever remember me?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: was fascinated with you…. a real live
detective…. You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they
true?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Andy… this is Nick Charles. He worked on a
case for father.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is
your father?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s what I was going to ask you. he’s
disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Now don’t say that – he’s just off somewhere
working.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can’t find him. I’ve tried everything. I
thought you might know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know anything – I’ve been in
California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named
Mac– something.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s it… Herbert Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: tried him once -</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why don’t you try him again?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Here’s a nickle.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: She’s got me worrying, too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t start worrying about him. He’s a good
guy, but screwy.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Why did that man want to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Said he stole his invention.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Do you suppose….. ?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You better take a drink.</p>
<p><strong>nora’s voice</strong>: Asta! Where are you going? Asta!</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Madame, you can’t bring that dog in
here!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m not bringing him. He’s bringing me! Asta!
Asta!</p>
<p><strong>attendants</strong>: But Madame… dogs aren’t allowed…. It
isn’t only your dog… but if we started…. Madame, you dropped your
package…. etc.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: So it’s you he was after!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, baby.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He’s dragged me into every gin mill on the
block.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I had him out this morning.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I thought so. He even tried to drag me into
the gentlemen’s –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, this is Andy –</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How’re you, Andy? I don’t usually look this
way, but I’ve been Christmas shopping.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Madame, I’m afraid you’ll have to….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s all right, Joe. It’s my dog… ….and my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You might have mentioned me first.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s well-trained. He’ll behave himself.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: As long as there isn’t a fire hydrant. What
I’ve gone through –</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: He might bite someone.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s all right. Now lie down. Lie down! Well
then, stand up! See?</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’s just around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No. The lawyer – I’m going to see him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, my wife – Dorothy Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How do you do? I’m sorry we have to
rush.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.
Why don’t you drop around?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Thanks. We will. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If you like ’em like that.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You got types?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Only you, darling… lanky brunettes with wicked
jaws.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was hoping I wouldn’t have to tell you.
Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I
was so young. I didn’t know what I was doing. We were all like that on
my father’s side.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: By the way, how is your father’s side?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Much better, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How many drinks have you had?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Six Martinis.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Six Martinis. You’re not going to have
anything on me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What hit me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That last Martini.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can’t lie here. I’ve got to get up and trim
that darned Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Macaulay. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Dorothy told me you were here. I was going
to telephone but….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s all right. What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Nothing, thank you. Nothing. I wanted to
see you… What’s Mimi up to, Charles?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mimi? … Oh, Dorothy’s mother. Does she have to
be up to something?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: She usually is. Trying one way or another
to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -
–sleuthing for her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I haven’t been a detective for four years.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: You don’t say –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My wife’s father died and left her a lumber
mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I’m
looking after them.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I see. I see.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s all the fuss about? Is he in
hiding?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: You know as much about it as I do. I
haven’t seen him in three months.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No word at all?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: He sends word through Julia Wolf when he
wants money… I give it to her and she gives it to him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So that’s still on?</p>
<p><strong>nora’s voice</strong>: Hello…. just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s for you. Your office.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it’s
you.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My wife.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: How do you do? What did you say?…. He
is?…. Where is he? Very well. He’s back in town…. Wynant. Thank heaven.
He’s waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles… but I’ve been so
upset. It’s no joke working for a man like that. I must be off.
Goodbye…. Goodbye,</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: S’long.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If anyone says “Merry Christmas” once more,
I’ll kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m going to telephone that poor kid. At least
she’ll be glad to know he’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Shall I use this…. or this? Asta! Asta! Our
nice Christmas tree.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: May I speak to Dorothy —-</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: How are you?…. Oh, I’m Mrs. Jorgensen now….
No, she isn’t here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the
message?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Oh, here she is.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your
father’s alive and all right.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, thank heaven.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What is it? Has he found him?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Do you know where he’s living? Oh…. Well,
at least I’m glad he’s all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: That isn’t true. It was about your father.
Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He’s all right. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You just want money – and you haven’t any
right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: That’s gone long ago. I’ve got to see him.
Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I won’t have you hounding him any more for
money.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You’ve been listening again on that
extension.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Of course. What’s an extension for?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he
say?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: He said that father’s in town. He’s been
seeing Julia right along.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: That woman!</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: She could tell you where father is.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Mother …. you couldn’t do that. You
couldn’t go to her.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I didn’t say I would. But we’ve got to have
money.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that Chris might
work?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Shush!</p>
<p><strong>mimi’s voice</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: You’ve hurt his feelings!</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: You know, you have an Oedipus complex and
you won’t admit it.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, please, Gilbert!</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: The trouble with you is that you won’t face
facts. I know I have a mother fixation… but it’s slight…… it hasn’t yet
reached the point of…</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Don’t mind what she says, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: How can I help but mind? I’m constantly
humiliated… just because I haven’t money.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’ll get some.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: You’ve said that for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: Why don’t you go to see Julia? She
handles his money.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I couldn’t go near that woman.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: I said all right!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: Just what I said I’d do.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: You wouldn’t do that… you wouldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: Wouldn’t I. Just watch me.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris – Chris – !</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Miss Wolfe? Well this is Mrs. Jorgensen… I
wonder if I may see you?</p>
<p><strong>julia</strong>: Why yes …. yes…..</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What is Miss Wolfe’s apartment number?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Nine A.</p>
<p><strong>clerk’s voice</strong>: Who shall I say?</p>
<p><strong>mimi’s voice</strong>: Miss Wolf expects me.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Quick! Quick! Send somebody up here right
away. Something terrible has happened!</p>
<p><strong>1st officer</strong>: The way these dames get by with things
makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: Yeah? – Julia Wolfe, 145 West 55.</p>
<p><strong>1st officer</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>1st officer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>2nd officer</strong>: A dame – murdered.</p>
<p><strong>1st officer</strong>: That’s more like it.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Telephone, Mr. Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: The police.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Hello… Murdered! … Yes, yes, I’ll be right
over.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Out making some money.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: I haven’t got it yet.</p>
<p><strong>1st cleaning woman</strong>: What’re you goin’ to tell
’em?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cleaning woman</strong>: I guess you got to tell ’em
everything.</p>
<p><strong>1st cleaning woman</strong>: Do you think Mr. Wynant….?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cleaning woman</strong>: All I know’s they had an awful
fight a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: All right, girls.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: How’yer, Studsy.</p>
<p><strong>studsy</strong>: Diden you know Julia Wolfe?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>studsy</strong>: Somebody just bumped her off I thought you’d
like to know.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: When was the last time you gave her money for
Wynant?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Yesterday. I gave her a thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Seen any signs of it, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Perhaps it was a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: And her with that sparkler on her hand, and
thirty dollars in her purse? Looks to me like our friend Wynant came to
collect and ran into a little trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: They say downstairs they haven’t seen him in
three months.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: There’s a lot of things they don’t see in
this place. And you say you haven’t seen him or heard from him in that
time?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I said he hadn’t written me.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Oh, then you did hear from him?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Well….</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Well, what?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: He telephoned me today.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: He did!</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I wasn’t in. My secretary took the
message. He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: About three.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Did you go?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Yes. But he didn’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: His house and his shop is closed. And he
ain’t at any hotel.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You’re not going to stop at that, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I know he’ll turn up as soon as he sees
this in the papers. You can’t think he had anything to do with it,
Mr. Guild. He wasn’t the kind of man that….</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Do you know what they fought about that night
he went away?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I didn’t know they had a fight.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Well, thanks. We’ll call you when we need you
again.</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Mr. Guild, here’s something very
interesting…</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: and there she was lying dead. The police said
she’d probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: I thought you said you weren’t going
there.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Why, you said…</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Did they find any clues… a gun or
fingerprints or anything?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Was there much blood?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Don’t. It’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Nonsense! She got at she deserved.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Gilbert!</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Why not? You had a perfectly good
motive.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I hope you won’t talk that way to the police
when they come here.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: The police. I thought you said they’d
finished with you.</p>
<p><strong>mimi’s voice</strong>: They said they’d finished for the
present.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Well, I’ve got my alibi. I was at the
Public Library. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Children, will you go into the next room? I
want to talk to Chris alone.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>jorgensen</strong>: I’ll be in my room.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Is Mrs. Jorgensen in?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Yes, come right in!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: There are a few things we want to check up
on.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You say you were in the room with the body
from the time you discovered it ’til we came?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Why yes.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe’s
hand?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Are you sure you didn’t leave the room… that
one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I don’t think so. Of course I was terribly
upset… I hardly knew what I was doing.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: The Medical Examiner seems to think that the
body was touched. He says it looks as if the girl’s hand had been forced
open after she was killed….</p>
<p><strong>guild’s voice</strong>: And we just found out she had a
thousand dollars the night before.</p>
<p><strong>mimi’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: That’s all right. Well, we’ll be going.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Could I go down and see the body? I’ve
never seen a dead body.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Why do you want to?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I’ve been studying psychopathic
criminology. I have a theory. Perhaps this as the work of a sadist or a
paranoiac. If I saw it, I might be able to tell.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: That’s a good idea. But don’t you bother to
come down. We’ll bring the body right up here. Come on, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy’s voice</strong>: What have you got there?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You took that money from Julia’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Then what are you hiding?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: It’s a piece of evidence that’s worth a great
deal more than that.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You hand that over to the police.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’ll do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: All right, then. I’ll tell them.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I don’t think you will. It’s your
father’s.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t believe it! You’re lying!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Now do you believe me!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. quinn</strong>: Who are they, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All my old friends.</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: Hey, Nick. I think your wife’s great.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks. I wanted you to see her… and I wanted
her to see you.</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: It’s like old times, Nick. Remember
the fun we used to have when we were both flat broke?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do I!</p>
<p><strong>police captain</strong>: Those were the good old days.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t kid yourself. These are the good old
days.</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: Nick Charles here?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes. Nick!</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: You his wife?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: He’s a good guy. He sent me up the river
once. Hey, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Face!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: A long time.</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: Well, I needed the rest.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Was he a good detective?</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: I wouldn’t know. That time he caught me was
a accident. I led with my right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on. Have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Don’t bother to announce any more. Just send
anybody right up. I know. But it’s all right. They’re his friends,</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Like to buy a piece of this pug, Nick? I’ll
sell you twenty-five percent of him for five grand.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is he good?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: He’s been knocking ’em cold. He ain’t
afraid of nobody. Drop that, or I’ll slug you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here you are – it’s good stuff – I got it
before repeal.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Look, Nick. Remember? These are the ones you
got back for me.</p>
<p><strong>peppler</strong>: Them real?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ugh-ugh! This is your night off.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: –32 degrees below in Utica. Here’s the
latest news of the Julia Wolf murder. The police have found out that the
beautiful blonde secretary was once a gangster’s girl. They are now
looking for the gangster. Clyde Wynant, the girl’s employer is still
missing. This case will….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can’t you fellows ever forget business?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Good case for you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Haven’t you heard the news? I’m a gentleman
now.</p>
<p><strong>nora’s voice</strong>: Nick! Reporters!</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: I’m from the American,
Mr. Charles.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Mirror.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: We wanted to know if you’d give us a
statement. We hear you’re here to work on the Julia Wolf case.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry. I don’t know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Come on, gimme a break.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I never tried to kid you reporters – I’m
telling you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My wife’s on a bender. I’m trying to sober her
up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on – relax – Give them a drink.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: We need ice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What small glasses you have, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>st reporter</strong>: Listen, isn’t he working on a case?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sure. He’s working on a case of Scotch. Pitch
in and help him.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Isn’t she grand? I take off my hat to
her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs, quinn</strong>: Your hat! You’re getting
conservative!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’d better order some food. That sounds like
an interesting case. Wouldn’t you like to take it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I haven’t the time. I’m much too busy seeing
that you don’t lose any of the money I married you for.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Room service, please -</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sounds like a good case. Girl mysteriously
murdered. No one knows who did it. They haven’t found any clues yet – no
gun – no fingerprints –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wonder if they’ve – I don’t want to hear
anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Isn’t that my drink?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Rye.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah – that’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Listen - I want a whole flock or sandwiches
–</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: I’d like to telephone my mother… wish her a
Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Go ahead, Foster.</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: ’Fraid I can’t pay –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: Long distance – give me San Francisco –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’ve got to see you alone!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Hello, beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Go on in there.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Who’s the little blonde?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Used to bounce it on my knee.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Which knee? Could I touch it?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: House detective!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You heard about Julia Wolf?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you trying to tell me? That you did
it?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes. I hated her for coming between my
mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there
to ask her where he was. She wouldn’t tell me, and I shot her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where did you hit her?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why… in the heart.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: She fell down.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did she make any sound? Didn’t scream?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Which way did she fall?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: She… she fell over backwards.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, yeah? People fall toward a shot, you know…
not back from it. I knew you were lying.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where did you get this gun?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I bought it in a pawn shop.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: That’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: This is awful of me – to make a nuisance of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Don’t be a dope. Have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: There’s powder and stuff over there.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Make her take that.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She brought it in. Trying to make me believe
she did it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothing, ’til I find out if it’s the gun Julia
Wolf was killed with. Keep her in here, and don’t let those reporters
see her. They might believe her.</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: Isn’t that Dorothy Wynant?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. Here…here. She doesn’t know anything
about it.</p>
<p><strong>second reporter</strong>: And you said you weren’t on the
case.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not. I don’t know a thing about it, and I
don’t care a thing about it. All I want is a drink.</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: Hello, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: But I just got San Francisco … How are you,
Ma?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Get off the line, will you, Ma? I got some
business. Give me Drydock 4 - 8000.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, don’t do that! Now don’t tell your paper
that I’m working on anything, ’cause I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: He’s just working on that little gal.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Oh, Nick… Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Mimi.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: want to talk to you about something very
important.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on in here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry. This is the only place we can be alone;
Won’t you sit down?</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Wynant. My name
is Diamond. Come on in and have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: As a matter-of-fact, I don’t either.
I’d much rather talk…</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Clyde Wynant’s crazy… absolutely crazy to stay
away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to
do with it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Oh, I know he didn’t, but I wish I could find
him… I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won’t help at
all. He thinks I just want money.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: You’re always teasing.</p>
<p><strong>foster</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Nick, you will help me find Clyde – won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in
New York. Hire one of them.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: But he knows you. All you have to do is get in
touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right… but
that I’ve got to see him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I tell you again, I don’t want any part of it.
Now you take Dorothy home and…</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Dorothy! Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If you finish this, you’ll feel better.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What did you tell him? What did you tell
him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She didn’t tell me a thing.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Too bad you didn’t bring your whip.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m so excited I didn’t know what I was doing.
Come on, Dorothy, we’ll go home.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: She’ll go home if she wants to. You can stay
here you know. There’s plenty of room and we’d love to have you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Thanks. But I’ll go home.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Where’s Gilbert?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be
living in the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: There’s a physiological as well as a
psychological angle in my father’s relationship with Julia Wolf that the
police have overlooked. And I think it explains everything. You see, my
father was a sexogenarian.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: He was?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Yes. He admitted it.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I
can’t put that in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: You know how they are… sex…</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Then just say he was sixty years old.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Is that what it means?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, son.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Come on…. give me a break. You owe it
to me after that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I swear I haven’t a thing to do with it.
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Mr. Charles, I’d like to lay a proposition
before you. I can’t discuss it over the telephone, but if you’ll give me
half an hour of your time… it’s about the Julia Wolf….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello… hello…</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just a man trying to sell me insurance.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Where’s that girl?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: How’d they go?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Out the back way.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I love you, Nickie, ’cause you know such
lovely people!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Good. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s jolly.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Don’t you think you’d like to go back to
detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can’t you get to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe a drink would help you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe it would if I took it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Everybody says you were a grand detective.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They were kidding you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’d like to see you work.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tomorrow I’ll buy you a whole lot of detective
stories.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That poor girl is in a tough spot.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s nothing I can do to help her.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: She thinks you can. It wouldn’t hurt you to
find out if you could, would it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia
and Dorothy knows it. And the police’ll catch him without my help.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I think I would like that drink. I’ll give you
your Christmas present now if you’ll give me mine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: At breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But it’s Christmas now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you going to give me? I hope I don’t
like it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’ll have to keep them anyway. The man at
the Aquarium said that he wouldn’t take them back.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Did you hear a knock?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Mr. Charles here?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I gotta talk to him… that’s all. But I
gotta do that.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You wait here. I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick! Nick! There’s someone to she you,</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s great. I was afraid I’d have to go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’ve got the funniest look on your face.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I gotta talk to you. I want you to tell me
something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife
doesn’t care, but I’m in a delicate condition.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now,
stay there.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All right… shoot! I mean… what’s on your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: You don’t need to tell me you’re tough. I
heard about you. I’m Joe Morelli.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve never heard about you.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I didn’t knock Julia off.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All right - you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I haven’t seen her in three months. We were
all washed up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why tell me?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I wouldn’t have any reason to hurt her. She
was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim – he
got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn’t, so he put the finger on
me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s all swell. Only you’re peddling your
fish in the wrong market. I’ve got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Listen. “Studsy” Burke told me you used to
be O.K. That’s why I’m here. Do they….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How is Studsy? I didn’t know he was out of
stir.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: He’s all right. He’d like to see you. But
listen… What’s the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it
just something else to pin on me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’d tell you if I knew. But I’m not in this.
Ask the police.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: That’d be very smart. That’d be the
smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain’s been in a hospital
three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have
me come in and ask questions. They’d like it right down to the end of
their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you’re on
the level. Be on the level.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I am on the level. If I knew anything
I’d….</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is your party.</p>
<p><strong>guild’s voice</strong>: Open up. Police.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: You two-timing –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nora…..Nora!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I did. She was in the line of fire. Hand me
that bottle. Better get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You darn fool – you didn’t have to knock me
out. I knew you’d take him, but I wanted to see you do it!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: There’s a gal with hair on her chest.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick… you’re…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s all right. It just grazed me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Someone get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s one coming.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, quick – get into bed. Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure – I don’t even feel it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’ll get some towels.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Well, it was close, but you’re all right.</p>
<p><strong>morelli’s voice</strong>: Tough luck.</p>
<p><strong>policeman’s voice</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll be all right. Don’t let’s fuss till the
doctor comes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’d you people happen to pop in?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: We hear this is getting to be sort of a
meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we’ll stick around in
case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him… …sneak in and we
decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. I might not have been shot.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: We were looking for this bird.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: That little rat Nunheim –</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Shut up! This guy a friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I never saw him before.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What’s he want of you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wanted to tell me he didn’t kill Julia
Wolf.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What’s that to you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What’d he think it was to you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ask him. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I’m asking you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Keep on asking.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not without a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: So you say - Go on, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Listen, Mr. Charles. I guess we’re both of us
going about this wrong. I don’t want to get tough with you, and I guess
you don’t want to get tough with me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s another one I can’t answer right now.
Maybe it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s that man doing in my drawers?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Here you are, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Have you got a pistol permit?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: That’s all right. We’re married.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: This gun yours?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Who’s is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll have to try to remember.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Okay. There’s plenty of time. I guess we got
to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We’ll come up
tomorrow when you’re feeling better. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I wish that doctor’d come. How do you
feel?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’ll be here. Give him time to get his
trousers on. Where’s Asta? Asta! Asta!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re a fine watch dog.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He’s got more sense than you have. Thank
Heaven you’re not on this case.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: On it! I’m in it … They think I did it!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is the nicest present I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I never saw that before.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: No. It’s a Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who gave it to you?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You must admit I have good taste.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Finished with these?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. I know all they know about the murder.
And I’m a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I read you were shot five times in the
tabloids.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s not true. He never came near my
tabloids. That’s one thing I always protect… my tabloids.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello… send him up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Season’s Greetings. The Mallorys. I forgot all
about them.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Aren’t you hot in that?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m stifling, but it’s so pretty. The
Kirbys.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is that another Christmas present?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did I give it to you?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m spoiling you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! “Will you
take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with
Herbert Macaulay”.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s see. Where’s it from?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Philadelphia. Then he didn’t do it, did he,
Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He wouldn’t ask you to handle it if he were
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh take it! Please take it!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, hello. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Good morning. I’m afraid this isn’t a very
“Merry Christmas” for you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, he’s sitting up.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I hate to bother you when you’re laid
up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Asta! Asta! Come here.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Asta - don’t bother Mr. Macaulay.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: What a delightful toy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, it’s a fire hydrant.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes. It’s Asta’s Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I got word from Wynant this morning…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: What are the chances of getting you to do
what he wants?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Slim.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, please, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Would it help any if I could persuade him
to meet you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It might.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: He gave me a code message to insert in the
Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It wouldn’t hurt to put it in.</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I’ve done that already. He should appear,
you know. It doesn’t look well… his staying away at a time like
this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello…. oh, just a minute. Police
department?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: Hello…. Where? In Allentown. Yes… When is
the next train? Right - I’ll get that. Wynant’s tried to commit suicide.
They want me to come down and identify him. I guess this changes the
whole story, doesn’t it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I
had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you’d be able to clear
him. I thought that Mimi…. the way she acted… I was sure that…. Oh,
well, well… it’s no use thinking of it now. I’m sorry to have wasted so
much of your time.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, that’s that. Stay there, Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s not going to hurt me to get up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You talk as if I were Asta.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the
rugs.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted?
So’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The mystery’s all gone. And I wanted you to
find out who did it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But Wynant — ?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t believe he did it.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No reason. Just a hunch. But I’m going to find
out. I’m tired of being pushed around.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, Watson, we’re going places.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Good morning –</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Good morning, Lieutenant - Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You oughtn’t to play this trick on me.
Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you
those questions.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You mean about that gun?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: That ain’t a gun any more. The firing pin’s
busted - the - Don’t waste time talking about that.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on
this case?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Man to man, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But he’s interested!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I don’t mind telling you I’d rather have you
working with us than against us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So would I.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: It’s a bargain then. Anything you want to
know?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about the suicide?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Oh, that’s a phoney. The men didn’t even have
to go down.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought it might be. From now on, they’re
going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is
Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Do you think that Wynant did it?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Looks like he planned, something. He shut up
his apartment and his shop.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’ve been there?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Yeah. Couldn’t find a thing. This is the way
we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia’s apartment. He finds Morelli there…
sees she’s two- timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don’t
want to do anything then…. Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He
don’t let his lawyer know anything has happened… he lets him go ahead
and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will
think it’s all blown over. Then, when she don’t expect it… he lets her
have it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No proof?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Nothing yet to cinch it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: For one thing, he was too absent- minded to
hold a grudge.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Who’s your candidate?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I haven’t got that far yet. But I don’t think
that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: They’re all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy,
Dorothy, Macaulay… even Morelli… we had to let him go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about Jorgensen?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I’ll check on that. I’m afraid this is kinder
dull for you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Dull… I’m sitting on the edge of my chair!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about this Nunheim?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Oh, he’s all right. We know all about him. He
does a little stooling for us every once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Did you know he was hanging around Julia?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s holding out on you.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Let’s go and see. Taxi!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This may be a little rough - you’d better let
us go alone.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Catch me letting you go alone!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Grant’s Tomb.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim’s voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: I wasn’t expecting you, Lieutenant. You
said you’d phone.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Have a shot?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What’s the idea of telling me you just knew
the Wolfe girl by sight?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: That’s all I did, Lieutenant. That’s the
God’s truth. Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like
that when I saw her, but that’s all I knew her. That’s the truth. All
right. Put your mouth in and I’ll pop a tooth out of it.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: Is that so!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Cut it out. We didn’t come here to watch you
two rough-house.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: She drives me nuts. She’s been ragging me
all day.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Maybe if you quit running around after other
women you wouldn’t have so much trouble with this one.</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: That’s a lie, Lieutenant… Anybody that says
that is a liar.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Want to take a poke at him?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: I didn’t mean you, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, now – she can’t hear you -</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Well… You know how it is. A guy knocking
around….</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You’d done better to have told me that in the
beginning. Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: You don’t think I had anything to do with
it?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Marian!</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I don’t like crooks and even if I did, I
wouldn’t like crooks that are stool pigeons, and if I did like crooks
that are stool pigeons, I still wouldn’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Marian! Marian! Don’t go! I’ll behave! I’ll
do anything! Don’t go, Marian!</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Let me go! Let me bring her back. I can’t
get along without her. I’ll bring her right back and I’ll tell you
anything you want to know. Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Sit down! We didn’t come here to watch you
and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the
girl was killed?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: I can’t remember offhand, Lieutenant. Maybe
I was over at Charlie’s shooting pool. Maybe I was here. She’d
remember.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: How’d you like to be thrown in the can on
account of not remembering?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Just give me a minute…. I’ll remember. I’m
not stalling, Lieutenant. You know I always come clean with you. Gee,
it’d serve me right if you had pinched me… that’s the afternoon I was….
wait, I’ll show you…!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Well, what’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think we’re on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Who’re you calling?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m calling your office so you can send out a
man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Trail him! Trail who?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Nunheim!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Bill, tell the boys to pick up Nunheim. He
just left here - went out the fire escape What’s funny about that?</p>
<p><strong>nunheim</strong>: Listen. They been questionin’ me again.
Asking me what more I know. Where I was that day…. Wait a minute. I
ducked out on ‘em. Now if you want me to play dumb, I want fi’ thousand
more… Fi’ grand and I’ll skip town today…. Where? O.K… Right away… See
that you’re there and have it with you.</p>
<p><strong>insert – a bundle of clothes – all that is left of
one</strong>: ARTHUR NUNHEIM!</p>
<p><strong>nick’s voice</strong>: “Arthur Nunheim – Honorary member”</p>
<p><strong>camera pulls back rapidly now to reveal guild’s office
at</strong>: POLICE HEADQUARTERS.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Find out about that bullet yet?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And how are your folks?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: How are you? – No, we didn’t get a thing.
It’s your wife.</p>
<p><strong>nora.</strong>: Well, I’ve got something, Lieutenant. I’ve
been doing a little detective work of my own. That flat foot I married
thinks he’s smart – but I’m one jump ahead of him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Um?</p>
<p><strong>nora’s voice</strong>: Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>nick)</strong>: How’s Grant’s tomb?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s lovely. I’m having a copy made for you
–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can’t hear you – little lou – We’ll be right
up! She’s up at Mimi’s. Jorgensen has disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris may be at the club – or somewhere – I
don’t see that it’s important –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You should have told them he’d
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: But he has nothing to do with it!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s not for you to decide. Everybody’s
under suspicion - especially running off like this – The police will
want his description. Is this a picture of him?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I tell you – he didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They’ll want more than your word for that.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: All right, then – I’ll tell them who did do
it!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: And I’ll give then proof!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dorry!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can’t help it. You don’t know…..</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Darling, you can’t go through any more of
this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we’ll go out
to my family’s in the country.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’ve got to get your mind off this.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You’re sweet, but the only thing that you
can do for me is to go.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And don’t ever try to see me again.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please! You can’t get mixed up in this.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you think I care</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You don’t understand. You don’t know what’s
going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I only know I want to marry you… right now,
and –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can’t marry you! I can’t ever marry
you!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How would you like to have a couple of
little murderers for your children? It’d be fun, wouldn’t it? Maybe
they’d murder each other… keep it all in the family. That’s what Father
should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert… then we wouldn’t
have had this to go through.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re talking like a crazy person,</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why not? I am crazy….the whole family’s
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dorothy…. listen to me. I love you. Don’t you
understand that? I love you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy’s voice</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Sleuthing isn’t all fun, is it? I feel so
sorry for that poor girl -</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Get anything?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s ready to talk. It won’t do any harm,
though - to find out where he is.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: You know, you’re wrong about all of your
children being murderers… I’ve studied the Mendelian Law of inheritance
and their experiments with sweet peas, and according to their findings…
and they’ve been pretty conclusive… only one out of four of your
children will be a murderer. So the thing for you to do would be to have
just three children… … no, no. That might not work The first one might
be the bad one. I’ll have to look that up.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You needn’t look it up. I’m not going to
get married and I’m not going to have any children. From now on, I’m
just out for the ride!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I took this from her hand. It’s Mr. Wynant’s
watch chain. I wanted to protect him.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles? He
killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Fifty will still get you a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: This is enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Calling all cars - calling all cars -
cover all</p>
<p><strong>newsboys</strong>: “Extra – extra – Wynant wanted in second
murder –” “Five Star Final” – Wynant’s ex- wife produces murder evidence
– ” “Extra - extra – double murder charge against Wynant –”</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I wish they’d stop that. It makes me fidgety.
Do you think they’ll find him, Nick? He must be in New York…. Where do
you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m going to take Asta for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: He’s just been for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re going sightseeing – aren’t we, Asta?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What’s that? What are you up to? Nickie - what
is this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Looks like a hold-up!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve got hunch. I’m going down to look at
Wynant’s shop, I want to find out why it’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why shouldn’t be close it? He went away.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He went away lots of times when I knew him -
but he never closed his shop. I’ve got a hunch something is up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You mean, he might be hiding there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know… This thing has got my goat. I’ve
got to find out.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick - I won’t have you going down there.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Say you’re the one who got me in this!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I know but this is different. He’s a crazy
man. He might kill you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll be all right. I’ve got Asta to protect
me.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Go on - go on - see if I care. But it’s a
dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a
widow.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You wouldn’t be a widow long.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You bet I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not with all your money!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You dog!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Goodbye, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nickie, take care of yourself won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure I will.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Don’t say it that way. Say it as if you meant
it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why, I believe the little woman cares.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I don’t care - I’m just used to you, that’s
all – If you let anything happen to him, you’ll never wag that tail
again!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You don’t want me to wait, do you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Well …. good luck!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ready? Well, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You keep quiet now. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, come along, then…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re not a Scottish Terrier. You’re a police
dog. New cement.</p>
<p><strong>crane shot – flight of stairs leading to wynant’s
office</strong>: ON SECOND FLOOR.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Lieutenant Guild, please… John? This is
Charles. I’m up in Wynant’s shop. Well, I’ve found something… it’s a
body.</p>
<p><strong>nick’s voice</strong>: Stick ’em up!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t make a move or that dog will tear you to
shreds!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on out, now. He won’t hurt you. Back to
your old tricks, eh, Tanner?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No, Mr. Charles.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I had a key. I worked here… till they closed
the shop.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You worked here?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as
bookkeeper.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, that’s a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When
were you ever a bookkeeper?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That time you sent me up last … I learned
book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me
somewhere’s.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Somewhere’s where they might go out and leave
the safe open?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that
safe. Them bonds that were missing… Julia took them.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Trying to put it off on her?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Mr. Charles - she did - that’s why he got
sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles – I did do a little
chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn’t want
him to find out and come after me -</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can save that and tell it to the police.
They’ll be here in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Police!</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You didn’t know anything about all this?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No, sir….</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Take him down to the can. I’ll see him
later.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I wonder what Wynant had against this one?
Quick lime. Well at least the clothes weren’t touched.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Mind if I take those out, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just rolled them up and threw them in.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Lucky thing for us they weren’t in that
lime.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Extraordinarily lucky.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: No - no identification - Must have weighed
two hundred and fifty if he weighed an ounce.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Here’s something, Bob comes into the scene. He
hands Guild a walking stick. Guild takes it and examines it.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Rubber tip. He must have been lame.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who wouldn’t be…. carrying that weight
around.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Standing straight he’d be about five foot,
eleven, wouldn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>doctor’s voice</strong>: About. There is a belt attached to
the trousers -</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: “D.W.R.” That case you worked on… the guy who
threatened to kill Wynant… what what was his name?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Rosebreen.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Could this be him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I never saw him. I don’t think anyone saw
him.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: He said Wynant tried to steal an
invention.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail…</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Just the same, Wynant wouldn’t mind having
him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body’d been
here, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: I can’t say offhand. At least a couple
of months…</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Couple of months. That’s just when he closed
the shop. The way I figure it is… he kills this guy and plants him here.
Julia knows about it, so he kills her. And Nunheim caught him at that,
so he he had to bump off Nunheim. Well, we’ll be going along. You done a
swell job. You wouldn’t like to pay me that hundred now?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wait ’till you catch Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: You can take that out to the car.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Going to run him through the fluoroscope?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you mind if I come down and see it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m very interested in that body.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Give my best to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m a ‘de-tect-uf’.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton’s voice</strong>: There’s the bullet he was killed
with. See?</p>
<p><strong>nick’s voice</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: Oh, just an old piece of shrapnel.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Shrapnel!</p>
<p><strong>dr. walton</strong>: Must have been in the war. That might
account for the cane and his limp.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes… yes.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hey… doggie, doggie. Look down at the
body! Look down at the body! Now, Mr. Charles –</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Get that out of here.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Just one family group. Sob Sister It’d
be lovely for the woman’s page.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: Have the police got any idea where
Wynant is?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Do you think they’ll I find him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I know they will.</p>
<p><strong>3rd reporter</strong>: Got anything else to say about the
case?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. It’s put me way behind in my
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: What about this Rosebreen?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry. Don’t know a thing.</p>
<p><strong>2nd reporter</strong>: Come on, let’s get it in. Thanks,
Nick.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: What’s your next step, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Right back to California. We’ve got to go home
and rest up from our vacation.</p>
<p><strong>1st reporter</strong>: We’ll see you before you go.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Back to California</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My soul, woman. I give you three murders and
you aren’t satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I want you to stay and find Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I did find him!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He was down in the shop.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It was his body that was buried there.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick, you’d better lay off that liquor.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Wynant’s body?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yup. Don’t you want something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But they all said it was Rosebreen’s.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s what they think… Guild and all of them.
They take it for granted that it’s just another of Wynant’s victims.
Guild’s hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That’s all that
troubles him.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What makes you so sure it’s Wynant’s body?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Several things. Hello, Fred. We’re hungry
again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Nick, you’ll drive me crazy. What things?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What things made you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were
carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The
person who killed him counted on one thing… that all skeletons look
alike.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Well, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You don’t get another swallow ’til you really
open up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in
his shin. It often bothered him. So I looked for it and I found it.
Gimme.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: How long has he been dead?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Couple of months anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Then he couldn’t have committed those other
murders.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Smart gal.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. Nobody but you.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’m going to tell her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey… hey. Don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: But the poor kid’s going crazy. She’d rather
know her father was dead than that…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can’t help it. I can’t tell a soul. I didn’t
even tell Guild.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I
don’t want to go off half-cocked.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m going to get the real murderer. I’ve got
an idea. Want to see me take him?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Got a nice evening dress?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Now Nick, what’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Got a nice evening dress?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I’ve got a lulu – why?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m going to give a party, and invite all of
the suspects.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: The suspects! They won’t come.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, they’ll come. I’ll have Guild issue the
invitations.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Who do you think did it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mimi…</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Mimi!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner…..</p>
<p><strong>what were</strong>: you doing on the ninth of June?</p>
<p><strong>head waiter</strong>: Shall I serve dinner now?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just a minute -</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We got ’em. Picked ’em up at the
Pennsylvania Station. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello, Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Hello, Nick! And a party - celebrating
father’s third murder -</p>
<p><strong>mimi’s voice</strong>: Dorothy!</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And cocktails!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why the bags?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: None of your business.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: They were trying to make a get- away,
Quinn We were doing nothing of the sort. What’s the idea of this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Didn’t he… …give you my invitation?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You can’t get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re perfectly right. Take the gentleman’s
coat and bag.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: This is a pretty dead bunch, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re high enough.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You know, you interrupted me at a very
important point in my life. I was about to take my first false step.
Come on, Quinny. Let’s dance -</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No - I need you here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If I stay, I know I’ll take a poke at him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then I insist that you stay.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: I want some more of that tiger milk.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: I think somebody could do something with
that girl if they took hold of her right.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Yeah - by the throat!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I think we may as well sit down.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: I guess all the suspects are here.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more
to come.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: They’ll be here. Don’t worry. My men are
picking them up.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re a great help to a hostess. I wish I
always had you for my dinner parties.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m Nick Charles. How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Chris, where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>plain-clothesman</strong>: Sorry we’re late. But they had to
break down the door.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Won’t you come in?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mr. Jorgensen, you sit next to Andrew, and
Mrs. Jorgensen on your right.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m Mrs. Jorgensen.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Put it over there. I was Mrs. Jorgensen
before you were.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mimi…. you’re here on my right.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You give such charming parties,
Mr. Charles.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Charles.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I can’t wait any longer. Tell me, do you think
one of them did it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I wish you’d tell me who.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wish you’d tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: This is all very pleasant but why are
here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ve got some very important news - I’ve seen
Wynant.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You did!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: That’s nothing. I saw him myself.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You did… where?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Last night. He came to see me at my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, did he? What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: He didn’t say very much. Wanted to know how I
was and how the children were.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: What kind of clothes was he wearing?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt
and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Tell ’em.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I saw him too… he was wearing a green suit
with a white tie…</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What are you talking about, Gilbert? You
weren’t there!</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: know. But I saw him -</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Where did you see him?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I was gazing in my crystal.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m afraid you’re lying, Mimi. You see, I
really did see Wynant last night.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me? …. Why didn’t you
hold him?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Because I found out for certain that he didn’t
commit the murders.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He didn’t do it – Nick!</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Together. Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Do you mean to say…? Etc.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Let him have his say out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping
Wynant?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: She don’t say she is, but I figure she is
-</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: Once I wanted five grand – Cash -</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thank you. Now I’ll tell you why I know Wynant
didn’t commit those murders - Three months ago - the night that he
caught you in Julia’s apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating
him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man
was…. Tanner, don’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m sorry. Tanner, don’t you want some
wine?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No… no.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re going to drive me crazy!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s see… where was I? Oh, yes. He went to
find the man. That man was desperate! He knew that he was caught dead to
rights – and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way
out. He killed Wynant. It’s terrible to tell you this way but your
father’s dead, Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He’s been dead for three months.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Darling, don’t cry. Please. I know it’s
terrible. But isn’t it really better this way?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh, Andy, Andy!</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’d better take her home. Your home.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Come on, darling.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If she’s going wrong now, she’s going wrong
right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think we need you any more now. I’m
deeply sorry that I spoiled your trip.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, everybody. Eat up. You’re not
eating.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Because I don’t believe that Clyde’s dead!
Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So I did. I saw him lying buried in his
shop.</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: You mean that body—–?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –was Wynant’s.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Perfectly absurd.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And the murderer is right here in this room
tonight… he’s sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: You’re not going to pin this one on me.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: What am I? The fall guy?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hope you won’t let this news spoil your
dinner. Nice food, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: It’s the best diner I ever listened to -</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: You’re not going to keep us in the dark,
are you? Tell us – who is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know. But I thought if we all had a
little get-together we might be able to find out. I’ll tell you as much
as I know. Go right on eating. This murderer is a very clever. He
studied this thing out very carefully. You’d understand that, wouldn’t
you, Gilbert?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: What? Yes - no -</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He planned the whole thing beautifully. After
he killed Wynant he wired Macaulay, using Wynant’s name and told him to
shut up the shop. He destroyed all of Wynant’s clothes, with the
exception of his watch chain. He figured that some day that might come
in handy. Then he took Wynant’s body and buried it in the shop with
another man’s clothes to throw us off the track. He even put a belt
buckle with an “R” on it, hoping that we’d think it was Rosebreen – an
old enemy of Wynant’s who dropped out of sight years ago. Morelli -
would you mind holding your knife another way? You’re worrying
Gilbert.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: If that knife is missing, I’ll look for it in
your back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a
brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.
Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner
guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant’s name, so that Macaulay
would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay –
Do you remember?…. the first day that you came to see me… he telephoned
that he was in town?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: But it must have been Wynant. I should
have known if it weren’t his voice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh he as clever about that. He called when you
were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that
you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was
afraid that Julia would break down and tell… so he went to Julia and
killed her and left Wynant’s watch chain in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Why are you saying it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s the only way it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: I hope you’re well.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant
was established as being in town. The watch chain was handed over….
…with a slight delay…to the police. The only hitch was a man named
Nunheim who had found out something. Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep
his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him
off.</p>
<p><strong>marian</strong>: And I don’t blame you.</p>
<p><strong>morelli</strong>: What do you say that to me for?</p>
<p><strong>guild</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You see, he’d been very clever. Everybody,
even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he
was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The
telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen
Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is
the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.
Mimi, who was it that told you to say you’d seen Wynant?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Nobody told me. I did see him!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that
story?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: It isn’t a story - it’s true. I did see
Wynant. He’s not dead.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re lying, Mimi. But then, you’d do
anything for money. You’re getting a good price for saying you saw
Wynant and you figure you won’t get anything if he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m lot going to stay here to be insulted

<p><strong>nick</strong>: Macaulay, you drew up Wynant’s will. Mimi was
cut off, wasn’t she, if she re-married?</p>
<p><strong>macaulay</strong>: I have no right to answer that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about it, Tanner. Isn’t that the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she
re-married, all the money was to go to the children.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You shouldn’t let that keep you from telling
truth, Mimi. Mrs. Jorgensen - Were you ever divorced from Chris
Jorgensen?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So you see, Mimi, under the law, you haven’t
re-married. You’re still one of the heirs. What are you holding out for?
A few crummy dollars that that man gave you when you can get the whole
estate? Remember the other two who were in with him on this… Julia and
Nunheim. When he thought they might spill something he bumped them off.
You ought to know damn well that he’s not going to take any chances on
you. What do you want to do? Be next on his list?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: You dirty son of a b—– !</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do you want me to do? Wrap him in
cellophane?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: To you two.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And to you two too.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Come!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Your room’s ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks. You can take Asta now.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: You’re going to your nice little bed in the
baggage car.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Shall I keep them fresh for you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Please, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Might as well set it ahead now.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Gracious! One o’clock. We’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can never thank you enough for all you’ve
done.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Goodnight. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I thought they’d never leave.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought you’d never leave.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Asta – meet Fifi –</p>
