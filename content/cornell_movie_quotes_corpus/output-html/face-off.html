<p><strong>archer</strong>: Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
Intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: No, sir, nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get them on the phone – now. What about
S.I.S. and our airport teams?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We’ve had everything from psychics to
satellites on this. Even if Castor was here… he must have slipped the
net by now…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s here! And we’re going to keep looking
until we find him!</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Jon, these people have been working round the
clock – you gotta cut them some slack…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’ll cut them some slack when I cut myself
some slack.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus in the
labyrinth – where’s the men’s room?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: This area is off limits, Padre. How did you
get in that room?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay… I have a confession to make, but you
aren’t gonna like it. I was planting a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Bomb?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You know – boom – Oh, never mind…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ve never enjoyed ‘The Messiah.’ But your
voice makes even a hack like Handel seem like a genius.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: … I don’t have time to get a warrant from
some hung-over judge. Just give me the go-ahead, Victor, and I promise –
as soon as this is over – you can brand my butt with the Fourth
Amendment.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Sir, your wife’s on line one… S.I.S. on
two…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Tell her to hang on –</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: A jet was chartered at Anderson Airfield.
Guess who just showed up to pay for it? Pollux Troy.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Scramble the Reaction Team – we’re moving
out. And get one of our people on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: But there’s still no sign of Castor…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Where one brother goes, the other’s sure to
follow…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You’re 26 minutes late. The casing didn’t
fit – right? I knew that cheap-shit Dietrich would rip us off…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Oh, God – !</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I forgot to turn the damn thing on!</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You’re kidding, right? He’s kidding… … are
you fucking kidding!?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Bro – everything went fine.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: I hate when you call me bro.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Thanks for babysitting.</p>
<p><strong>lunt</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ll contact you when we get the rest of the
money. Oh, and stat away from downtown. The inversion layer’s going to
be pretty thick around the 18th.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Let’s go, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Would you like anything else?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Hell, yes… It’s the only way to fly.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s Archer. Go, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: F.B.I.! Throttle down, captain!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You’re not playing chicken with two tons of
aluminum…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>ka-chunk</strong>: Something POUNDS the jet – from above.
Castor leans out the hatch and sees…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: The horizontal elevator’s smashed! We can’t
lift off!</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Forget it – Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Wherever they put you, I’ll find a way to
get you out…</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: – not unless you want that 200 I.Q. splattered
all over the floor. We got him now, Jon.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s what you always say. Seal it off. I’m
going in.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jon, I’m getting a little annoyed by your
obsessive need to spoil my fun.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And how much will your ‘fun’ net you this
time?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’s it to you? I declare it. Here I am,
back in the States for less than a week –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re under arrest. Incredibly, you still
have the right to remain silent –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ve got something going down on the
eighteenth… it’s gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the
Pharaoh. I’ll give it up – but my brother and I have to walk.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No discussion – no deals.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’re you gonna do with me locked up?
You’ll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about
ripe by now. What’s her name, Janie?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Tell me he didn’t get away again…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Where’s my brother?! I want to see my
brother!</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: The oversight committee would’ve roasted us
for this one – thank God it paid off. Damn fine work.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Real fine, Victor. Especially the
casualties.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Classified information. No photographs.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: You okay, Jon? Then go home. Tell Eve.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hi… … What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: She complimented for her ‘F’ in history with an
‘A’ in shoplifting…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Nice stunt, Jamie. You break the law and I’m
expected to ignore it?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: That’s right – it’s all about you. Don’t even
ask me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Okay. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Like you’d ever fucking believe me!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you
tried.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why won’t she even talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Maybe because you taught her never to speak to
strangers. I’m sorry… that wasn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ve got patients waiting. Try again, Jon. She
hates you – but she needs you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – what is it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Is it – him? It’s… it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m going to make everything up to you and
Jamie. I’ll put in for a desk job. We’ll go away, get counseling –
anything you want. This time, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Print, please.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Much appreciated. Now let’s get back to
work, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Is that stick ever gonna fall out of his
ass?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The C.I.A. sent this over. What should I
do with it?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Send it back and tell them to stop wasting
the taxpayers’ money. Anything else, Miss Brewster?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Four years – and he still calls me ‘Miss
Brewster.’</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How’s Loomis?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: He needs some surgery, but he’s going to be
okay. That’s the good news…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: … Brodie and Miller from Special Ops need to
see you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I don’t have time for those cloak and dagger
guys.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: You better make time, Jon. We found this in
the jet wreckage – among Pollux Troy’s effects…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Porcelain casing… Thermal cloak…
Undetectable payload.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Powerful enough to flatten ten city
blocks.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: ‘Worse than anything God ever dumped on the
Pharaohs.’ Get Pollux Troy. Now.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to me…
a mental exercise. I never built it…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: He’s hooked up to a full-spectrum
polygraph.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Pollux is a manipulative psychopath. He can
control his heartbeat, his sweat glands, his blood pressure…</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Jon, I trust your instincts, I always have.
But D.C. wants more evidence. And frankly, so do I.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’ll get all the evidence you need when
ten thousand people die.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: We’ll get a team right on it. But we can’t
evacuate the city on what amounts to a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That bomb has been built, it’s out there
somewhere and it’s going to detonate…</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Didn’t Castor give any clue where the bomb
might be?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Only one person knows – his brother Pollux.
And he’ll keep his mouth shut until it blows.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: We could plant an agent in his cell – get
him to spill the location.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Pollux is way too paranoid. The only person
he’d talk to about that bomb is Castor himself. And dead men can’t
talk.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: There might be a way around that…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why are you keeping him alive? As long as
he’s breathing, he’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Relax, he’s a turnip.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: We can arrange for you to enter Erewhon
Prison – as Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: I think I’d better answer that question.
Malcolm Hoag. I run the Physiological Camouflage Unit for Special
Ops.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: But you don’t know what he can do. Physical
augmentation; enhancement surgery…</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: … He can disguise a compromised agent or
alter the likeness – even the voice – of a government witness.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Let me show you how it’s done. I think you’ll
recognize our patient…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: With our new generation of anti-
inflammatories, healing is accelerated from weeks to days. By his next
paycheck, he won’t even remember which ear he lost. Your situation,
however, would be a little less permanent…</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: – and a lot more classified.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: This’ll fool Pollux.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: That is a state-of-the-art morpho- genetic
template. The inside can be built to match the exact shape of your
skull; the outside – exactly like Castor’s. Then we fit his face right
on top –</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: – and you become him.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re talking about removing the guy’s
face?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Borrowing, Jon. The procedure’s completely
reversible.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: One way or the other – the mission ends on
the eighteenth.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: You know Castor better than anyone. You’ve
lived and breathed him for years – hell, you even look a little like
him.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Find yourself another lab-rat.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: If you don’t do this – Castor will beat us
again. He’ll beat you again…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: I don’t think that went very well.</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: Trust us, Doc…</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: … he’ll jerk around. Then he’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m in a hurry, Dietrich. So you’ve only got
ten seconds to go through your usual litany of lies, empty threats, and
moronic denials. Then I’m coming over there –</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: If you’re in such a fucking hurry – why
are you wasting your time with me? I’m just an art dealer.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re a dealer, all right: technical
secrets, munitions… explosives.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: You’ve never proven any of that. And when
my bitchy, never-been- laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here, she’s going
to…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Time’s up.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: The only ticking bomb I see is inside his
head. He’s getting worse, Tito.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Don’t worry, sir. It’s all an act…</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: … Okay! Castor called me but I blew him
off… I swear I never saw him. And I don’t know anything about any
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Let him go, but I want him watched… Who’s
next?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Just Dietrich’s sister…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: When was the last time you saw Castor
Troy?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Who cares? He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Look, I’m clean. I teach kids now –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Sasha – you are a felon, on probation for
harboring Castor Troy. So it’s in your best interest to cooperate. Would
you like your son put in a foster home?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: No, but I’m sure you’d love it – you sick
bastard.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: When was the last time you saw Castor
Troy?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I haven’t seen him for years.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What about Lazarro?</p>
<p><strong>brodie</strong>: No way – the red tape alone would take a
month. This is a black-bag operation – completely off the books.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: If you need him, Tito can help you prepare.
But you know the drill: You can’t tell anyone – not the Director, not
your wife… nobody.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I was dreaming…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Something good?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m not sure… you were flying this weird old
stunt plane… doing flips… walking on the wings… I was watching from the
ground – when you fell. You had a parachute, but you wouldn’t open
it.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Did you catch me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know… Maybe because you’ve never needed
my help.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Come on, you made that up, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … Maybe I did… … maybe I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’s all right, Jon.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: After all these years, I still can’t get it
out of my head – an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And you wouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Things will get better now that you’re home.
Everything will be better – now that… that man is finally out of our
lives.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: … If I had to do something to find some
closure… I should do it, shouldn’t I?… No matter how crazy?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, God – you’re going on assignment again…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: One last time. And while I’m gone, I want
you and Jamie to go to your mother’s. It’s important…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You said you’d be here! You promised! What
could be more important than that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I can’t tell you… except only I can do
it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You want me to tell you it’s okay to leave?
Okay, go on! Go!</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Jon, this is goddam insane. You can’t do
it.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You haven’t got a chance in hell of fooling
Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24- hour hard-on.
He’s nothing like you –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t worry… If Hoag can do half what he
claims, I’ll get Pollux to talk.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: It’s not that simple, Jon… Becoming another
person – especially him – nobody can come all the way back from that…
not even you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Keep this for me.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Let’s walk through it, Jon. Your blood types
are different, but we can’t do anything about that. Otherwise, nature is
cooperating nicely. The height difference is negligible – within 1/2 an
inch. Eye color – almost a perfect match. Penis size, flaccid,
essentially the same – Substantial.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Hairline will be adjusted with laser-shears…
micro-plugs for the body hair… the teeth will be bonded to match
Castor’s…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: How about an abdominoplasty?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Abdomino – what?</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: A tummy tuck. On the house.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Nice catch. But you used the wrong hand.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Shoot me. Shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You want to be Castor Troy? If you hesitate
for a breath, you’re finished! Now – shoot me! Kill me!</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You can’t do it… because Castor is tougher
than you…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Let’s see if I missed anything before I get my
hands really dirty.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: You realize this has to be removed. Then here
we go, Commander. Through the Looking Glass…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Make sure you get everything – I’ll need to
study the tape before the reverse surgery.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Vault it.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Jon – are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Okay… I’m okay. But my voice… I still sound
like me.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: I implanted a micro-chip onto your larynx.</p>
<p><strong>castor archer</strong>: Okay, I’ve got a Okay, I’ve got a
confession to make, but confession to make, but you aren’t gonna like
you aren’t gonna like it… it…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: We’re down to 72 hours. Let’s call Lazarro.
Castor Troy just came out of his coma.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Watch this hard-case – he’ll bite your nuts
off if he gets the chance!</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: What a week for Archer to go on a training
op. Maybe we should try to contact him.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Forget it. He’s knee-deep in Georgia swamp by
now.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t forget – I ordered a kosher meal…</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You are now an Erewhon inmate – a citizen of
nowhere. Human rights zealots, the Geneva convention and the P.C. police
have no authority here. You have no right… When I say your ass belongs
to me – I mean it. Bend over.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Step into them.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Don’t sniff ’em, you perv. Just step into
them.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: They’re too tight.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: So’s a noose. Now keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: The prison’s one big magnetic field. The
boots’ll tell us where you are – every second of the day. 201 to
Population.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: I’ve got fifty bucks says you’re dead by
dinner. Don’t disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>little man</strong>: Hey, Castor – remember me?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Fabrice Voisine… sure, I – – I believe Jon
Archer busted you for poisoning five members of the the Canadian
parliament?</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: Those scumbags should never have voted
against the Quebecois. We heard you got wasted.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do I look wasted – asshole?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Central. I have a disturbance in population.
Go to lock down –</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Hold that lock down.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Never – in – the – face.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Lock ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What? He started it!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: When I get out of here –</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You’ll what?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m going to have you fired.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: That’s two strikes, Dubov. One more and you
know where you’re going. Back to your ‘suites’ – or no dinner.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Hey, bro…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Pollux?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Of course it’s Pollux, what the fuck’s wrong
with you?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Lars… okay, Lunt, then. Something really
fucked-up happened… I’m in trouble… so listen very carefully…</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: What’s this about? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What do you think I want?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You realize, of course, that magnetic
humming is designed to drive us insane. If we all don’t get brain tumors
first.</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: And that same cloying Bambi tape – over and
over…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: It’s like they’re begging us to riot. Where
the fuck are we, anyway? Gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: … I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Your jumpshot has no arc. You used to
swagger… now you swish. You’re gumming that butt like a Catholic school
girl. And why do you keep picking at your finger?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I was in a coma…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: My reflexes, my senses, my memory…
everything’s jumbled. I can’t even tell you why Dubov jumped me
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You Pollinated his wife the day he was
arrested. How could forget that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’ve forgotten plenty. Look around – we’ve
screwed over half the freaks in here. What’s gonna happen to us if they
think I’ve lost it?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I need you to play big brother for once –
till I can fill in a few blanks. Think you can handle that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I know I got this on my tenth birthday. I
just can’t remember why.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Man – that was the worst day of our
lives!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Oh, God – Mom O-D’d at County General.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Retching and convulsing while those bastards
didn’t even try to save her sorry ass. You gave her mouth to mouth – man
– even then you had some constitution. Remember what you swore to me at
the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Uh – to kill the doctors?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: After that. You promised you’d always take
care of me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And I bet I kept that promise…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Only one you’ve never broken.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Screw the past. We’ve got the future to look
forward to. We still have tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: No shit… five million bucks… now those Red
Militia crackpots get to keep it.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s not the worst part.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: What’s worse than losing five million
bucks?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.
What you built was a work of art. It belongs in the Smithsonian.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Yeah – well… the L.A. Convention Center will
have to do…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Thanks, Pollux.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: ‘Thanks’? I guess they really did fuck you
up.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You have a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>impostor</strong>: What’s the matter? Don’t you like the new
me?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Castor…?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It can’t be. It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was
‘titanically remote’. Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut
off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all. By the
way, I know you don’t get the papers in here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Terrible tragedy. Hoag was such a genius –
but selfish with his artistry. I actually had to torture his assistants
to convince him to perform the same surgery on me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You killed them?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Of course I killed them, you dumb fuck.
Hoag, his staff…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Miller and Brodie –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I even paid a visit to your buddy Tito.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He doesn’t know anything about this!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Come on, Jon. I think I know you better than
that. I only wish you could have been there to see the look on his face
–</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – then again, I guess you were there. I
torched every shred of evidence that proves who you are. So swallow this
– you are going to be in here for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Castor, don’t do this –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: No discussion, Jon – no deals. Now if you’ll
excuse me, I’ve got an important government job to abuse, and a
beautiful wife to fuck. Excuse me – I mean ‘make love to.’</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s quite all right. You never know what to
expect from a psychopathic criminal…</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty
lonely now that Pollux is gone.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Pollux is – what?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Archer cut him a deal for turning state’s
evidence. He’s been released…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Walton, you have to listen to me – right
now!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Or what? You’ll have me fired? You’re
confined until I say otherwise…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jesus, what a life.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I suppose it was only a matter of time before
you forgot where we lived.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Sorry – the job’s been murder lately.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So what happened to your ‘important’
assignment?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know exactly what you always tell me:
Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It didn’t work out the way everyone thought
it would. Where are you off to?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ve got surgery.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Surgery – are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Don’t try to charm me – I’m still angry.
There’re leftovers in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Have fun at work.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What is with you?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t I usually kiss my wife?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What a dump.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: ‘… “Date-night” has been a typical failure…
we haven’t made love in almost two months…’ What a loser …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: The plot thickens.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: – I got your E-mail, Karl. That poem was
really sweet – Hang on a sec…</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: I’ll call you back. You’re not respecting my
boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m coming in, Janie.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: ‘Janie’?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I don’t think you heard me… Jamie… You have
something I want …</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Clarissa left those here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I won’t tell mom if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: When did you start smoking?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’ll be seeing a lot of changes around
here – Daddy’s a new man.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Listen, sir… we just want you to know…</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We’re all really sorry about Tito…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Yeah, well, shit happens.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: How’s our star witness?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: He hasn’t told us a damn thing except what
kind of mustard he likes on his tongue sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: If that bomb is out there – we’re almost out
of time.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Archer!</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: You made a deal with Pollux Troy? He’s ‘a
manipulative psychopath.’ Your own words, Jon!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just let me do my job, Victor.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: The job I’ve been protecting for the last
eight years. From now on, you go strictly by the book. Everything gets
cleared by me. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re supposed to be snitching – making me
look good.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: ‘Look good’? Seeing that face – I want to
vomit.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m the one who has to look at this
butt-ugly mug every time I pass a mirror. Look at my eyes, my chin, my
perfect nose – gone! Archer took my life, so I’m taking his. Bro, I’m
going straight.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Sounds like they took your brain, too?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar Hoover. Carlos
the Jackal running Interpol. Kaddafi heading the Mossad. Think of the
secrets we could sell…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: The drug agents we could expose. The movie
stars we could blackmail!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: That’s just the bottom of the food chain.
Pollux – what would happen if somebody planted a bomb on Air Force
One?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: … that somebody would get rich. And, I
suppose, the nation would be pretty pissed-off.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Pissed-off, vulnerable… looking for someone
to step in, take charge, give them hope again. What if that someone was
an F.B.I. hero? A true Boy Scout and family man – with a spotless past.
Imagine where that guy could land – if the timing’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: It’s an audacious dream, Caz. But Jon Archer
is hardly a household name.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not yet he isn’t. But after you ‘confess’ –
you’ll be a free man. And I’ll be on my way…</p>
<p><strong>bomb leader</strong>: Jesus… Any suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yeah… run</p>
<p><strong>bomb leader</strong>: It’s protected by a vibration detector…
One touch and…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Evacuate your team, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bomb leader</strong>: Sir, you can’t disarm it –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just go!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: A special privilege today: TV – by order of
Agent Jon Archer of the F.B.I…</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: That was the scene at the L.A. Convention
Center, where an F.B.I. agent is being hailed as a hero. Agent Jon
Archer disarmed a powerful bomb just seconds before it was set to
explode. Let’s get the latest from Valerie Rice…</p>
<p><strong>reporter rice</strong>: The apparent target was a group of
Supreme Court justices – due to speak here today. Mr. Archer, do you
have any idea who planted it?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: That’s classified. But if he’s listening I
have a message for him: Nice try. Now you know who’s really in
charge.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t you guys watch TV? Where’s the
parade?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – Loomis, Buzz, uh – Wanda… all of you,
thanks from the bottom of my heart. Thanks for enduring all those years
I was an insufferable boor. From now on – consider me reborn.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Stop the presses – Jon Archer found a
personality…</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Sir… the White House is calling.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jon, your career is finally taking of.
Archer. Sure I’ll hold…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Mr. President, what an honor…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: How about a game of horse?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Don’t make me beat your butt again, Dad. It’s
harmful to my developing psyche.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Afraid you’ll lose?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Try putting a higher arc on the ball… and
square your shoulders to the basket.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Gotta go. Karl’s here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t tell me you forgot. Eve – it’s date
night!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why do I feel like I’m on a blind date?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s important to keep some mystery… so
things stay… unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: ‘Unpredictable’? You’re about as unpredictable
as the tide. How long are you going to be gone this time?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Gone?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Isn’t that what all this is about? The wine,
cooking me dinner – your next assignment?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You always say that – then you leave.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I bet I deserved that. I bet Jon Archer is
the most inattentive, sexless spouse on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon, that’s not true –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Of course it’s true, but I’m trying to
change? I’m here because I want to be alone with you. I want to see the
candle- light dance in your beautiful –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – brown eyes.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I wanted it all to be just right… when I
told you about my promotion.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Well, I don’t have it yet. But Lazarro’s
getting old – he won’t be around forever. And I’m getting the itch to
move up.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon… that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: So you see, I’m not going anywhere. Unless
it’s upstairs with you…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: baby, it’s like I’m having you for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t they ever let us take off these
boots?</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: Not unless you’re sent to the ‘Clinic.’</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You mean if I get sick?</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: They don’t give two fucks about your
health. The Clinic’s where they send the real hard-cases for attitude
adjustment. Dubov just got sent down – and look at Wainwright –</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: Toughest bastard I ever saw – after you, of
course. Now he’s a fucking drool case.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>voisine</strong>: He hit a guard.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Looking for trouble, Castor?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: As a matter of fact – yes.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Where’s the mop, he puked all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: – next time, bring them in before
dinner…</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Oh happy day – Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Bite hard, scumbag, ’cause you’ll be gumming
baby food from here on out.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Get his boots, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Dubov – come on!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Come on… come on…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Last night, I thought – this isn’t my
husband.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Then I woke up in the middle of the night – and
found you passed out in the study.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I couldn’t sleep – you roll around a lot.
Anyway, I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon, you know what day it is. I know it’s
difficult for you, but we still have to go.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Can’t we skip it just this once? I gotta
‘protect and serve’, you know.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: ‘Protect and serve’ later. You’re going.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay, if you insist. But – you drive.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: So who’s this Karl creep Jamie’s been
seeing? He’s a little old for her, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know… they’re about the same ages we
were when we met. Remember the all-night dentist?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Sure, how could I forget. By the way, you
never said anything about last night…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Aren’t you going to get that?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – this is hardly the time or place.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Happy birthday, Matty.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He took our baby, Jon. He took our little
boy.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Stop crying… stop crying… stop …</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper
off!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Castor’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: He’s – what?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Somehow he escaped from Erewhon. But a prison
chopper mowed him down just off Long Beach Harbor…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where’s the body?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: It hasn’t been recovered yet.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: ‘It hasn’t been recovered yet!’ You people
have no idea who you’re dealing with! I want everyone on this, reports
on the half hour, and all leads get routed through my office. Buzz,
alert the L.A.P.D.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: L.A.P.D.? Even if he is alive, Castor isn’t
stupid enough to come back to the city.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: He’s alive – and he’s already here.
Move!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Dr. Archer please. It’s an emergency. – Her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hello, Eve – I know this sounds crazy, but –
Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How did this happen, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>iris’s dad</strong>: She fell off her Big-Wheel.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dr. Archer – your husband’s on three.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Get Child Services down here – and don’t let
her father leave. Jon? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is
your husband – isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Please, just listen! Take Jamie and go to
your mother’s in Santa Fe. Don’t tell him where you’re going – just
go.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Whoever you are – don’t call again…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I need to speak to Director Lazarro
immediately… I have information about Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: This is Jon Archer. Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Well, if you’re Jon Archer… I guess this
must be Castor Troy…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ve gotta hand it to you, Jon. You’re doing
a damn respectable job of being me. But let’s face it, we both liked it
better the way it was. So before the cops blow your brains out – why not
tell me where you are…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: If you were really me, you’d know – no
discussion, no deals.</p>
<p><strong>cholo # 1</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>cholo #2</strong>: Ten bucks he’s the guy who popped
Tito!</p>
<p><strong>cholo #1</strong>: 9-1-1? I want to report a stolen car and
don’t put me on hold!</p>
<p><strong>radio reporter</strong>: … the escapee is considered
extremely dangerous. If you have any information concerning the
whereabouts of Castor Troy…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No, Jon… you have to think like Castor.
Where would he go…?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Jon Archer… some poor schmuck’s in big
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Yeah – me.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Jesus Christ, Castor.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Drive. And punch up your cellular – I need
you to make some calls.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: You’re gonna get me busted!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re already busted, Dietrich. It’s just a
matter of time before they pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Man, when you came to me about that bomb –
I knew I should have blown you off… but that’s my fucking curse – I just
can’t say no to a friend.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You can’t say no to money.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: That’s my other curse.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re Castor Troy… This is your old crew –
you don’t take shit and you don’t take no for an answer…</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Helluva place, Dietrich. So what’s the big
surprise?</p>
<p><strong>fitch</strong>: Are you crazy? You’re going to bring the Feds
down on all of us!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Archer doesn’t want you, he wants me! But
I’m going to get him first – with your help.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: Archer’s a damn celebrity now – he’s
untouchable – and you’re radioactive.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You wanna face-off with Castor Troy? Come
on, then! Come on! ’Cause I’ve had a real bad day…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re all forgetting who the real enemy is.
Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled you in for questioning. He rattled you
so bad – you shit your Armani suit right there in the interrogation
room.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You laugh, Fitch – the way Archer laughed at
your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow
your way to freedom.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: We all have a reason to hate Jon Archer.
We all want to see him dead –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And nobody’s untouchable if we say he’s
not.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: It’s all worked out. Caz has Archer’s
routine down cold.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: We start with your basic kidnapping. Then –
a little surgery.</p>
<p><strong>fitch</strong>: Surgery?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m going to rearrange his face in a way you
won’t believe.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: You’re an evil bitch, Caz. But you’ve got
balls of titanium. Count us in.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Come on – let’s drink to it!</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: How about one of your famous toasts,
Caz?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: To old jobs, new jobs and – uh – blow
jobs?</p>
<p><strong>livia</strong>: Enough business, Caz. Let’s dance.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Sorry… I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>livia</strong>: Remember the Charger’s game, Caz? The owners
box? We did it four times.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Sure I remember… Once a quarter, right?</p>
<p><strong>livia</strong>: Caz? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: When even Castor Troy can’t handle a tab
of Quantrex… That, dear friends, is the first sorry whiff of old
age.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Sasha Hassler. Age 35. Met Castor Troy in
Austin, Texas, at Pearl Jam reunion… Uh, how you doing, baby?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: What the hell are you doing here? You’re
supposed to be dead…</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: No… Karl, please.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: My father – he’s got a gun – he’ll – he’ll
–</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That wimp won’t do shit.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What are you – stupid?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: That’s just like you. Some guy tries to rape
me – and you side with him.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Did it look like I was siding with him? Did
it? You want to play with scummy organ grinders, you better be prepared.
Do you have protection?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You mean like… condoms?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I mean like… protection.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Next time – slip it in low, then twist it –
so the wound doesn’t close.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Go on, get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: No wonder he spent all his time chasing me.
Who can deal with this family shit?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jon Archer. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: – I thought he might visit some old friends
of yours. And bro, if I didn’t know better – I’d swear this guy likes
being you…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Uh – can’t we just talk?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Talk? The only talk I ever heard from you was
‘take it off,’ ‘sit on it,’ ‘I’ll pay you tomorrow.’</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Take off the rest of those rags and get
dressed. Then get out.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Not until I finish my business with your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: I told him to keep those creeps away – but
you’re just too big an attraction. Look, if the F.B.I. finds out you’ve
been here – I’ll lose my son. So please, just go.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I know I’ve done some things that made your
life harder…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: How would you? You walked out and never
looked back.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m not the same person you remember. And
for what it’s worth, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Not a bad fit.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: They should. They’re yours.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Nice-looking kid, too</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Of course he is…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Adam, come here… I want you to meet your
father.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: We’ve got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull
out.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What makes you so sure this guy’s gonna set up
his own brother?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ve never been more certain of anything.
Get everyone in position. Remember – shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You heard the man – let’s saddle up!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Five. No one knows you’re his father. I
thought someone might want to hurt him – just to hurt you…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You know Mommy doesn’t like you playing with
these things…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You’re not holding him right… Caz…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s not my son.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Yes, he is – !</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Buzz…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Dietrich! The painting!</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Adam!</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: They’re like cockroaches!</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: If we make it, we’ll meet up at my Malibu
place. You remember it, Caz?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Off Kanan Road – I know it.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Thank you, Caz… thank you…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get the boy out of here…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s about a thousand years bad luck…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s too late, Jon. Your kid loves me. And
your wife’s an animal. Even I can’t keep up with her.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Tonight I’m going to make her come like
Niagara Falls – to celebrate your death.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Remember me? Your ‘baby brother’?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You tricked me into telling you things I
never told anyone…</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Now take it to your grave.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Pollux…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Get a medic – now!</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Forget him, sir. It’s only Pollux Troy…</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What the fuck do you think happened? Castor
Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? Go!</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Sir – you’re on the cover of Time. They’re
calling you ‘An Authentic American Hero.’</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: We were friends once, Jon, so I feel I owe
it to you – to tell you face-to-face… I don’t care how much hype you’re
getting – you’re through. After that massacre last night, I’m ordering a
full inquiry into your recent erratic – and deeply suspect –
behavior.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Me – ‘erratic’? Victor, what are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: You start meeting with Brodie and Miller.
Then they die mysteriously. Your best friend is murdered – and you don’t
seem to give a shit. Suddenly you’re smoking, drinking, acting like a
man with something to hide… Maybe you’ve been bought – maybe you’ve lost
your mind. But I promise… I’m going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay, Vic, I have a confession to make. But
you aren’t gonna like it… I’m Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: – I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Now you understand.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Cancel my four o’clock. And send for the
paramedics. Victor Lazarro’s having a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: All units. I have a confirmed code
zero-zero priority alert. Proceed at once to Parthenia Street Terminal.
That’s Parthenia at Nordhoff.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Commander, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where should I be? Where’s everyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Backing you up! Didn’t you track Castor to
the Parthenia Street Terminal?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You radioed in your personal security code.
Nobody knows that code but you.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Obviously someone else knows it! Get
everybody back to their posts – now!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you. Just don’t
scream, okay? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know you – you’re the one who called. You’re
Castor Troy. You killed my son –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – I called, but I’m not Castor. I’m your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Now, you’re going to listen. The last time
we saw each other – was in this room. We had a fight after I told you I
had to go away. My assignment – Jon Archer’s assignment – was to enter a
federal prison as Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How did he expect to do that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor’s face. He
handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow
Castor came out of his coma – and killed everyone who knew about the
mission. But not before he was transformed into me.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Dr. Archer, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: If you need hard evidence, get it. Your
husband’s blood type is O negative. Castor’s is A.B.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Remember the parachute dream? I’m falling,
Eve… I’m falling…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I want you guys here around-the- clock. And
stay off the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re all in knots. Maybe another date
night will help you relax…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Not tonight… I’m way behind in my Continuing
Ed.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You think I’ve been acting strange. Like a
completely different person.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – Yes.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay, I have a confession to make. But you
aren’t going to like it…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: And to prove it, I’m taking you and Jamie
away on a trip – right after the memorial service.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What memorial service?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Victor Lazarro had a heart seizure… right in
my office. It was horrible…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: First Tito… now Victor… … please don’t tell
me I’m going to lose you, too…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Something bit me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Probably a mosquito – I’ll close the
window.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sorry, Dr. Archer. Where are you going at this
hour?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: There’s been an emergency at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: One of us will have to escort you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Fine… But please don’t wake my husband… he’s
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Please be O-neg. Please…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Thanks for believing me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What are you doing? Where did you get that
gun?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I took it from my fake husband.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why point it at me? I’m the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know that. Maybe Jon’s already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What more proof do you need?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Tell me… tell me about the all- night
dentist.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: … I took a date out for chicken and ribs –
not knowing she was a vegetarian. When the night couldn’t get worse, she
broke her tooth on a pebble that got into her three-bean salad Somehow
she and I had fun driving around looking for an all-night dentist… And
even though it must have hurt – you still kissed me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Christ, Jon! How could you put us in this
position? Do you know – do you know what he did to me…?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Whatever happened, whatever he did – I know
it’s my fault and I know I can never make it up to you –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: But you’re damn well going to try. First – how
are we going to get you out of this?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: This will knock him out for hours.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Good. What’s his schedule tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He doesn’t tell me anymore than you ever did…
All I know is – tomorrow we’re going to Victor’s memorial service.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Victor… Tito… they both died thinking I
killed them… And in a way… I did.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – you can’t think about that now.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – What happens after the memorial?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s taking Jamie and me away.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And neither of you will be coming back.
Where’s the service?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Saint Mary’s-By-The-Sea.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hit him with a trank dart. Once he’s
unconscious – I’ll try to get to Buzz and Wanda before the security team
gets to me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What else can I do?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Think up a good excuse. I don’t want you or
Jamie anywhere near that service.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I can cover for Jamie. But if I’m not there,
he’ll suspect something… The second you make your move, all hell’s going
to break loose. If I’m there beside him – I can take charge. I’m his
wife, remember? There’s no way around it – for once, you need me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’ve always needed you…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – what are the odds?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Terrible. But it’s the best we can do with
what we have. If it doesn’t happen, take Jamie and don’t look back…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do doctors travel in packs?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Only when we’re golfing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: That’s what you’re going to explain to
me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Didn’t the police tell you? There was an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – stop it! Mr. Alandro is very ill!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not as ill as he’s going to be…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Sorry. But what’s a guy to think when his
wife runs off in the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’s my fault. I should’ve woken you up before
I left. Now please let me get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Stay here. Watch her like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: Think she knows?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Who cares? She’s going to be dead by tonight
anyway. They’re all going to be dead. The wife, the kid… and the
father.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: His ears are still ringing – but he’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: The truck’s all gassed up. Look, Caz,
there’ll be F.B.I. agents all over that place. Maybe I can talk my
brother into helping us.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: ‘Us’? No, Sasha – believe me, this isn’t
your fight.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where’s Jamie?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know. She stole fifty
dollars from my purse and took off.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Don’t act so stunned, Jon. You know how hard it
is to get that girl into a dress.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ll deal with her later.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good. Because I am fed up.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We are here to celebrate the life of Victor
Lazarro. We all know him as a man who dedicated himself to defending
this great nation – first, as a highly decorated admiral – then, as west
coast director of the F.B.I. But not all of you know what a deeply
spiritual man he was. It was his wish that his Requiem Mass be performed
in Latin. In Nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa
tremenda quando caeli movendi sunt et terra…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine… Amen.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Thanks anyway, Mom – But I wanted to be here
for you… and Dad.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: The admiral’s family will now take his ashes
to the sea…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Lars – take Jamie, bring the car around,
then meet us at that boathouse…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wanda – I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Sure… what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Never mind –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Come on, baby. I’ve got a surprise for
you.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Look who we caught creeping around – Castor
Troy.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why is he here?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Before I turn him in, I thought we’d pay him
back for everything he’s put us through…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Come on, baby. Join the fun –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Too bad. Part of me was hoping you didn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Did you really think it would be that easy,
you dumb fucks? Sorry, baby. Castor Troy is about to murder you and our
daughter… but I promise you won’t die unavenged.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: This is between you and me. Leave them out
of this.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It was between you and me. Even your little
boy – that wasn’t supposed to happen. But you couldn’t let it go.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No father could.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Appealing to my sense of ‘family’ won’t
work, Jon. I thought you knew me better than that</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I know some things that even you don’t know,
Caz. You have a son. I’ve met him. His name is Adam…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I imagine I’ve got a dozen kids – so what?
No more head games… First your wife dies. Then your daughter. Then
you.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just one big happy family…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Dietrich – Aldo – Sasha?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: That’s right, Archer. Now drop ’em.</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: Don’t fucking move…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Caz – are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re making a mistake. I’m Castor – he’s
Archer. Sasha, baby – just give me a minute to explain!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: That’s pathetic, Archer. But then, your
terrible sense of humor is legendary.</p>
<p><strong>aldo</strong>: It’s pay-back time.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Find Jamie!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jamie? Jamie!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: … Help Adam… don’t let him end up like
us…</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Sasha – !</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We heard gunshots –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wanda, I’ve got to tell you something.
Something crazy…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Give up, Castor. People are going to find
out.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not if I kill you first.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Give it here, Jamie.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No, Jamie. Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Listen to my voice, Jamie. I’m your
father.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s a trick, Jamie. I’m your father.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Shoot him, Jamie.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Jamie…</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You dunce. No kid of mine would miss so
badly.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just saving the taxpayers the cost of a
trial. So take a hike.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You’re both under arrest until a D.N.A. test
proves who’s who.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m ordering you to back off!</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Put the gun down –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: – Now!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Can’t blame me for trying.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Say goodbye to Daddy –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You ungrateful delinquent!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Give me your weapon – now!</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Who are you? Will someone please tell me
what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>boat captain</strong>: Hey – !</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You won’t shoot me, Jon. I’m unarmed…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Okay, I have a confession to make… but you
aren’t gonna like it… You’re right, I won’t shoot you. Not in the face
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’ll never be over, Jon… every time you
look in the mirror… you’ll see my face…</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You okay, Archer?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: He called you ‘Archer’ – sir.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hang on, Jon… they’re bringing in their top
surgical team from</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No life signs at all. He’s a turnip.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s what they always say…</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: I’m sorry, Eve. You can’t come. Take her
home.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: But he’s my husband!</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: But he works for us.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Will Dad be Dad again?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I hope so, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: And you guys say my life is screwed up…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: I’m sorry I shot you, Dad. Am I grounded?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I have something to ask you – to ask both of
you…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: This is Adam. He needs a place to live… just
for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How was your first day back?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Thank goodness, a human being.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: Attention all units – 211 at Pier 39.
Suspect is a white male, 30’s, 6 feet with specs, armed and very
dangerous. Heading south on Van Ness in a blue Ford sedan. Watch for
this one, fellas – he’s looney toons.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Another day, another - cop?</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: You’re making a ghastly mistake! I haven’t
been to Fisherman’s Wharf, I don’t even like fish.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Check my papers – I’m with the English
consulate – I’ve got diplomatic immunity – and you’ve - got - no -
right!</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Hello! Sorry I’m late, but there’s been a
bit of a muddle. I’m on the ninth floor of the bloody Fillmore police
station. Could you come and “bail me out” or whatever they call it?
There’s a good chap.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: – I do have something on the 26th floor
facing west – but there’s no view.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Yes – there is.</p>
<p><strong>bryce</strong>: If this guy took a shit off the London Bridge
– we’ll know about it in two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>trainee</strong>: This guy? I bet he never even said the word
shit.</p>

WEST COAST DIVISION, IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gardner</strong>: How is the “date night” idea going over
with Eve?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the
last one.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gardner</strong>: You missed the last three, including
her birthday. Your wife’s gripe sheet.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’ve been working night and day. I haven’t
had time.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gardner</strong>: You’re supposed to make time. When was
the last time you told her you love her? When was the last time you two
had sex?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: One of my informants spotted him – right
here in the city.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gardner</strong>: I just asked you about making love to
your wife, and you started talking about your job.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m not hiding in my work, if that’s what
you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>dr. gardner</strong>: You said it, Jon, not me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Jon Archer.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: Excuse me, Officer. May I have a private
word with you? I just wanted to say … Thanks for being one dumb
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lunt</strong>: Number 6 – the cue-ball.</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: 6 is tagged.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Hurry …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: It’s my brother …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Castor – !</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Go on – GO!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You won’t be using this trick on me
again.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jon, I’m getting a little annoyed by your
obsessive need to spoil my fun.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And how much will your “fun” net you this
time?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’s it to you? I declare it. Here I am,
back in the States for less than a month –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re under arrest. Incredibly, you still
have the right to remain silent –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’re you gonna do with me gone? You’ll
drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by
now. What’s her name, Janie?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Mention my family once more and you’re
dead.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You can’t kill me, Jon. I’ve got something
going this Saturday night … it’s gonna be worse than anything God ever
dumped on the Pharaohs – and only I can stop it.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You can tell me all about it – from your
prison cell.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t count on it.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Tell me he didn’t get away again …</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Jon –!</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Fine work, Jon.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Yeah, real fine. Especially all the
casualties.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: I’m complimenting you. Can’t you ever just
say “thanks”?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: … Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Try to kiss my butt just once before I’m
transferred.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Sorry, Admiral. It wasn’t mentioned in the
job description.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hey, Archer, what’s going on? How about a
statement?</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Jon – bad press means bad publicity means
budget cuts. Just have your report on my desk by noon.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Go home, Jon. Tell Eve …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hi … Where’s Jamie?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: She complimented her “D” in physics with an “F”
in grad theft auto …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Stealing a police car from a car wash! Are
you out of your mind?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: That’s right. Don’t even ask me what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Okay. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Like you’d ever believe me over a fucking
cop!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you
tried.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Everything I say is wrong. I can’t talk to
her anymore.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: She’s only 12. Some day she’ll understand that
apathy and absence are just special ways of saying “I love you.”</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Is that what you think?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon … we just remember how it used to be. You
staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m late for surgery.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So is finishing my residency and passing my
boards …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’ll make it up to you and Jamie. I’ll put
in for a desk job. This time, I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>gate guard ed</strong>: Print, please, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Much appreciated. Now let’s get back to
work, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Is that stick ever gonna fall out of his
ass?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The CIA sent this over. What should I do
with it?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Send it back and tell them to stop wasting
the taxpayers’ money. And Miss Brewster –</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Yes, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It’s against the law to smoke in a federal
building.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Three years – and he still calls me “Miss
Brewster.”</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How’s Loomis?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Apparently, fine. He’s coming into work.
That’s the good news …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Castor’s still alive – Technically. He’s a
turnip, on total life-support …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Some kind of designer toxin. Probably
biological. Definitely airborne.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: – That bomb was just a crossword puzzle to
me … a mental exercise. I never built it …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Jon, he’s hooked up to a full-spectrum
polygraph. No one has ever beaten –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I don’t care – he’s manipulating it. That
bomb has been built and it’s out there, somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: What do you expect us to do – shut down the
city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It isn’t a hunch and Castor doesn’t bluff.
It’s going to happen …</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: We can send in a plant – try to get Pollux to
spill the location.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’d see that a mile away. The only person
he’d talk to about that bomb is his brother. Unfortunately, turnips
can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: I’ll be damned. Loomis …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Which ear was it?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: The left, I think. Those surgeons in Witness
Protection can fix things nobody’s even broken yet.</p>
<p><strong>hoag’s voice</strong>: This informant marked himself for
death by testifying against a drug cartel, so he was sent to me for a
little makeover.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: A rhinoplasty here, a mentoplasty there …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: So it is possible?</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: To temporarily borrow another man’s face? Oh,
yes. I can think of only one reason why it’s never been done – – no
one’s ever asked.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: But will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Without approval – totally off the books as
you say? Commander, your proposal would cost me my job and get me
banished from every respectable medical society in the world. That’s why
I like it. But can you find a volunteer in time?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – I already have.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … I was dreaming …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Something good?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: We were back in high school. You wanted to join
the sky diving team, but I wouldn’t let you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Must’ve been after we got engaged.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Actually – in this dream – I was your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: So you had a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Totally – you were being very, very bad. You
went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn’t
open.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Were you there to catch me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know … Maybe because you’ve never
needed my help.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Five years … I still can’t get it out of my
head – an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And you wouldn’t be.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What are you saying? Oh, God – you’re going on
assignment again …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: One last time. It’s important …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You said you’d be here! You promised me – you
promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I can’t tell you … except only I can do
it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You want me to tell you it’s okay to leave?
Okay, go on! GO!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Am I crazy, Matty?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Sasha Plummer, 28, single, mother of one.
Met Castor Troy in Berkeley at a Pearl Jam reunion. Felony convictions:
two counts, drug running. She has a tattoo of a 1956 Buick on her right
ankle.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Castor himself didn’t know half this crap, and
it was his life. What do you want with the prison lay-out? That place is
so tight, you couldn’t squeeze a fart out of there.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Dietrich Hassler. 45. Biochemist. Dismissed
from the FDA on charges of …</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Jon, this is goddam insane. You can’t go
through with it. What about Eve?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: She doesn’t know – and she never will.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You haven’t got a chance in hell of fooling
Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.
He’s nothing like you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ve done my homework. I’ll get
Pollux to talk.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Either way, come Saturday morning – I’m
pulling you the hell out of there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: Let’s walk through it, Commander. Your
blood types are different, but surgically compatible. The height
difference is negligible – within 1/2 an inch. The feet are close
enough. Penis size, flaccid, essentially the same. Substantial.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Kid’s stuff.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: Abdominoplasty, Commander? It’s on the
house.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Abdomino – what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: A tummy tuck.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: You realize, Commander – this has to
go.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: Here we go, Commander. Through the Looking
Glass …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It’s me, Tito. It’s Jon.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hoag</strong>: Yes – the voice.</p>
<p><strong>castor’s voice archer</strong>: I’m a Catholic, goddamn I’m a
Catholic, goddamn it! Why would I shoot it! Why would I shoot the Pope?
the Pope?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Call Lazarro. Castor just came out of his
coma.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: This is it, Jon. For the next 72 hours –
you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Just make sure you’re there. On time.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Watch this hard-case – he’ll bite your nuts
off if he gets the chance!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do I get a meal on this flight?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: What a week for Commander Archer to go on
vacation. Maybe we should let him know.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Forget it. He left strict orders not to be
tracked down.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: He’ll shit when he finds out Castor pulled
through.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: If he shits at all.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Probably doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Put on the boots</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: They’re too tight.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: So’s a noose. Now keep your mouth SHUT.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: I’ve got fifty bucks says you’re dead by
dinner. Don’t disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>little man</strong>: Hey, Castor – remember me?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Waxy Wright. Didn’t Jon Archer bust you for
poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?</p>
<p><strong>waxy</strong>: They never should’ve voted against U.S.
statehood – the scumbags. We heard you got wasted.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do I look wasted – asshole?</p>
<p><strong>waxy</strong>: You look great, Castor. Really. Here – I got a
shot of your favorite – Mescal. Even has the worm.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Hit the spot.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: I’ve got bio-rhythm jumps – two – at the
eatery.</p>
<p><strong>security chief</strong>: Lock ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What? He started it!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You’ll what?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m going to have you fired.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: That’s two strikes, Dobbs. One more – you
know where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Hey, bro …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You’re not my brother. The brother I knew
would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer. At least tell me
the bomb is still going off.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: They haven’t found it yet – Listen, Pollux
…</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Lars … it’s me … well, believe it! Somewhere
in fucking Berkeley … The “Hoag Institute.” Just get the fuck over here.
And bring me a double cappuccino, ’cause Jesus, do I have the mother of
all hangovers … What? … Yeah, low-fat.</p>
<p><strong>hoag</strong>: Who are you? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I want my face.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Pollux …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: So? The procnias averano is a South American
bird. The flight here was only three hours! And yesterday a European
swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like
a wuss, and – I don’t know – you’re different.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like
shit.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Let me have a look.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Do you know what it is to be in a coma? It
fucks up everything – including your memory! I can’t even tell you why
Dobbs jumped me yesterday!</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You porked his wife the day he was arrested.
How could you forget that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I don’t know. Everything’s jumbled – so
you’re going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: A few blanks? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Like …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Come on … that was the wort day of our
lives!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Oh, God – Mom OD’d at County General.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Retching and convulsing while those bastards
didn’t even try to save her sorry ass. You gave her mouth to mouth – man
– even then you had some constitution.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Uh – to kill the doctors?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: After that. You promised you’d always take
care of me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And I bet I’ve kept that promise …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Only one you’ve never broken.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Fuck the past. We’ve got the future to look
forward to.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: No shit. Man, that was going to be one big
pay day.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s not the worst part.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: What’s worse than losing five million
bucks?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.
Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the
Smithsonian.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Yeah – well … the new Transamerica Tower
will have to do …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Thanks, Pollux.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: For being one helluva guy.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: “Thanks?” I guess they really did fuck you
up.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Somebody wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>impostor</strong>: What’s the matter? Don’t you like the new
me?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Castor?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It can’t be. It’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used was
“titanically remote.” Who knows? Maybe the trauma of having my face cut
off pulled me out. Or maybe God really is on my side after all. By the
way, I know you don’t get the papers in here.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You killed them?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK. And
torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are. Swallow
this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your
life.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What are you going to do, Castor?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Let’s not confuse things anymore. I’m
Archer. You’re Castor. But if you need proof –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What are you going to do!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’ve given me the freedom I haven’t had in
years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought
possible. But hell – this is America. One day a pauper, the next day, a
prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got an
important government job to abuse, – and a beautiful wife to fuck.
Excuse me – I mean “make love to.”</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s not me! That’s not me!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Sorry, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s quite all right. You never know what to
expect from a psychopathic criminal.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You better be nice, Castor. You could get
mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Pollux is – what?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Archer cut him a deal for turning state’s
evidence. He’s free.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Walton, you have to let me see the warden
–</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Or what? You’ll have me fired?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Jon? What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re a secret agent – you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: Christ, you’re in a mood. Okay – you had to
pull out. Pollux wasn’t fooled for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Dead right. Now – how about a beer for
me?</p>
<p><strong>tito</strong>: You … sure. Hang on – if Hoag’s dead, how’d
you switch back? And … … who pulled you out?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jesus, what a life.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Hi, uh – Eve. Can you believe I drove right
by the house?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What happened to your big “assignment”?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: As much as ever. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It didn’t work out as planned. Where are you
off to?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The hospital.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: The hospital? Oh, that’s right – you’re a
doctor. Ha-ha.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – I don’t have time to play games. There’re
leftovers in the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Have fun at work.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What is with you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t I usually kiss my wife?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What a dump.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: He hasn’t done her in two months? What a
loser … There’s gotta be one cigarette in this hole.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: – You’re lying, Karl, I E-mailed you three
times – Hang on a sec …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Screw your boundaries, Janie. You have
something I want.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Janie?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I don’t think you heard me … Jamie … You
have something I want …</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Clarissa left those here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I won’t tell mom if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: When did you start smoking?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’ll be seeing a lot of changes around
here. Daddy’s a new man.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You merciless bastard!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Business first. I went into the “Warrants”
system and erased your records. You’re clean. In fact, you’re now on the
informant payroll.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: I can’t even look at you without wanting to
vomit.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You better get used to it. That bitch
Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is
going to replace her?</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You can’t be serious –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – I’ll be one of the most powerful men in
the country. Didn’t matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs – I was
still too low on the food chain – always with somebody like Jon Archer
after me. The best part is – I’m the GOOD guy.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: No – the best part is, since it’s a
government job – they can’t fire you! But how can you be sure you’ll get
the appointment?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Trust me. You’re gonna love it …</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: A special privilege today – TV – courtesy of
Castor Troy.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: A biological bomb was discovered this
morning in the climate control system of the Transamerica-Two Tower in
San Francisco. A group of Japan’s leading geneticists were the target
…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: NSA Special Agent Jon Archer – who found
the device – risked his life to diffuse it only moments before it was
set to explode. We go live to the scene where the media-shy Archer is
holding his first press conference –</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Commander Archer – who do you think
planted it?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: That’s classified. But if he’s listening I
have a message for him: Nice try. Now you know who’s really in
charge.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: How’s the wife – Ed?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Fine, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Don’t you guys watch TV? Where’s the
parade?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Stop the presses – Jon Archer found a
personality …</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Oh – Commander. I didn’t see you …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Well, I saw you – Kim.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: Kim?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: That’s your name, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You always call me Miss Brewster.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Let’s try to be a little less formal from
now on, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: You’ve got someone in your office.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>kimberly</strong>: The Admiral?</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Look at you, Jon – at your age – an
American hero! I’d buy you a drink but I know you’d just turn me
down.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Normally, I would. But today …</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Practicing our executive signature, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re the only person in this place who can
see right through me.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: You’ve made us look pretty good in the past
week. And the way you handled the press –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just following your example.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: D.C.’s very high on giving you the
promotion. There’s just one problem.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Me. I have doubts about your ability to
stick with what is essentially a desk job.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I had doubts too. I always looked at a desk
as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened …</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: You’d have to start immediately.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Done. In fact, I was already plotting about
the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Jon, you’re starting to remind me – of me.
Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jon – you’d be so proud …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie. And for
Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Like you know anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Chinatown.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: On a school night?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Dad said it was OK. Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Hurry up – the salad’s getting warm and the
pasta’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – I’ve got to study.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I can’t believe you forgot. Eve – it’s Date
Night.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why do I feel like I’m on a blind date?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: They say love is blind. Do you think that’s
true?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I think – you’re trying to get me drunk.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Wouldn’t be the first time – or would
it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You wouldn’t even sip champagne at our wedding.
We were underage – you wouldn’t break the law. Remember what my brother
called you?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Who could forget? I was so young and clumsy
then –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So – how long will you be gone this time?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Gone?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Isn’t that what all this is about? Letting
Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, – your next assignment?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You always say that – then you leave.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Can’t you see I’m trying to change? I sent
Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you. I wanted to see the
candle-light dance in your beautiful –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – what?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job –
just like you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: … That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: So you see, I’m not going anywhere. Unless
it’s upstairs with you …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’re wearing your suit –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Call me spontaneous.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t they ever let us take these boots
off?</p>
<p><strong>waxy</strong>: Not unless you’re sent to the “Clinic.”</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You mean if I get sick?</p>
<p><strong>waxy</strong>: They don’t give two fucks about your health.
The Clinic’s where they send the real hard-cases for attitude
adjustment. Look at O’Neill –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>waxy</strong>: He hit a guard.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Looking for trouble, Castor?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Actually … yes.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Get a mop, he puked all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Bite hard, scumbag, ’cause you’ll be gumming
baby food from here on out.</p>
<p><strong>med-tech</strong>: Get his boots, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>emergency exit only</strong>: SAFETY LINES REQUIRED</p>
<p><strong>security box</strong>: Print unreadable.</p>
<p><strong>security box</strong>: Confirmed: Archer, Commander Jonathan
T. Please enter classified security code.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Come on, Vixen … Donner … Blixen …</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Damn, he’s good.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: South, North, East, West. You’ve got no
where to go.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What - am - I - doing?</p>
<p><strong>bomb hero lands new post</strong>: Promoted to NSA’s West
Coast Chief</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Use it or lose it, Jon.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon, it’s the tenth. I know how difficult it is
for you, but we still have to go.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’m late. Gotta protect and serve the world,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The world can wait, Jon. You’re going.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay, if you insist. But – you drive.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I think Jamie’s been seeing Karl again.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Great? He’s 17 – you told her to stay away from
him.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Oh, that Karl.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, Jon. That Karl.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ll have a talk with her. By the way, you
never said anything about last night …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon – this is hardly the time or place.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Happy birthday, Matty. Every day we think of
you. You’re part of everything we are and everything we do … I wish you
could know the lifetime of joy and happiness you brought us.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Stop crying … stop crying … stop …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: How’s our star witness?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Spilling his guts. Obviously his guilty
conscience has finally caught up with him.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Don’t get mad, but I just went for a little
stroll through the company switches.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’re supposed to be snitching, making me
look legit.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Don’t worry, nobody knows I’m inside. Check
it out. Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand? He’s
being treated for bone cancer at the V.A. Thanks to the miracle of NSA
grid-technology … – Ooops! His radiation does just quadrupled.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody
with such a big brain, you think awfully small.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: I’m just having some fun.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: There’s fun, bro. Then there’s FUN.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Eight pocket stingers … seven piper uzis …
six cobra carbines … five - net - launch-ers …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Yeah – it’s Santa’s Magic fucking Village.
Your present’s in here.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: As the new chief of covert operations, I’ve
planned a little get-together with the Pacific Rim station chiefs.
Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: And when they “get-together” – what
happens?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: We gut the organization – and rebuild it
with more reliable friends.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Most of the current chiefs – they must have
pretty hefty prices on their heads.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: All of them do. We’ll kill twelve birds with
one bomb. And we’ll be rich.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Good, because I checked your salary – and it
bites. How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today’s economy
is something I’ll never …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You’ll need to recultivate that virus.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper
off!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Castor’s escaped!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Escaped? From Erewhon? I want everyone on
this – our entire force and the SFPD.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: SFPD? Castor isn’t stupid enough to come back
to the city.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Trust me, he’s already here. Get going!</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: A lot of people think you’re a snitch. It’s
dangerous …</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Like I fucking care? I’m not just sitting
here!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Take my Glock. It’s a jungle out there.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Collect call to Evelyn Archer at
392-0888.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Who’s placing the call, please?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – Her husband.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Is someone there?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve, listen carefully. The man you think is
your husband – isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: – Got him.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Never mind that! Just take Jamie and get out
of that house. Don’t tell anyone where you’re going – especially not him
– just GO.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay, you’re having an emotional crisis. You
need to seek the help of a trained –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Think about it, Eve! Everything he’s done
recently has been peculiar, right? He’s said and done things your
husband would never do …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Whoever you are, don’t call again.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Don’t hang up …</p>
<p><strong>proctor</strong>: Doctor, we’re waiting …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No, Jon … think like Castor. Where would he
go … who would he turn to?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Uh-oh, somebody’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Yeah – me.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Jesus Christ, Castor.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: The last time I took orders from you I ended
up with five years probation.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Just get out of here – please. I – I’ll
…</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Damn it, Caz.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – you don’t have to rat out anybody …
nothing changes except now you’ve got the blessing – and protection – of
the NSA …</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: No … no, please. My father – he’s got a gun –
he’ll – he’ll –</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: That wimp won’t do shit. Anyway, you said he’s
never home –</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Who are you to call Jon Archer a wimp?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What are you – stupid?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You haven’t changed at all! Some guy tries to
rape me – and you side with him!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Did it look like I was siding with him? Did
it? You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared. Do you
have protection?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You mean like … condoms?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I mean like protection.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: – Now, uh, brush your bed and go to teeth –
it’s a school night.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: – Some condo complex on Telegraph Hill. I
played a hunch he might contact an old friend of yours …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: My place.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You shouldn’t have brought me here … it’s
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Better than you bleeding all over my car
upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won’t be here long.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I hear you’re a manicurist now – got your
own business and everything. I’m glad you’ve stayed clean.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive
Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing. At least he took an
interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I’m not the same person you remember.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Take the rest of those filthy things off.
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: More than you’ll ever know.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Talk? The only talk I ever heard from you was
“take it off,” “sit on it,” “I’ll see you around.”</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Perfect fit.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Should be. It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Nice-looking kid.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Of course he is … – He’s yours too.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: We’ve got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull
out.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What makes you so sure this guy’s gonna set up
his own brother?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ve never been more certain of anything.
Get everyone in position. – And get the word out – shoot to kill.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You heard the Commander – let’s saddle up!</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Go on, Adam … I’m not asking you for anything
– I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I’d see
you again, either.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Five. No one knows you’re his father. I
thought someone might want to hurt him – just to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Yes … someone might want to tear him apart –
snuff him out – for revenge.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: You’re not holding him right … Caz …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: In one awful moment – he could be dead.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Yes, he is. Caz –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Get down! GET DOWN!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Split up. I want to know the second he’s
spotted.</p>
<p><strong>sasha</strong>: Thank you, Caz …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Stay away from my family!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Too late, your kid worships me. And your
wife – she’s an animal. Even I can’t keep up with her.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: Peek-a-boo, dumb fuck.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Wait for a better shot.</p>
<p><strong>pollux</strong>: You tricked me into telling you shit I never
told anyone. Now take it to your grave.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Pollux … Pollux!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Get a medic – now! Hang on, Pollux …</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Forget him, sir. It’s only Pollux Troy …</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What the fuck do you think happened? Castor
Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? GO!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: And this thing can grow it?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Yes. Pollux bought one along with the
original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why would he need more?</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: He’s your brother, you figure it out.
Maybe he made another bomb.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Or reactivated the first one.</p>
<p><strong>dietrich</strong>: Right … like Jon Archer would ever let
that happen.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: I just heard about Castor’s fratricide –
rather poetic, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What is it, Admiral? I’m under the gun
here.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: I just thought that – under the
circumstances – you might want to postpone the meeting with the station
chiefs.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: No. Most of them are in transit by now. I’m
heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.</p>
<p><strong>lazarro</strong>: Okay, then. I leave it in your able
hands.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: My able hands.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: For you, bro.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Crap, I wanted hot wax.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: All units. I have a confirmed code
zero-zero priority alert. Proceed at once to Army Street Terminal.
That’s Army at Third.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Commander, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where should I be? Where’s everyone
else?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Backing you up! Didn’t you track Castor to
the Army Street Terminal?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: It was confirmed by your personal security
code. Nobody knows that code but you!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Obviously someone else knows it! Get
everybody back to their posts – NOW!</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know you – you’re the one who called. You’re
Castor Troy. You killed my son –</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: – I called, but I’m not Castor. I’m your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How did he expect to do that?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: An NSA surgeon gave me Castor’s face. He
handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow
Castor came out of his coma – and killed everyone who knew about the
mission. But not before he was transformed into me.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: If you need hard evidence, get it. Your
husband’s blood type is O negative. Castor’s is AB.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Remember the parachute dream? I’m falling,
Eve, and I need your help …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Hey – keep off the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – Studying.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Baby, I’m working on some very sensitive
documents here. If you don’t mind – use the laptop.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I disagree. You think I’ve been acting
strange. Like a completely different person.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – Yes.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Okay, I have a confession to make. But you
aren’t going to like it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – Of course I do.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Please be O-neg. Please …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I took it from my fake husband.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Why point it at me? I’m the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know that. Maybe Jon’s already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What more proof do you need?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Tell me what happened on April 9th – 13 years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: It was my first real date … I borrowed my
dad’s car and took her out for ribs – not knowing she was a vegan. To
make it worse, she broke her tooth on a pebble that somehow got into her
salad – and we drove around all night, looking for a dentist. I thought
the date was a total botch – but she kissed me. Even though it must have
hurt – she leaned over, ice-pack on her cheek, and kissed me goodnight.
She still has that pebble in the top drawer of her jewelry box. And I
think it still hurts her sometimes – to kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself?
How could you do this to us? Do you know – do you know what he did to me
…?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Whatever happened, whatever he did – I know
it’s my fault and I know I can never make it up to you –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: But you’re damn well going to try.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He freaked out when he thought I had seen this
stuff. I think it’s a list of cities – Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi
…</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must
be bounties. Castor’s not wasting any time.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s going to kill off our bureau chiefs –
one-by-one.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: – Or maybe all at once. There’s a get-together
tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.
He’s insisted Jamie and I be there too.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You can’t go. You can’t be anywhere near
that place.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: The bomb. He’s reactivated it. And everyone
there is going to die.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Can’t we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I know Lazarro – the first person she’d call
is “me.” We can’t take the chance of tipping Castor off.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jon, if I’m not there, he will be tipped off.
I’ll get rid of Jamie – but you and I are in this together.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Eve …</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Now – what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: She went to the hospital last night – she was
on call. Didn’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Find her – and watch her like a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Where’s Jamie?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know. She stole fifty
dollars from my purse and took off.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: I’ll deal with her later.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good. Because I’m fed up.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m going to the powder room.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Sure, baby – go anywhere you want. But I
have to give you an escort. Security reasons.</p>
<p><strong>lars</strong>: What’s taking so long?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Got a quarter?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, friends, I know this is
primarily a business gathering … but I’d like to take this opportunity
to tell my husband how proud I am of him … and how much I love him.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were
you ever mad for Madonna.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Back then – who wasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wait a second – you hated Madonna. Didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Well well. Here’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: There’s my little darling. The night
wouldn’t be complete without you.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Yeah, mom cut me some slack – but I decided …
I’d like to be here for you. Here, mom. You can have it back. Thanks,
though.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Jamie, have you met Ensign Mancini?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Too bad. Part of me was hoping you didn’t
know. Guess which part.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Did you really think it would be that easy,
you dumb fucks? I knew you’d make your move – all I had to do was wait.
Here’s tomorrow’s front page: In a suicide attack, Castor Troy – that’s
you, Jon – eluded hotel security and detonated a biological bomb,
killing dozens of NSA agents and their families – including my beloved
wife and daughter. – And the last three people who could expose me are
dead.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: This is between you and me. Leave my family
out of this.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It was between you and me – but you couldn’t
let it go. Even your son – that wasn’t supposed to happen. Not that I
was sorry to see the little bastard go …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Go – get help!</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We heard gunshots – where’s the
Commander?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wanda, I’ve got to tell you something.
Something crazy …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Kill me – and you kill yourself.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: What – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Vacuum-sealed globe … shouldn’t take
long.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Do it and your daughter lives.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: I don’t know. How long before it kills
us?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Give up, Castor. People are going to find
out.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Not if I kill you first …</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: No, Jamie. Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: It’s a trick, Jamie. I’m your father.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Jamie …</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a
trial. So take a hike.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What’s the matter with your voice,
Commander?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.
Where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You’re both in custody until there’s a DNA
fingerprinting and we can prove who’s who. Now put the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You can’t blame me for trying.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Will someone PLEASE tell me what’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Castor Troy’s in there! Move it or I’ll have
your badges!</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>castor</strong>: You won’t shoot me, Jon – I’m unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re right. I won’t shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You okay, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: He called you “commander,” Commander.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No life signs at all. He’s a turnip.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: That’s what they always say.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We’ll take him from here.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: But he’s my husband.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: But he works for us.</p>
<p><strong>archer’s voice</strong>: Hello, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I started wondering – if you couldn’t switch
back – would it make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: Would it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Damn right.</p>
