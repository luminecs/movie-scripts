<h1 id="the-ghost-and-the-darkness">the-ghost-and-the-darkness</h1>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: John Henry Patterson, come in. I’m Robert
Beaumont. Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you- -now why don’t
you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome,
with a wonderful smile. I’m sure you agree. Winning personality, heaps
of charm?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: My wife is the game player in the family,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Games? Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such
as yourself. One mistake and I promise you this: I’ll make you hate
me.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: We are building this railroad across
Africa for the glorious purpose of saving Africa from the Africans. And,
of course, to end slavery. The Germans and French are our competition.
We are ahead, and we will stay ahead providing you do what I hired you
to do-</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: -build the bridge over the Tsavo river.
And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’m sure you’ve examined my record. So
you know I’ve never yet been late on a bridge.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: You’ve never built in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: But I have in India- every country
presents problems.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: You’ll need your confidence, I promise
you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’ve got a reason far beyond confidence:
my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I’d be
with her when the baby comes.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Very moving, Patterson; I’m touched you
confided in me. But I don’t really give a shit about your upcoming
litter. I’ve made you with this assignment- -don’t make me break
you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You won’t have the chance. Any further
words of encouragement? Then I’ve a train to catch.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I tried to be late, John- it would have been
easier if you’d gone.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: We’re not much good at goodbyes,
Helena.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand
how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It was embarrassing- the man showered me
with compliments.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Oh dear- -you’re geting that downtrodden
look again-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -well, it’s just… …other men don’t
abandon their wives at such a time-</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: -oh please- if I’d been against your taking
this, you would have abandoned me. You’ve been desperate to see Africa
your whole life.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: What if there are complications?-</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: -not “what if”- there will be, there always
are. Which only means that our “son” and I- note my confidence- will
have an excuse to come visit.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Go, now. Such a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate
the leaving.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: You build bridges, John- -you’ve got to go
where the rivers are.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Many thanks. You’re Patterson, yes? Nigel
Starling- I’ll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have
told you that.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: He just gave me his “monster” speech.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but
when you truly get to know the man, well, he’s much worse. And I’m one
of his defenders. Forget him for now- it’s your first ride to Tsavo- I
think you’ll find it breathtaking.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: “Breathtaking” doesn’t begin to do it
justice. laugh, his mouth opens and sand flies in, and his coughing fit
returns</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Aren’t they amazing?</p>
<p><strong>what he’s pointing at</strong>: Some giraffes running along,
their absurd shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in
incredibly long strides.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You know the most amazing thing about
them?- they only sleep five minutes a day.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Don’t much like them.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: The females are bigger- only animal here
like that- have to be or they wouldn’t survive because the males eat the
young.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Anything special about them?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Just that they fart through their mouths.
Must make kissing something of a gamble.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’ve lived in Africa a year and I don’t
know what you know. How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Almost three hours. But I’ve been getting
ready all my life.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Every time I see something like that, I
know we’re right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives,
enrich their souls.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Beaumont says it’s to end slavery.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to
make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that
comes- -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can
become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Have you got that in writing?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Does he speak English?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And very poor French.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Samuel- John Patterson.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: The bridgebuilder- -we have been getting
ready for you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Excellent. Could I see the bridge
site?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’ve got medical supplies to deliver. Come
along to the hospital when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I will bring him, Nigel.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Why do the workers look unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Because they are here. Because Tsavo is the
worst place in the world. Come, John- to the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: tent area where prayer is It’s all
wonderfully under control, Samuel- you’ve done a splendid job.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Thank you. The truth is this: you have to
work at it constantly.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: The workers don’t get on?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Get on? They detest each other. Obviously
the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other
Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Railhead is across there.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Three thousand men laying track- when the
bridge is done, it all joins up.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Did it look like this in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: This is more difficult-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -but how wonderful that it’s difficult,
it should be difficult- what better job in all the world than build a
bridge?- make things connect- bring worlds together- and get it
right!</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Finish your tour?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: And anxious to get started. What is this,
mostly malaria?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes- but their suffering is only
transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all
pain.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: I’m David Hawthorne, this is my hospital.
And my advice to you is, “don’t get sick in front of it.” That was meant
to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You never had it.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Nigel and I don’t like each other
much.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I am also liaison between these two.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Clearly you don’t agree about building
the railroad?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It’s
only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Then why do you stay?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Who else would hire me? Beat you to it,
didn’t I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming
gift.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: This is Karim, one of my orderlies-
attacked by a man-eater earlier today- first incident of that kind
here.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: A man-eater attacks and you’re such a
buffoon you almost forget to mention it?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Well, he got away, didn’t he? Riding a
donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the
brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: I know it’s your first day and of course
you must be tired from the journey- -but what are you going to do about
it?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Karim will have to show me where it
happened. And of course, I’ll need the donkey. With any luck, I’ll sort
it out tonight. an astonished Starling</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I couldn’t believe it when you said “sort
it out.” As if it were the most normal thing in the world. “Ho-hum, what
lovely tea, I think I’ll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much
else going on anyway.”</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Well, he put me in a spot, didn’t he? But
that’s all right- after all, I’m responsible for everything that happens
here. And it certainly won’t do much for morale if a man-eater’s on the
prowl.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You said “of course” you’d need the
donkey. Why “of course”?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: We know three things about man-eaters.
First, they always return to where they’ve attacked before. Second,
they’re always old- they can’t catch other animals so they turn to us.
And third, they’re always alone- they’ve been cast out by their pride
because they can’t keep up.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I don’t suppose I could watch.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Might be exciting for you.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’ve never been all that adventurous. I
wouldn’t be in the way?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’d love the company. And I’ve hunted all
my life.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, why not? You seem so calm and
experienced. Why not, indeed!</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I hate to be a bother, John, but the
cramp’s getting worse. The pain is actually quite unbearable now.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’m sure you mean that to be comforting,
but-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -you’ll have to deal with it, Nigel.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That is precisely my plan- but back in my
tent.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: They own the night- nobody moves when
there’s a man-eater out there.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: John? I know this isn’t the time to ask,
but-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Since you’d only been here three hours
when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it’s worse
than you think- I’ve never even seen one.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …one shot…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: So that’s what a lion looks like.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Patterson has made the nights safe
again.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: All right, I’d like to start the
embankments today- -sufficient supplies on hand?</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: More than.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: With much more on the way- -John- we could
have had this chat on flatter ground-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -true enough- but without the comedy
relief. natured, smiles, gets</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: How lucky we are.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Aren’t we full of ourselves today? I think
it’s because of the lion.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: You know, I too have killed a lion.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: How many shots did you need?</p>
<p><strong>singh</strong>: I used my hands.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: All right- thee second embankment will go
there.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You do plan to mark it a bit more
precisely than just- -“there.”</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh
will be in charge of building them- and you’ll also build the roadbeds
and the three foundation pillars- and you’ll be finished in eight
thrilling weeks.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: John, it will not be easy.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Nigel, you’ll just have to use your
hands- Singh’s gesture, both</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: What are they looking at?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You- they cannot believe you’re still
here.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You don’t know what Tsavo means, do you? It
means “slaughter”…</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: -then he feasted on him, starting with
his feet-</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: -please- you needn’t be so graphic-</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: You intend “sorting this out”
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’ll try- but this feels so different-
that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh’s size.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: But you said they were always old.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: That’s what the books say…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You were contracted to work-</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: -malaria epidemic; very sudden.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Let me see the sick.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Oh, you’re a doctor now, too?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: There is no reason for fear.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: On that I choose to remain dubious. Two
are dead now in two nights.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Second death? Where?-</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: -far end of camp- man wandering alone at
night. Hawthorne’s examining the body now. There’s even less of him than
of Singh.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: But it’s crazy- the lion shouldn’t be
that hungry this soon. Samuel?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: We should construct thorn fences around
every tent area. Fires burning at night.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew-
no one allowed out at night. Send half your men to the bridge, the rest
with these two. And I’m sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there
is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Of course you will, you are white, you can
do anything… other. They are not</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Not good enough- look, it’s got to be
tighter. Tighter.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What a good week.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You mean nobody died?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: We all worked together. Worthy deeds were
accomplished. I liked the labor. My mother insisted on piano lessons-
broke the dear woman’s heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she
still was always at me about being careful with my hands. I like the
blood, is that strange?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Oh yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Look out, Samuel, here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Even you two must admit that it is a
glorious thing, what Man can accomplish. When there is a common splendid
goal, there are no limits. Think what we will accomplish when we all
have God’s warmth in our hearts. closed; he begins to snore. Patterson
can’t help</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I am immune to your disdain. When I came
here, I had but one small goal: to convert the entire continent of
Africa. Now I’ve decided to move on to something really difficult: I
will not rest until both of you are safely in the fold.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I’ve had four wives, good luck.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: The struggle is the glory…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Thank you, Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Good news?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I expect so- it’s from my wife.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I do, actually; very much.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: You give me hope, John.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: That was an attempt at humor but I don’t
feel very funny these days. I miss you terribly and after our son- I
still have total confidence- well, after he’s born I think travel might
be broadening. As he kicks me at night I’m quite sure he’s telling me he
definitely wants to come to Africa. Thought you might need
reminding.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Jesus, two of them…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- who
stand by the train -there’s nothing wrong with your men so stop telling
me there is-</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: -you do not call me a liar- you know
nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many
to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You think you matter? train which is
close to -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: He sees this chaos, he’ll replace you
all.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: He’ll replace you, too- that’s all you
really care about.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You think so? Fine. It’s best you get
out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they’ll be safe
under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done,
they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here,
they were the only ones to flee-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Pleasant journey?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: How could it be? I hate Africa.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Lovely sound- they seem happy.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Don’t they, though?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: So work must be going well?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Truthfully? There has been the occasional
odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I’d never built in
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: But overall, you’re pleased?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I have never experienced anything like
it.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I almost feel like getting right back
on.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I suppose it would be a dereliction of
duty not to at least look around.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Morning, friend, glorious day.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: As are they all.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I do need to see Starling.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Starling?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Awhile back he ordered some bibles- -I’ve
brought them. Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Well, I need to speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Let me deliver the bibles.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Excellent show. Where is Starling?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Here he comes now.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: What in hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: The Ghost and The Darkness have come.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: In English.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It’s what the natives are calling the
lions- -two lions have been causing trouble-</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: -what’s the surprise in that, this is
Africa?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It hasn’t been that simple so far.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: What have they done besides kill Starling?
How many have they killed?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Well, of course, I can’t supply a totally
accurate answer because there are those that are actually authenticated
and there are those that we once thought were workers killing each other
or deserting from camp so any number I give is subject to error-</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Thirty, I should think.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Christ! What are you doing about it?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: This is supposed to be salvation? What
kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’m calling it my “contraption”- we’re
going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we’re going to
leave a small opening opposite that door.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: In that half will be bait- human bait-
I’ll start things off- -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip
wire will run across the floor.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the
wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars,
will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Are you running a high fever, man? How
could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you
even conceive of it?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I didn’t conceive of it for the lions- I
built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: And it worked?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: In point of fact, it didn’t. But I’m
convinced the theory is sound.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I made a mistake hiring you- you’re simply
not up to the job.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify
people, don’t you? Well, fine- -except there isn’t a higher rated
engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you,
how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and
bring him here?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Let me explain about time- you’ve been
here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the
French are gearing up. And I don’t care about you and I don’t care about
the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad
finishes on schedule, I’ll get my knighthood and I want it. Samuel
appears, goes to Professional hunters may be the answer.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: All they’ll bring is more chaos and we’ve
plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what
happens to your knighthood then?</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I’m going to try and locate Redbeard- I
assume you’ve heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Every man who’s ever fired a rifle has
heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Very well, the job’s still yours, I’ll go.
But if I have to return, you’re finished. And I will then do everything
I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair? Told you you’d hate
me.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I do hate him. I want you to distribute
one bag of flares to every tent area- -tell the men to light them if
there’s trouble- -make it two bags.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Very good indeed.</p>
<p><strong>middle coolie</strong>: We have hunted since childhood.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: All right- you’ll spend your nights
inside. You’ll have plenty of ammunition. You’re totally protected, you
have really nothing to fear.</p>
<p><strong>middle coolie</strong>: That is correct. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Not once?- you didn’t hit it once?-</p>
<p><strong>middle coolie</strong>: -I would never make excuses- but a
fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -well, of course he kept moving- but he
couldn’t have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely
you must have wounded the thing-</p>
<p><strong>middle coolie</strong>: I assure you we came close many
times-</p>
<p><strong>middle coolie</strong>: -the next time we will do better.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: The next time will be as this time- The
Devil has come to Tsavo-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -that’s ridiculous talk and you can’t
seriously believe it-</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: -now you’re telling me my beliefs?- I
don’t think so-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I wasn’t and you know it and don’t push
it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: -at last you’re right- we do- you are the
problem in Tsavo-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -careful, Abdullah-</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You do not tell me “careful”- you do not
tell me anything- you listen while I talk-</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: No hints, Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: You don’t know all that has happened here-
the Devil has come to Tsavo.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: You’re right. The Devil has come. Look at
me. I am the Devil.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: I am a man of peace.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Am I to take it you want to live?</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Excellent decision. Your name is Abdullah?
I’m sure we’ll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: I think it’s been a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: You got old. I’m sure you’re John
Patterson. Stay out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I didn’t have a chance to thank you.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Got me out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Nonsense- Samuel would have done
something.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Let me save time- you are the engineer;
you are in charge; you’re sorry I’m here. Right so far? Good- because I
am not an engineer, I don’t want to be in charge, and I’m sorrier than
you are that I’m here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the
lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I
can leave. See any problems?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Actually, no.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: All right- let’s go into battle. I’m
Redbeard.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Somehow I guessed.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Starting now, we attack them.</p>
<p><strong>abdullah</strong>: How; we don’t know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: We’ll have to make them come to us, won’t
we? And since there are two of them, we’re going to set two plans in
motion. First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: That’s a terrible idea-</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: -is it, I’m sorry, but then, of course,
you’re the doctor, you should know.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in
the world should we go through all that?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I
could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of
blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It’s even possible that I
tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they’re
already contemplating feasting here. But I don’t want to answer you
because when you question me you are really saying that I don’t have the
least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I
am a fool. Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: I have been desperate for Patterson to
let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Then we agree.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I have to ask- why do you need me?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I don’t really. But understand something-
even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out- -when I’m
gone, you’ll still have to build the bridge. And I don’t want the men to
have lost respect for you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: That’s very considerate.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I’m always considerate- my mother taught
me that.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Why do you laugh?- you don’t believe she
taught me?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I don’t believe you had a mother.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You like him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Oh yes. But it takes time.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You’ve known him long?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Since his beard was red.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: How many cattle?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Four should do it.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: They will want a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Have you got it?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: No, but you do- -see, you were needed
after all. And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Masai Chief replies. Why so many?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Because I have two plans to kill the
lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: The Ghost and the Darkness have come… and we
can do nothing… but if you anger them… they will stay in Tsavo… and life
will become more unberable, that I know…</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Two lions are all that have come… they’re
only lions, that I know. And I will kill them both tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: You’re certain about tomorrow? But you
don’t seem excited.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You don’t enjoy killing, do you?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Then why do it?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I have a gift.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Strange man. Has he always been this
way?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Much gentler now.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: John?- Change guns with me- mine’s much
more powerful. I’ll be finishing the hospital tomorrow so I won’t be
with you- but if you’ll use this… …then I will.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Thank you. Why does he need you by
him?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: He doesn’t. He needs nobody. But we have
hunted many times… …he knows I am afraid of lions…</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I spotted one of them- -in there.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: The best way to ensure the kill when
you’re using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the
trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led
trackers?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I can try.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Samuel says you killed a lion.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It was probably luck- I’d rather you did
the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: You’d never force the lion to me- and
nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. Around there’s a clearing-
you’ll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the
sounds- I’ll make the lion come directly to you. Patterson to take</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: -all of you- spread the width of the
clearing- no gaps- go-</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Shoot for chrissakes!-</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Did you ever see a lion that size?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Not even close. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: …misfire… it jammed…</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Has it ever done that before?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: …don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: It’s Hawthorne’s.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: You exchanged weapons? You went into
battle with an untried gun?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: They have an expression in prizefighting:
“everyone has a plan until they’re hit.” You’ve just been hit… …the
getting up is up to you…</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Gentlemen, there’s no sickness smell at
all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely,
don’t open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask
them now. You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. And stay
there.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: And where will you sleep beautifully?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Patterson and I will be in the old
hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by
the time we’re done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be
irresistible.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Think about something else.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Have you ever failed?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Only in life…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: It’s all right. Stay ready. They know it’s
there.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap.
Your idea? Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: But of course yours worked.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: In point of fact it didn’t- but I’m
convinced the idea is sound.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: It would have been a beautiful bridge,
John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I suppose…
…never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I’ve had the
time today, nothing else on, and this… it’s graceful and the placement
couldn’t be prettier… and…</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You just got hit. The getting up is up to
you- but they’re only lions- -and I’m going after them crack of
dawn…</p>
<p><strong>what they see</strong>: the world. They move on.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: In my town, when I was little, there was a
brute, a bully who terrorized the place. But he was not the problem. He
had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the
problem. One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came
when they were both free togther. The two became different from either
alone. Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal,
together they killed.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I got big.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: it’s dark and dangerous and there is a
long low tunnel you have to half-crawl through.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Dear God-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Their den? Have you ever seen anything
like this?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Nobody’s seen anything like this. Lions
don’t have caves like this- -they’re doing it for pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: One of my chief attributes is that I’m
always calm.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Where could it have gone? How could it
get across the water? They’re only lions, yes?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Don’t they have to be?…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Both of them over there.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Ever have to use a machan? I did once. In
India. We will tonight.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: They’re used to people in trees, not in a
clearing. It may be tight.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Not for me- I’m too bulky and it’s your
idea, you go up there. Take the others to the water tower for the
night.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’ll be bait alone?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Yes. And I’ll be in some distant tree
where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your
fear?</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I’ll have to.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: I can’t control mine- I’d be lost without
the shame factor driving me.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Was that supposed to make me feel
better?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: It’s certainly the best chance they’ve had
to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You think they’ll come then? Why?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Because I think they’re after you.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: How many do you think they’ve killed?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: The most of any lions… a hundred…?
Probably more. Johnny…?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Don’t fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>what patterson sees</strong>: just mist and vaguely,
bushes.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: The donkey. And CAMERA begins
to move closer as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: The donkey, very, very
close-</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON, but the angle
shifts-</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON shifting as the angle
continues to change.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON. Still circling,
still closer.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON, always the circling
around.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON. Closer…</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON. Closer.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON. Closer.</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON, starting to slip off
the platform and</p>
<p><strong>what the ghost sees</strong>: PATTERSON, beginning to topple
off and</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: I think another for posterity- this is an
important moment in my life.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Understand, I had help-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: -not a time for modesty, Bob-</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: -undeniably your triumph.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Oh surely there’s enough credit for us
all- let’s not forget, you did the actual shooting. Of course, I hired
you, I was the general who put the team together. And generals are the
ones who tend to be remembered.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Perhaps you might put your head in its
mouth, sir- could be a corker.</p>
<p><strong>beaumont</strong>: Clever idea, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I never thought I’d say this, but I’m
glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Understood- you realize now you could
never have done it without me.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Actually, I could have done it much more
easily without you, but for whatever reason, I’m glad you came.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Where do you go next?</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Some Russian princes want to hunt the
Himalayas. You?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Help finish the railroad.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I want to meet my son- he must be what,
two months old?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Three years I’ve worked for the railroad.
Now I don’t know why. It seemed a good idea once.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: I feel the same about the bridge. This
country certainly didn’t ask for it, doesn’t need it.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Too soon to tell.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: My life was shaped because someone
invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad.
But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for
humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Some mysteries should not have
solutions.</p>
<p><strong>redbeard</strong>: Hold your son high.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: He has children?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Once…</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: Could you tell him that his wife- -that his
family has come to see him.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: You’re positive lions hate baboons?
Pebbles? Let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Underneath. Somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Afraid of lions.</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: It’s all right, Samuel- we all get
hit-</p>
<p><strong>patterson</strong>: Samuel! the rifle and the</p>
