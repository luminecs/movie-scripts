<p><strong>voice</strong>: And he opened his mouth and taught them,
saying…</p>
<p><strong>long shot – helicopter – ohio river country</strong>: High
over the country, CENTERING the winding river.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Beware of false prophets….</p>
<p><strong>lower long shot – helicopter – river country</strong>: We
approach a riverside village.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … which come to you in sheep’s clothing …</p>
<p><strong>a closer, lower helicopter shot</strong>: We descend low over
a deserted house; CHILDREN in yard run and hide; we hear “IT” counting
“five, ten, fifteen, twenty…”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … but inwardly, they are ravening wolves.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – “it”</strong>: He finishes his count with a
loud “Hundred” and turns, then:</p>
<p><strong>“it”</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>“it”</strong>: Heyy! Heyy!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – a leg</strong>: A skeletal leg in a rotted fume
of stocking and a high-heeled shoe. We HOLD a moment, then PULL UP and
AWAY over the converging heads of several CHILDREN. A CHILD whimpers
softly.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter shot</strong>: The yard and the CHILDREN, same
angle and height as the last descending helicopter shot. We PULL BACK
and AWAY.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ye shall know them by their fruits.</p>
<p><strong>high long shot – helicopter</strong>: CENTERING the
river.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A good tree cannot bring forth evil
fruit….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
fruit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wherefore by their fruits, ye shall know
them.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: He is the driver of the car.
Pleasant river landscapes flow behind him. He is dressed in dark
clothes, a paper collar, a string tie. As he drives, he talks to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: What’s it to be, Lord, another widow? Has
it been six? Twelve? … I disremember.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You say the word, and I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher driving</strong>: He brakes his car in
a small riverside town; then proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You always send me money to go forth and
preach your Word. A widow with a little wad of bills hidden away in the
sugar-bowl.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher driving</strong>: He shifts into second
gear, climbing a steep little hill.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I am tired. Sometimes I wonder if you
really understand. Not that you mind the killin’s…</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Yore Book is full of killin’s.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: But there are things you do hate, Lord:
perfume-smellin’ things – lacy things – things with curly hair –</p>
<p><strong>int. a burlesque house – medium close shot – a
dancer</strong>: She is hard at work to music o.s.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – audience – centering on preacher, in aisle
seat</strong>: Among the members of the sad burlesque audience, he is in
strong contrast: a sour and aggressive expression. Music o.s. We MOVE IN
fast to a HEAD CLOSE-UP.</p>
<p><strong>insert – preacher’s left hand</strong>: Labeled H-A-T-E in
tattoo across four knuckles, it grips and flexes.</p>
<p><strong>insert – his right hand</strong>: Before we see the lettering
he slides it into his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>extreme close shot – preacher</strong>: His head slants; a
cold smile; one eyelid flutters.</p>
<p><strong>insert – right hand and pocket</strong>: We hear the snapping
open of a switchblade knife and the point of the knife cuts through his
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>less extreme close shot – preacher</strong>: He seems to
“listen” for something.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: No, There are too many of them; you can’t
kill the world.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – a state trooper</strong>: He bends down and
speaks quietly next PREACHER’s ear.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: You driving an Essex tourin’-car with a
Moundsville license?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Harry Powell, for the theft of that touring
car you will spend thirty days in the Moundsville Penitentiary.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Preacher Harry Powell.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: A car thief! Picked up where you were! A man
of God? Harry Powell.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – moundsville penitentiary – day</strong>: A grim,
stone-turretted facade; an American flag idles at top center.</p>
<p><strong>close downward two-shot – john and pearl harper</strong>:
They sit in the grass, a sentimental picture. JOHN is nine; PEARL is
five. They are working together on PEARL’s doll; PEARL is dressing her,
while JOHN gets on a difficult shoe.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Stand still, Miss Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There! What’s so hard about that?</p>
<p><strong>long shot – over the children – ben harper’s ford</strong>: A
Model-T Ford approaches at maximal speed on uneven dirt road.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where’s your Mom?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Out shopping – you’re bleeding, Dad –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen to me, John.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He screams. BEN slaps him with
the back of the money hand, leaving blood on JOHN’s cheek.</p>
<p><strong>close group shot – john, ben, pearl</strong>: PEARL, and the
house, are in the BACKGROUND. PEARL just clutches her doll. During BEN’s
next lines, JOHN touches his cheek and looks at the blood on his fingers
and at the bloody money – of which we FLASH-CUT an INSERT.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen! This money here! We got to hide it
before they get me! There’s close to ten thousand dollars. Under a rock
in the smokehouse? Ah, no. Under the bricks in the grape arbor? No,
they’d dig for it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why, sure! That’s the place!</p>
<p><strong>int. front police car – through windshield</strong>: …and
over two STATE TROOPERS. They move at high speed, with sirens.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>2nd trooper</strong>: He prob’ly still has that gun.</p>
<p><strong>close group shot – ben and the children</strong>: Police cars
approaching in BACKGROUND. PEARL hugs her doll. JOHN is dazed. BEN
stands, pistol in hand.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dad, you’re bleeding….</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen to me, son. You got to swear. Swear
means promise. First swear you’ll take care of little Pearl. Guard her
with your life, boy. Then swear you won’t never tell where that money’s
hid. Not even your Mom.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You understand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not even her?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You got common sense. She ain’t. When you grow
up that money will be yours. Now swear. “I will guard Pearl with my life
…”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I will guard Pearl with my life …</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: … “And I won’t never tell about the money.”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And I won’t never tell about the money.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You, Pearl. You swear too.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Who’s them Blue Men yonder?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Blue men.</p>
<p><strong>a trooper</strong>: Ben Harper!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m goin’ now children. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Drop that gun, Harper. We don’t want them
kids hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just mind what you swore, son. Mind, boy!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He runs forward and clasps his
stomach, with his mouth open.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – ben and troopers – john’s viewpoint</strong>:
One TROOPER smacks the back of BEN’s head with a pistol barrel.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – ben and troopers – as before</strong>: Another
TROOPER, with a pistol barrel, knocks the pistol from BEN’s lifted
hand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>ben and troopers</strong>: BEN sinks to his knees as both
men, and two others from the front, close in on him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>full shot – john’s viewpoint – the cars</strong>: They drive
away fast in road dust.</p>
<p><strong>three-shot – the children and willa harper</strong>: Carrying
a shopping bag, their mother, WILLA, runs up from BACKGROUND between the
CHILDREN, looking always to cars o.s.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa</strong>: She has a rich body.</p>
<p><strong>resume three-shot</strong>: PEARL comes to her and she picks
up PEARL and the doll; JOHN, laden with his oath, walks quickly into the
house. WILLA does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars
o.s.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Ben Harper, it is the sentence of this Court
that for the murder of Ed Smiley and Corey South, you be hanged by the
neck until you are dead, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – the moundsville penitentiary</strong>: Same view
as before but now it is NIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>int. ben’s cell – night – close down-shot – ben</strong>: He
lies on his back, chuckling and murmuring indistinctly in his sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I got you all buffaloed! You ain’t never gonna
git it outen me; not none o’ you!</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Where, Ben? Where? Where?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And a little child shall lead them.</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – new angle – ben, then preacher</strong>: BEN
lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER stretches
down into the SHOT, upside down, snake-like.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Come on, boy: tell me.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Ben, I’m a Man of God.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tryin’ to make me talk about it in my
sleep!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: No, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’d I say? What? What? What? What?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You was quotin’ Scripture. You said – you
said, “And a little child shall lead them.”</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hm!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You killed two men, Ben Harper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right, Preacher. I robbed that bank
because I got tired of seein’ children roamin’ the woodlands without
food, children roamin’ the highways in this year of Depression, children
sleepin’ in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised
myself I’d never see the day when my youngins’d want.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: With that ten thousand dollars I could
build a Tabernacle that’d make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like
a chicken-house!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Would you have free candy for the kids,
Preacher?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Think of it, Ben! With that cursed,
bloodied gold!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How come you got that stick-knife hid in your
bed-blankets, Preacher?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I come not with Peace, but with a
Sword.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You, Preacher?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: That Sword has served me through many an
evil time, Ben Harper.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What religion do you profess, Preacher?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The religion the Almighty and me worked
out betwixt us.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Salvation is a last-minute business,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Keep talkin’, Preacher.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You reckon the Lord wouldn’t change his
mind about you if…</p>
<p><strong>insert – preacher’s hands</strong>: They rest on sill of cell
window, the lettered fingers legible. The right hand is lettered
L-O-V-E. The hands open, disclosing his open knife. They close over
it.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher, at cell window</strong>: His eyes lift
from his hands, heavenward. Moonlight on his face. He prays,
quietly.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Lord, You sure knowed what You was doin’
when You brung me to this very cell at this very time. A man with ten
thousand dollars hid somewheres, and a widder in the makin’.</p>
<p><strong>ext. penitentiary courtyard – night</strong>: Same shot as
before, but now, prison lights are on: and a man, a prison GUARD, waits
close inside door. BART THE HANGMAN joins him with a silent salute. BART
wears a hard derby.</p>
<p><strong>ext. penitentiary – the door</strong>: They walk in silence
into MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, the GUARD talkative, BART reluctant to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Any trouble?</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He was a cool one, that Harper. Never
broke.</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: He carried on some; kicked.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bart’s house – medium shot – bart and the
guard</strong>: On porch, by door, is a doll’s perambulator. BART and
GUARD walk into the SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He never told about the money.</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What do you figure he done with it?</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: He took the secret with him when I dropped
him.</p>
<p><strong>int. bart’s hallway – close shot – bart</strong>: He hangs up
his coat and hat. Across this his wife speaks o.s.; a lighted door is
ajar at rear of hall. A clatter of dishes and pans o.s.</p>
<p><strong>int. bart’s bathroom – close two-shot – bart and
wife</strong>: He is washing his hands in thick lather. Passing, she
pecks his cheek and, as we PAN, looks into the next room. He looks past
her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed. BART
registers, turns again to the basin, and we PAN them back into the
original TWO-SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: Mother: sometimes I think it might be better
if I was to quit my job as guard.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: You’re always this way when there’s a hangin’.
You never have to be there.</p>
<p><strong>bart</strong>: Sometimes I wish I was back at the mine.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: And leave me a widow after another blast like
the one in ’24? Not on your life, old mister!</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – bart</strong>: He approaches his children,
across whose bed we SHOOT without yet seeing them. He comes into MEDIUM
CLOSE-UP. As he leans and we TILT DOWN, he extends his large hands.</p>
<p><strong>close downward two-shot – his children</strong>: Two
rose-and-gold little GIRLS lie in sleep; BART’s hands enter the SHOT and
gently rearrange the covers so that their mouths and throats are free.
We watch for a moment more, the two sleeping faces.</p>
<p><strong>children’s voices</strong>: Hing, hang, hung. See what the
Hangman done!</p>
<p><strong>ext. cresap’s landing – day</strong>: We are in Peacock
Alley. The tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a
picturesque, mid-19th century remnant of the old river civilization,
which general Progress has left behind. Chiefly we see, in this order: A
schoolhouse ; Miz Cunningham’s second- hand shop; a Grange House
sporting a poster for a Western movie; Spoon’s Ice Cream Parlor. At the
end of the street, down the river-bank, is a brick wharf and Uncle
Birdie’s wharf-boat. In b.g. and in passing, suggestions of sleepy
small-town life.</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – john harper</strong>: Chanting voices o.s.
complete “see what the Hangman done!”</p>
<p><strong>close pulling two-shot – pearl and john</strong>: They stroll
barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk. They look towards the voices,
PEARL friendly, JOHN hostile.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – the children, over john and pearl</strong>:
Several, within the door of the Schoolhouse, stick their heads around
the edge. They chant at the HARPER CHILDREN. Another next the door, is
drawing something on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Hung, hang, hing! See the Robber
swing!</p>
<p><strong>closer shot – the children</strong>: … chanting, drawing. The
ARTIST completes in chalk, a large simple sketch of a man hanging from
gallows. As the verse ends we CUT TO</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – the children, over john and pearl</strong>:
They look towards OUR CHILDREN; JOHN pays them no attention. The drawing
is revealed. JOHN takes PEARL’s hand. The other CHILDREN giggle.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Hing, hang, hung! Now my song is done!</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – john and pearl – through window</strong>: We
SHOOT them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM’s second-hand store. The
back of a watch is silhouetted large in FOREGROUND; JOHN’s eyes
instantly fix on it; in b.g. the SCHOOL-CHILDREN finish their song and
vanish, giggling, into the schoolhouse. We hear the ticking of the
watch.</p>
<p><strong>insert – the watch</strong>: A watch with a moving
sweep-hand, ticking.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Are you goin’ to buy it, John?</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – miz cunningham</strong>: Fantastically dirty
and fantastically dressed, she hustles to them and we PAN her into a
THREE-SHOT. She talks like a Tidewater Cockatoo.</p>
<p><strong>miz cunningham</strong>: So your Mommy’s keepin’ you out of
school! Poor little lambs!</p>
<p><strong>miz cunningham</strong>: And how is your poor, poor
mother?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s at Spoon’s Ice Cream Parlor.</p>
<p><strong>miz cunningham</strong>: The Lord tends you both these
days!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: His eyes are fixed on the watch
o.s.</p>
<p><strong>miz cunningham</strong>: When they caught him, there wasn’t
so much as a penny of it to be seen! Now what do you make of that! Eh,
boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pearl and me, we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Hing, hang, hung.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You better not sing that song.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ’Cause you’re too little.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Can we get some candy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Howdy, youngins.</p>
<p><strong>int. spoon’s parlor – group shot – walt, willa, icey
spoon</strong>: We PAN WALT across a little of his Parlor; he plants the
lollypops back in a jar on the counter and leaves the SHOT as we TIGHTEN
IN on WILLA and ICEY. WILLA slides used dishes into wash-water; ICEY
jaws down her back, from first moment of SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Willa Harper, there is certain plain facts of
life that adds up just like two and two makes four and one of them is
this: No woman is good enough to raise growin’ youngsters alone. The
Lord meant that job for two!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Icey, I don’t want a husband.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Fiddlesticks!</p>
<p><strong>full shot – ext. street – night</strong>: The weekly movie
audience is letting out, next door to Spoon’s. Some start cars or
wagons, others stroll to Spoon’s.</p>
<p><strong>int. spoon’s parlor – evening – two shot – icey and
willa</strong>: We start with a CLOSE SHOT as ICEY’s hands slap together
a gooey banana split; TILT UP to TWO-SHOT, favoring ICEY; finish on
WILLA, on “it’s a man you need,” etc.</p>
<p><strong>walt’s voice</strong>: One solid brown sody, one Lover’s
Delight.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: ‘Tain’t a matter of wantin’ or not wantin’!
You’re no spring chicken, you’re a grown woman with two little youngins.
It’s a man you need in the house, Willa Harper.</p>
<p><strong>long shot – night – a train</strong>: A short, lighted,
toy-like train departs the town along the river-bank, whistling. The
whistle TIES OVER the previous DISSOLVE. Starlit sky.</p>
<p><strong>framing shot – ext. harper house – night</strong>: A square,
HEAD-ON SHOT, river water below and vibrant starlight above; featuring a
gas-lamp by the road; a tree; and pretty tree-shadows which work across
a window.</p>
<p><strong>int. harper children’s bedroom – night – two shot – john,
pearl, shadows</strong>: PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her
shoulder. JOHN sits on the edge of the bed, in his underwear.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Tell me a story, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Once upon a time there was a rich king…</p>

<p><strong>ext. the river-bank - church in b.g. - full shot - the
singing picknickers</strong>: A pleasant, grassy river-bank. Few men in
proportion to women and children. We CENTER PREACHER. They are singing
“Brighten the Corner;” PREACHER sings conspicuously well. The women
watch him and admire him. He gives WILLA the eye as we PAN to CENTER
WILLA, who looks wooed and self-conscious. ICEY enters the SHOT and

at water’s edge. JOHN and PEARL approach. As ICEY starts yammering, the
men, WALT among them, shyly withdraw.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: That young lady’d better look sharp or some
smart sister between here and Captina’s a-gonna snap him up right from

<p><strong>icey</strong>: She’s not the only fish in the river!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Now, you two stay put!</p>

bodies.</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – willa and preacher</strong>: They sit by the
water; drooping willows; almost in travesty of a romantic scene. WILLA
dabbles one hand in the water.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he done
with that money he stole?</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – preacher</strong>: His head goes slantwise
and he smiles oddly.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: My dear child, don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He watches intently towards his
mother; PEARL holds his hand. ICEY’s voice o.s.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: She’s moonin’ about Ben Harper. That wasn’t
love, it was just flapdoodle. Have some fudge, lambs.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: When you’re married forty years, you know all
that don’t amount to a hill o’ beans! I been married to my Walt that

<p><strong>long shot – over group</strong>: WILLA is standing, beckoning
JOHN.</p>
<p><strong>medium two-shot – john and pearl</strong>: They start towards
their mother.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: A woman’s a fool to marry for that. It’s
something for a man. The good Lord never meant for a decent woman to
want that – not really want it! It’s all just a fake and a pipe
dream.</p>
<p><strong>close group shot – preacher, willa, children</strong>: … as
JOHN and PEARL come shyly up. WILLA is seated again. She is radiant.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Well, John, the night before your father
died, he told me what he did with that money.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He desperately conceals his
reaction; he thinks BEN has betrayed him.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: That money’s at the bottom of the river,
wrapped around a twelve-pound cobblestone.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john and pearl</strong>: He now conceals his new
reaction.</p>
<p><strong>resume group shot</strong>: WILLA touches PREACHER’s hand,
warmly.</p>

front of him; PEARL to stand beside PREACHER, with the DOLL.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher and children</strong>: From JOHN’s

BACKGROUND, WILLA. She is now running fast towards ICEY, who walks
towards her with arms outstretched. Behind them the group of WOMEN.
BIRDIE’s guitar music begins o.s.</p>
<p><strong>ext. birdie’s boat – evening – medium shot – birdie, john and
skiff</strong>: BIRDIE sits beside his open door, strumming a guitar and
singing. The scene is lamplighted from within. BEN’s skiff is inverted
on trestles in FOREGROUND. At start of scene, we see only JOHN’s feet;
he’s under the skiff examining it. After three lines of song, he comes
out from under, and lounges against the skiff, tracing a tarry seam with
his forefinger.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: ’Twas down at Cresap’s Landing, Along the
River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore.
Now he sets in his old wharf-boat…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When’ll Dad’s skiff be ready?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Can’t hear ye, boy. So the big boats heave a
sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When’ll the skiff be ready?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: And the times that are gone by. I’ll have
her ready inside of a week; and then we’ll go fishin’. How’s your
Maw?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: O, she’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: How’s your sister Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Leavin’, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle
Birdie.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Well, goodnight, boy. Come again – any
time.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: And mind now – I’ll have your Paw’s skiff in
ship-shape, ’side of a week.</p>
<p><strong>moving shot – john</strong>: As he runs past SPOON’s, looking
in, he is curious.</p>
<p><strong>moving shot – spoon’s, his viewpoint</strong>: ICEY embraces
WILLA or waltzes her around; WALT looks on, pleased.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – john</strong>: He hurries away from us towards
home.</p>
<p><strong>framing shot – the harper house</strong>: In the otherwise
dark house, one window is lighted. JOHN enters the SHOT, his back to us.
Seeing the lighted window, he hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is somebody there?</p>
<p><strong>full shot – john</strong>: A tall, narrow shooting-frame;
right and left thirds of screen are black. We SHOOT from inside the
screen door. JOHN crosses the porch and softly opens the door and enters
on tiptoe and pauses, close to us, in the dark hallway, listening
sharp.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is somebody here?</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – john and the preacher – narrow screen</strong>:
PREACHER looks at JOHN; JOHN sinks onto the edge of a chair. PREACHER
sits opposite. A bar of light from door falls on PREACHER’s face.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I had a little talk with your mother
tonight, John; and your mother decided it might be best for me to – let
you know the news.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Your mother told me tonight she wanted me
to be a daddy to you and your sister. We’re going to get married,
son.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Did you hear what I said, son?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Married! We have decided to go to
Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You ain’t my Dad! You won’t never be my
dad!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: – and when we come back, we’ll all be
friends – and share our fortunes together, John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You think you can make me tell! But I won’t! I
won’t! I won’t!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Tell me what, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Are we keeping secrets from each other,
little lad?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: No matter, boy, we’ve got a long time
together.</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – john and preacher</strong>: JOHN starts for

ford</strong>: It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with receding
engine sound o.s., disclosing:</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – john and pearl</strong>: ICEY’s skirts in
BACKGROUND. They are awfully spic-and-span; they even wear shoes.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Now can I tell?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: When Mr. Powell’s our Daddy, then can I tell
him about–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You swore, Pearl!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You promised Dad you wouldn’t never tell!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you tell! Don’t you NEVER DARE tell!</p>
<p><strong>shoulder close-up – willa</strong>: She is caressing her
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – willa</strong>: Her back is to us. She is in a
pathetic night dress; she stands before a mirror in a hotel bedroom in
Sistersville. She walks to the door.</p>
<p><strong>insert – willa’s hand</strong>: It hesitates on the
doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa</strong>: Shooting OVER her as she opens
the door, we see PREACHER in bed, his back to us. Beyond him, a window.
The drawn shade rustles quietly.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – the door</strong>: … from within the room. WILLA
closes the door on which PREACHER’s coat hangs. The closing brings a
knocking sound. WILLA feels the outside of the coat; feels something
hard; takes out the knife and looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa</strong>: A moment of perplexity; then a
little smile.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Oh! It’s… uh…</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – willa and preacher</strong>: We SHOOT OVER
PREACHER as she approaches modestly and stands by the bed.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Harry…</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Fix that window shade.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa at window</strong>: She adjusts the shade,
looking always towards the bed. She smiles maternally. As we PULL BACK
and PAN into FULL SHOT OF BED, she comes to the bed and sits on the edge
and slips off her mules. PREACHER’s back is to her.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Harry!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I was praying.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, Harry! I didn’t know! I
thought maybe–</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You thought, Willa, that the moment you
walked in that door, I’d start in to pawing you in the abominable way
men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain’t that right now?</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: No, Harry! I thought–</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I think it’s time we got one thing
perfectly clear, Willa. Marriage to me represents a blending of two
spirits in the sight of Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Get up Willa.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Harry, what–</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Now go and look at yourself yonder in that
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Look at yourself.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa, preacher, bulb</strong>: WILLA is in HEAD
CLOSE-UP; bulb hangs at center; PREACHER, in his nightshirt, is beyond
it.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: What do you see girl?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You see the body of a woman! The temple of
creation and motherhood. You see the flesh of Eve that man since Adam
has profaned. That body was meant for begetting children. It was not
meant for the lust of men.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Do you want more children, Willa?</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: I– no, I–</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: It’s the business of our marriage to mind
those two you have now – not to beget more.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You can get back into bed now and stop
shivering.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Help me to get clean so I can be what Harry
wants me to be.</p>
<p><strong>group shot – congregation</strong>: A dozen country men and
women in religious ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: AAA-MEN!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: You have all sinned!</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: But which one of you can say, as I can say: I
drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin’ him, for clothes
and per-fumes and face paint!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: But Brethren, that’s where the Lord stepped
in! That’s where the LORD stepped in!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: And the Lord told that man–</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: The Lord said, take that money and throw it
in the River!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Throw that money in the River! In THE
RIVER!</p>
<p><strong>extreme close down-shot – pearl’s doll</strong>: It lies face
down on arbor bricks, its back wide open; money spilling out. A little
breeze toys with the money. HOLD, a moment in silence. Then we hear a
snipping sound o.s. TILT UPWARD into –</p>
<p><strong>close shot – pearl</strong>: She sits at the end of the
grape-arbor. She finishes cutting a skirted paper-doll out of a hundred
dollar bill and lays it down beside a male hundred dollar paper-doll.
She pats the dolls.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Now! You’re John – and you’re Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Pearl? … Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You’ll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pearl! You ain’t–</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John, don’t be mad! Don’t be mad! I was just

<p><strong>john</strong>: Getting Pearl to bed. I–</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: What’s taking you so long about it?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: What’s that you’re playing with, boy?</p>

here and don’t clean up afterward.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Come on, children!</p>
<p><strong>full shot – children</strong>: They stand up, look towards
PREACHER, and slowly start towards him. The two forgotten paper-dolls
are blown towards him too.</p>
<p><strong>moving shot – preacher – john’s viewpoint</strong>:
PREACHER’s watch-chain gleams. The shot SLOWLY CLOSES DOWN on it and
becomes still. We see the paper-dolls blow past him.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Now, up to bed with the both of
you.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john and pearl</strong>: JOHN starts to laugh
uncontrollably. We PAN them past PREACHER’s stomach into FULL SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Come here, John. Run along,
Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Your mother says you tattled on me, boy.
She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: That wasn’t very nice of you, John. Have a
heart, boy.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: His helpless reaction. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Run along to bed.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa in profile</strong>: …and PULL AWAY
showing JOHN as he turns to her.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Were you impudent to Mr. Powell, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom, I didn’t mean–</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: What were you impudent about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He asked me about the money again, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: You always make up that lie, John. There is
no money, John. Can’t you get that through your head?</p>
<p><strong>close upward two-shot – john and birdie</strong>: They look
down into the water.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter in the

enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit – and a
horse-hair.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Won’t he bust it, Uncle Birdie?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Shoot, a horse-hair’ll hold a lumpin’
whale.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: You don’t mind my cussin’, boy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Tell you why I ask – your step-pa bein’ a
Preacher an’ all…</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Never was much of a one for preachers
myself. I dunno what’s wrong up at your place, but just remember one
thing, Cap – if ever you need help, you just holler out and come
a-runnin’. Old Uncle Birdie’s your friend.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: There! You slimy, snaggle-toothed,
egg-suckin’, bait-stealin’ so-and-so!</p>
<p><strong>full shot</strong>: He beats the fish with the heel of an old
shoe.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Mind what I told you. If ever you get in a
crack just come a-runnin’.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: Admiring BIRDIE, he squares his
shoulders, full of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can we eat him, Uncle Birdie?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: If you got n appetite for bones and
bitterness.</p>
<p><strong>int. children’s bedroom – night</strong>: The children are

<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The summer is young yet, little lad.
Pearl?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: John’s a feller who likes to keep
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Mm-hm.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I’ll tell you a secret.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I knowed your Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: And do you know what your Daddy said to
me? He said, “Tell my little girl Pearl there’s to be no secrets between
her and you.”</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: What secret shall I tell?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: That’s no secret. I’m five.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john – preacher and pearl in b.g.</strong>: A
look of impotent hatred.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Sure, that’s no secret.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You’re just foolin’! My name’s Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Tst-tst! Then I reckon I’ll have to try
again! Where’s the money hid?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You swore you wouldn’t tell! You swore! You
swore! You swore!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: He is sure know PEARL
knows.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: You hit Daddy with a hairbrush!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You see? We just can’t have anything to do
with John. You and me will go down to the parlor.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – preacher and pearl</strong>: Outside door as he
closes it.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: John’s just plumb bad through and

<p><strong>pearl</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Where’s the money hid?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Where’s the money hid? Tell me, you little
wretch, or I’ll tear your arm off!</p>
<p><strong>int. harper hallway – two-shot – willa and preacher</strong>:
Narrow screen, same set-up as in earlier corridor scene, PREACHER and
WILLA. Their eyes meet. Pause.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I didn’t expect you home so soon.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – willa</strong>: She still smiles; her eyes turn
to sound of PEARL’s sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>two shot – as before</strong>: PREACHER stands still; WILLA
in BACKGROUND opens closet door where PEARL sobs.</p>
<p><strong>two shot – walt and icey</strong>: …washing and drying
glasses. ICEY is washing briskly, WALT is drying slowly.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Icey, I’m worried about Willa.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m figurin’ how I can say it so’s you won’t
get mad.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Say what, Walt Spoon!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: There’s something wrong about it, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: About Mr. Powell. All of it!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Walt!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Now, Mother, a body can’t help their
feelin’s.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt
Spoon!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Mother, I only–</p>
<p><strong>int. willa’s and the preacher’s bedroom – full shot – willa
on bed –</strong>: PREACHER IN BACKGROUND WILLA lies in profile on the
bed along the bottom of the frame. A prim, old woman’s nightdress makes
her look like a child. Her hands are clasped. PREACHER, fully dressed,
stands at the window, which is in BACKGROUND towards foot of bed. His
coat, hung over a chair, is in silhouette. River mist outside window
halated by exterior gas-lamp. The window shade is up. She is mumbling in
prayer. She stops.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Are you through praying?</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: I’m through, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You were listening outside the parlor
window.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: It’s not in the river, is it, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Ben never told you he throwed it in the
river. Did he?</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Then the children know where it is hid? John
knows? Is that it? Then it’s still here, somewhere amongst us, taintin’
us?</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: So you must have known it all along,
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher, listening</strong>: After a moment,
the river boat whistle blows, nearer. HOLD CLOSE-UP for a moment after
whistle.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: But that ain’t why you married me, Harry. I
know that much. It couldn’t be that because the Lord just wouldn’t let
it.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: He made you marry me, so’s you could show me
the Way and the Life and the Salvation of my soul! Ain’t that so,
Harry?</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: He has heard the voice and
starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>resume two-shot</strong>: He has moved over to the coat on
back of chair.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – coat</strong>: His hand goes into the pocket and
brings the knife out.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: So you might say that it was the money that
brung us together.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: The rest of it don’t matter, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>insert – preacher’s hand and knife</strong>: It clicks
open.</p>
<p><strong>resume two-shot</strong>: As he raises his arm to strike:</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – willa</strong>: …with foolish, ecstatic
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>willa</strong>: Bless us all!</p>
<p><strong>int. children’s bedroom – full shot – the shadows on the
wall</strong>: They are shaped as in earlier scene, but altered by mist.
Set-up as in earlier scene. Over them we hear the whinny-and-catch and
the failure of the Ford being cranked; once; then again: then JOHN’s
shadow moves on the wall and on a third cranking which engages the
engine, we PAN TO WINDOW, shooting over JOHN, who peers out, into blind
mist. The gears of the car shift; the car moves away unseen; its sounds
diminish slowly, and die. A moment of silence; then JOHN turns and we
PAN him to the bed. He gets in beside PEARL, who is asleep, and, as we
TIGHTEN IN CLOSE, puts his hand across the face of the doll.</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – icey</strong>: An ominous expression. She
looks sharp to WALT, beckoning secretly, through rear screen door of
kitchen, onto porch.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Walt! Come quick!</p>
<p><strong>full figure shot – walt</strong>: He is scrubbing out an ice
cream container on the back porch. He looks up and moves towards
her.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s wrong, Mother?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Sshhh! He’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Mr. Powell! Willa has run away!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll be switched! …</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Just went?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: She took out some time during the night – in
that old Model-T –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is he hit pretty bad?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: All to pieces!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: There’s a little peach brandy – maybe a
sip?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: A man of the Cloth?</p>
<p><strong>medium close shot – walt</strong>: He pours, snaps it down;
weak-defiance.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Walt Spoon, that’s for sickness in the
house!</p>
<p><strong>medium close shot – walt</strong>: He looks towards o.s.
sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What can we do, Mother?</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: I thought if you went and talked to him –
another man –</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – preacher</strong>: He sits at a table, his back
towards us, mumbling over his Bible.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Mister Powell?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: A strange woman is a narrow pit!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Amen! Amen!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: She lieth and wait as for a prey. And
increaseth the transgressors among men.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do
without you!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Mister Powell!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is there anythin’ – anythin’ …?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: It is my shame – my crown of thorns. And I
must wear it bravely.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: What could have possessed that girl?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Satan.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Didn’t you have no inkling?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Yes; from the first night.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The first night?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Our honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: She turned me out of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Nnnoooo!!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – walt</strong>: Filling his pipe.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What do you figure to do?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Do? Why, stay and take care of them little
kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their
young lives.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Mmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – walt</strong>: Dabbing at moisture in the corner
of his eye.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s mighty brave of you, Reverend.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I reckon it’s been ordained this way,
Brother Spoon.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Didn’t– didn’t she leave no word?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the
bureau.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I burned it.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I tore it up and burned it – it stank so
strong of hellfire.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The pitcher has went to the well once too
often, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She’ll come draggin’ her tail back home.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: She’ll not be back. I reckon I’d be safe
in promising you that.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Maybe she’s just run off on a spree.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, there’s no harm in hopin’.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Ain’t no sense in it, neither. I figured
somethin’ like this was brewin’ when she went to bed last night.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: She tarried around the kitchen after I’d
gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong…</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: She’d found this fruit jar of dandelion
wine… … that the husband – Harper – had hid somewheres in the cellar.
She was drinking.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – icey</strong>: ICEY is happy to let her mouth
fall open and let out a gasp.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – walt</strong>: Sniffling.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I tried to save her.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you
tried!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The devil wins sometimes!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Can’t nobody say I didn’t do my best to
save her!</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – willa and car</strong>: She is in profile as
before–</p>
<p><strong>close shot – a baited hook</strong>: It descends and catches
on the windshield, and the line tautens; then tugs. We start to follow
the line up.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – above water – the line</strong>: We continue to
follow the line up, and bring in, close, the stern of BEN HARPER’s
skiff.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – uncle birdie</strong>: He sits back, tugging
unconcernedly at the line. Then he leans over to see what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – birdie</strong>: … as he peers over side.</p>
<p><strong>moving underwater shot – willa</strong>: We hear PREACHER’s
voice o.s., singing:</p>
<p><strong>ext. harper home – full shot – the house and tree</strong>:
PREACHER leans against the tree; he continues singing:</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Leaning! Leaning! Leaning on the
everlasting arms! Children!</p>
<p><strong>closer moving shot – preacher</strong>: We start moving
before he does. LOW CAMERA; full figure. We TILT to frame him from the
waist downward and follow close behind him. As he leaves the tree and
walks along the side of the house; we TILT DOWNWARD and CLOSE IN, to
follow only his feet; he steps past a tiny cellar window and we PAN and
TIGHTEN IN CLOSE ON IT, into–</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – john and pearl</strong>: Their noses are
flat against the glass; their cheeks touch; their window isn’t quite big
enough to hold both their heads. It is on the ground; we don’t see their
chins. They look towards the departed PREACHER.</p>
<p><strong>int. cellar – medium close two-shot – john and
pearl</strong>: They are standing on a coal heap, faces at the
window.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John, why do we have to hide?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Careful.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s gone to Moundsville.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: To see Dad?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, I reckon that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Children!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Someone is after us, Pearl.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I want to go upstairs. It’s cold and spidery
down here. I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now, listen to me, Pearl. You and me is
runnin’ off tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If we stay here, somethin’ awful will happen
to us.</p>

<p><strong>john</strong>: No, that’s just it. No.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – a room upstairs</strong>: PREACHER looks under a
bed.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Where are we goin’, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Somewheres. I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – john and pearl</strong>: … beside an apple
barrel. PREACHER’s footsteps cross kitchen, o.s.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I’m hungry, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll steal somethin’ to eat.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: It’ll spoil our supper.</p>
<p><strong>the cellar door – the children’s viewpoint</strong>: The door
opens; PREACHER’S head, carrying a candle in holder, a white-washed wall
and stairs are lighted.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: I hear you whisperin’, children,
so I know you’re down there. I can feel myself gettin’ awful mad,
children.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John…</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: My patience has run out, children.
I’m comin’ to find you now.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Yoo-Hooooo! Mis-ter Paow-welll!</p>
<p><strong>icey’s voice</strong>: Just a little hot supper I fixed for
you and the children.</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Bless you, bless you!</p>
<p><strong>icey’s voice</strong>: And how are the children?</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: They’re down there playin’ games
in the cellar and they won’t mind me when I call ’em. I’m at my wit’s
end, Miz Spoon.</p>
<p><strong>icey’s voice</strong>: John: Pearl:</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: John! Pearl! Shake a leg!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: I won’t have you worrying poor Mister Powell
another minute.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to
toe!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Want me to take ’em up and wash ’em good?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I’ll
tend to them. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>icey’s voice</strong>: Don’t be too hard on ’em, Reverend.
Poor motherless children.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Remember now, Mister Powell, don’t be afraid
to call on us. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He watches ICEY leave, o.s.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – preacher and icey</strong>: ICEY goes away along
path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, watches her a moment, then
turns.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Weren’t you afraid, my little lambs, down
there in all that dark?</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – john</strong>: Wondering what to do next.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – birdie, over bess’s picture</strong>: We begin
with HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL BACK. He is rocking;
and drunk. A bottle stands beside the picture. He turns and speaks to
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: They’ll think it was me! They’ll think it
was old Uncle Birdie.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – birdie – new angle</strong>: His hands grip the
edge of the chest on either side of the picture, which we now see.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: If you’d o’ seen it, Bess! I’m drunk as a
lord and I know it, but…</p>
<p><strong>birdie’s voice</strong>: Sweet Heaven, if you’d o’ seen
it!</p>
<p><strong>resume previous shot</strong>: BIRDIE picks up the bottle.
His hand and the liquor tremble.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Down there in the deep place… her hair
wavin’ lazy and soft like meadow grass under flood waters, and that slit
in her throat, just like she had an extry mouth.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: … Bess, for if I go to the Law, they’ll hang
it on to me.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – birdie – new angle</strong>: The reverse angle
of the opening shot. BIRDIE rocks heavily; liquor gurgles from bottle to
floor.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Sweet heavens, save poor old Uncle
Birdie.</p>
<p><strong>medium three-shot – preacher, john, pearl</strong>: PREACHER
sits at head of table. JOHN stands to PREACHER’s right, around corner of
table. He remains expressionless and immobile until he speaks. PEARL
stands to JOHN’s right, hugging the DOLL. The table is loaded with good
food. PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately with
his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his hands. He
waits.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Why, sure. And there’s fried chicken and
candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Can I have my supper, please?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Can I have milk too?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Yes. But, first of all, we’ll have a
little talk.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: About our secrets.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Why, pray tell?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Because John said I mustn’t.</p>
<p><strong>three shot reverse – preacher, over necks of
children</strong>: He slaps the table; his eyes crackle.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: NEVER–MIND–WHAT–JOHN–SAID!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: John is a meddler. Stop sniveling. Looky
here a minute!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Want to see something cute? Looky now!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: How about that! This is what I use on
meddlers.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: John might be a meddler.</p>
<p><strong>three shot – the children, over preacher</strong>: PEARL
thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: NO – no, my lamb. Don’t touch it! Now,
don’t touch my knife! That makes me mad. Very, very mad.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Just tell me now; where’s the money
hid?</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: But I swore. I promised John I wouldn’t
tell.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: JOHN–DOESN’T–MATTER! Can’t I get that
through your head, you poor silly, disgusting little wretch!</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – pearl</strong>: Her mouth quivers; a large
tear brims in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: There now! You made me lose my temper!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I’m sorry! I’m real sorry!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Now! Where’s it hid, honey?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll tell.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: I thought I told you to keep your mouth
shut–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: NO – it ain’t fair to make Pearl tell when she
swore she wouldn’t. I’ll tell.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Well, I declare! Sometimes I think poor
John will make it to Heaven yet!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: All right, boy: where’s the money?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In the cellar; buried under a stone in the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>three shot – preacher, over children</strong>: He closes and
pockets the knife. His eyes never leave JOHN’s.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: It’ll go hard, boy, if I find you’re
lyin’.</p>
<p><strong>three shot – children, over preacher</strong>: PEARL gapes up
at JOHN as he speaks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I ain’t lyin’. Go look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: … as he gets up, cellar door

<p><strong>preacher</strong>: All right…</p>

<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Go ahead of me – the both of you.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – the cellar steps – from the bottom</strong>: The
CHILDREN precede PREACHER, who carries a candle in holder. PEARL is
gaping at JOHN’s lie. JOHN is looking left and right, casing the
joint.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: You don’t reckon I’d leave you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Why sure, boy, sure.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Now, where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can’t
abide liars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yonder.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – new angle – over the three</strong>: JOHN points
out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars; it is at the most
distant part of the cellar from the stairs. PREACHER starts toward it,
leaving them at foot of stairs, then turns, catching JOHN’s ruse.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: O no you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>three shot – new angle</strong>: They arrive beneath the
shelf.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Now: where?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Under the stone in the floor.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher, featuring floor</strong>: His hands
sweep dust and expose concrete. He straightens on his knees and turns to
the CHILDREN in close BACKGROUND.</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – preacher</strong>: … as he turns.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: This is concrete.</p>
<p><strong>close two-shot – the children</strong>: A moment’s
silence.</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: John made a Sin. John told a lie.</p>
<p><strong>three-shot – favoring preacher</strong>: PREACHER gets slowly
to his feet and puts on his “listening” look. His sincerity is beyond
doubt.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The Lord’s a-talkin’ to me now. He’s
a-sayin’, “a liar is an abomination before mine eyes.”</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Speak, boy: where’s it hid?</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Speak, before I cut your throat and leave
you to drip like a hog hung up in butcherin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – pearl</strong>: She starts to sob.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!</p>

<p><strong>pearl</strong>: Inside my doll! Inside my doll!</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – john and preacher, favoring preacher</strong>:
PREACHER is astounded. His hands fall away from JOHN. He leans back
against the wall and talks through laughter.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: In the doll! Why, sure! Sure!</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – john</strong>: His eyes are all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>three-shot – preacher, john, pearl</strong>: PREACHER makes a
lunge across JOHN for the doll; JOHN, ducking under his arm, pulls PEARL
forward with his left hand; he turns backwards and with his free hand,
in one movement, knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on the
shelf.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: Jars shower over him; one
crowns him and breaks, shedding guck, which he wipes from his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>two shot – the children</strong>: They start up the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – preacher</strong>: He makes one step forward,
steps on a rolling jar and falls.</p>
<p><strong>two shot – the children</strong>: They are near the top of
the stairs. We hear PREACHER below them. JOHN slips and they nearly fall
backward. As JOHN recovers, PREACHER enters the shot, his back to us.
The children get through the open door as PREACHER reaches the top. JOHN
slams the door, catching PREACHER’s hand. PREACHER screams. JOHN’s
astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door; the door loosens;
PREACHER yanks his hand loose and sucks it, groaning; the door slams to;
the bolt is shot home.</p>
<p><strong>head close-up – preacher</strong>: … over sound of slamming
bolt. He snarls like the Big Bad Wolf.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen – close two-shot – john and pearl, by
door</strong>: PEARL, dangling her doll, cries. JOHN, panting, leans
against wall by door. JOHN is wondering what to do now. Pause.</p>

wanted that money is so’s you could have it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The river. That’s the only where! Uncle Birdie
Steptoe!</p>
<p><strong>preacher’s voice</strong>: Puhr-urrl? Want your Mommy

DEVIL’S OWN STRUMPET!</p>
<p><strong>framing shot – ext. harper house</strong>: A pretty, pastoral
shot of the house in light mist, as they run across and leave the shot.
Before they disappear, we hear PREACHER’s fists hammering against the
door. We stay on the house at leisure; we hear him lunging, shoulder to
door; we begin to hear squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood.</p>
<p><strong>full circle shot – framing birdie’s wharf-boat</strong>: An
ultra-romantic image of shelter and peace. Frogs or river noises o.s.,
then the rattle of running footsteps. The CHILDREN enter, their backs to
us, sprinting towards the boat. Light mist as in previous shot.</p>

<p><strong>birdie</strong>: I never done it, boy. Sweet Heaven, I never
done such a terrible thing! I’ll swear on the Book to it, boy! I never
done it! I never!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john</strong>: He is lost; and he becomes a
man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s still the river. The skiff is down by
the willows.</p>
<p><strong>long shot – the children</strong>: We shoot from the river.
They struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds at edge of river,
towards skiff, whose prow, tethered to willow, we see throughout this
unmoving shot, at our extreme right. When they come opposite skiff –
which is a few yards out from shore –</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – the children</strong>: PEARL, frankly bored,
dangling her doll, is yawning. JOHN, as he finishes undoing the rope
from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on pursuit. His eyes

He peers downward, his open knife catching the light.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Children?</p>
<p><strong>full shot – the children</strong>: Same camera position as
before. They are floundering through mud, half-way to the skiff.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – preacher</strong>: Same position and angle as in
previous shot of him. He is half-way down the bank. With his knife, he
hacks at an entangling vine.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – the children</strong>: Position and angle as
before. They reach the skiff. Hacking sounds, o.s.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness,
hurry!</p>
<p><strong>pearl</strong>: That’s Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – pearl and doll</strong>: … as they land,

it!</p>
<p><strong>full shot – preacher</strong>: … as he gets up at edge of
mud.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Wait! Wait! I’ll slit your guts!</p>
<p><strong>full down shot – the skiff, then preacher</strong>: The
current catches it and spins it round like a leaf. JOHN’s efforts with
the oars are useless. PREACHER enters, wading fast. His hands are within
an inch of reaching the helpless skiff; capriciously the current takes
it downstream.</p>
<p><strong>two-shot – john and pearl</strong>: The skiff is taken
steadily by the current. PEARL sits up, doll in arms. JOHN is almost
asleep with exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – the skiff, over preacher</strong>: It is well
away from him and getting smaller. Waist-deep, he wades a couple of
steps after it, then just looks.</p>

finds the new page she’s after, and spreads her hands flat on the pages.
She never glances at the text. She is fishing for JOHN.</p>

Egyptland! And he had a daughter, and once upon a time… … she was

Jesus.</p>

about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?</p>

sportily under one arm, talks into wall phone which hangs just within

puts her gun beside the stove, ready to hand, and picks up a coffee-
pot; JOHN puts kindling in stove.</p>

more endurance than God is ever to grant you again? Children are Man at
his strongest. They abide.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – through police car windshield</strong>: We SHOOT
OVER TWO TROOPERS. Sirens loud, they rapidly approach RACHEL’s house as
RACHEL, without gun, holding JOHN’s hand, comes down to fence.
Presently, the other CHILDREN hurry out of house behind. The car
brakes.</p>
<p><strong>full shot – rachel and children over two police cars – barn
in background</strong>: The TROOPERS, fanning wide, advance towards the
barn. RACHEL and the CHILDREN are grouped a short distance behind them.
The barn door gapes black. Short pause; then PREACHER appears.</p>
<p><strong>a trooper</strong>: Is that him, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes! Mind where you shoot, boys! There’s
children here!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Whyn’t you call us up before?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Didn’t want yer big feet trackin’ up my
clean floors.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – preacher</strong>: He stands, swaying; his left
arm is bloody and helpless. In his right hand the open knife hangs
apathetic. His eyes are glazed. He does not seem to care whether they
come or not.</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – preacher and troopers – john’s
viewpoint</strong>: TROOPERS close in on PREACHER, from before and

feverish people, some of whom carry torches, enter the scene; ICEY
stares in the window and screams.</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Them’s hers!</p>
<p><strong>icey</strong>: Them’s her orphans!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where’s Ruby?</p>

friends!</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Go out the back way, Miz Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>ext. back alley – night – panning shot – rachel and

<p><strong>clary</strong>: Ain’t we goin’ to the Bus Depot?</p>

mud of his soul!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Come on!</p>

Now there are no mob voices; only the ominous sound of fifty-odd people

<p><strong>ruby</strong>: I love him!</p>

<p><strong>voices</strong>: Bust down the door! Set fahr to it! Where’s

<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m glad they didn’t send me nothing!
Whenever they do it’s never nothing I want but something to show me how
fancy and smart they’ve come up in the world.</p>
<p><strong>int. rachel’s kitchen</strong>: It is decorated for
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>group shot – rachel and children</strong>: Rachel enters; the
four girls stand in line, packages ready; JOHN stands in b.g., in
doorway to next room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can we give you your presents now?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shoot! You don’t mean to say you got me a
present?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shoot now!</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john – new angle</strong>: From a fruit bowl, he
selects the biggest apple, shines it on his shirt, wraps it in the doily
under his bowl, opens a drawer and gets out a clip clothes-pin, clips
his package, and leaves SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And much neater than last year’s, Ruby!</p>

framed by Christmas garland in b.g.; banging pots about and stirring;
praying as she works, which is the best way to pray. Appropriate noise,
o.s., of opening presents.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Lord save little children! You’d think the
world would be ashamed to name such a day as Christmas for one of them…
… and then go on the same old way. My soul is humble when I see the way
little ones accept their lot. Lord save little children! The wind blows
and the rain is cold. Yet, they abide…</p>
<p><strong>medium shot – john – rachel’s viewpoint</strong>: JOHN stands
in next room, looking at something in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>close shot – john – in other room</strong>: We see he holds a
watch. He looks like any boy, rich or poor, with his first watch.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: For every child, rich or poor, there’s a
time of running through a dark place; and there’s no word for a child’s
fear. A child sees a shadow on the wall, and sees a Tiger. And the old
ones say, “There’s no Tiger; go to sleep.” And when that child sleeps,
it’s a Tiger’s sleep, and a Tiger’s night, and a Tiger’s breathing on
the windowpane. Lord save little children!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That watch sure is a fine, loud ticker!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’ll be nice to have someone around the
