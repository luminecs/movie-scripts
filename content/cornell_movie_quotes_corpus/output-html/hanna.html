<h1 id="hanna">hanna</h1>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I just missed your heart. She stands and
pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster. She fires two shots
directly at CAMERA.</p>
<p>****: Remove the penis and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around
the rectum. HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket.</p>
<p>****: Cut from the rear to the brisket. She works calmly without
expression.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’re dead. Right now. I’ve killed you. HANNA
spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to
ERIK’s face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA’s shoulder
sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims
a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for
her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Use your hands! She goes for the gun again and
again he stops her. He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster
and tossing it deep into the forest. HANNA clips ERIK’S temple sending
him to the ground. She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap…
… but she can’t. He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.
ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows a touch of
frustration. He plods into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Drag it back yourself. HANNA drags herself to
the deer’s side. She stares at its dead face.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: What’s wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling
her spoon.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You were half asleep.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’ll do better next time.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: German.</p>
<p>****: I’ll do better next time.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Italian.</p>
<p>****: I’ll do better next time.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Spanish. HANNA studies her food and slowly
takes a spoonful.</p>
<p>****: Spanish.</p>
<p>****: Did you really want me to snap your neck? He looks at her -
drops the quiz.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How much did you pull off the deer?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: A hundred and twenty with scraps.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: About 200 pounds in total? HANNA nods.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: That explains it.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: How you beat me. You’re getting strong. HANNA
almost blushes. ERIK stands to put his bowl away.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I’m glad you didn’t snap my neck.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The Great Blue Whale is the largest animal to
have ever existed. A blue whale’s tongue weighs over two and a half tons
and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How much is that?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s bigger than the cabin. Its heart weighs
thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles. HANNA
smirks.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The Blue Whale’s “music” can be heard for over
500 miles. He shuts the book.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Time for sleep.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Good night. He stands by her bed looking down
at her.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Did you forget something?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. ERIK takes HANNA’S gun out of his pocket
and puts it on the table next to her bed.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Good night. He walks to the door. HANNA stops
him with a question.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s music like?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s difficult to explain.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs
through the pages and reads.</p>
<p>****: ‘Music. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form
and expression of emotion’.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to
answer such esoteric questions.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Good. It feels good. It’s, uh, nice.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Tell me properly. Can you play music?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Your mother could. She used to sing very
well.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’d like to hear it for myself.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You will soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How soon? Erik looks away from her
questioning eyes.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: When you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m ready. I’m ready already. They look at
each other- he weighs it up.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Just go to sleep now. I’ll see you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Again. They reset. She repeats the motion.
Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Again. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist. She’s getting
faster. Her strikes are solid.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I live in Leipzig. German city. Population
0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school
at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and
Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and
athletics. I have a dog called Trudi.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Don’t give up! Don’t give up! HANNA’s arms
flails as she fights against the stream and she screams in pain. She is
grabbed under by the undertow and is pulled downwards. For a second she
is underwater and in darkness but ERIK’s hand pulls her back up and she
breaks the surface with a gasp of relief.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I didn’t need your help.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m ready now.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Maybe. ERIK relaxes. It’s a false beat. He
lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be really trying to
hurt her. But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint
knife - in an instant it is at ERIK’s neck. She pricks his neck
slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and silence. HANNA
breathless, angry.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You didn’t tell me you had a knife.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You told me to think for myself. Isn’t that
what you want? She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer.
Just stares at her.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I want to see things. I can’t stay here
forever.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: One, two, three, four…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: …five, six, seven, eight…</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: …nine, ten. After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90
degree turn and enters the tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his
boots. We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of
HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All the while we
continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces. After 40 paces, with the
cabin light distant, ERIK falls to his knees. He unsheathes a large
knife and jams it into the frozen earth.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Hello little foxy… foxy loxy… come on… come
and share my breakfast. The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the
scrap, withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward
carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Did you see it? Wasn’t it beautiful, like
thunder. I had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. Did you
hear it? She stops, sensing ERIK’S mood.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s wrong? Sitting in front of ERIK is a
metal case, caked with frozen dirt. ERIK pops open the case. Inside a
tangle of technology. HANNA looks at the case, mesmerized.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What does it do?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He
looks at her, a hint of a challenge.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: When you want to leave here all you have to do
is flip that switch. She approaches the box and places a single finger
on the small red switch.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: But once it’s done, there’ll be no going back.
She’ll never give up until you’re dead, or she is. You understand? I
wont be there to hold your hand. So be sure. Be sure it’s what you
really want.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You’re not scaring me. He looks at her
disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves
away from the switch. He softens towards her.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s here. There’s no rush. Take your time.
HANNA turns her back on the box, but can’t help taking another look at
it over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of
Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into
outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans
would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by
animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her
rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been
intended to die.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That’s sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to
change subject.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: When a star collapses the supernova explosion
is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and
tries to imagine how bright that might be.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it’s
waiting for her.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to
sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box. She
stops sweeping and looks at the box. She turns and walks out of the
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Marissa Wiegler.</p>
<p>****: Come and find me. CLOSE ON - She flips the switch, a little red
light begins to flash. An ALARM CLOCK begins to ring as we cut to -</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You were lucky to grab that deer. There was
nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is
preparing.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Smells good. He wraps an arm around her
shoulder. They don’t hug much and it shows. HANNA is almost defensive
and tense. And then the hug is over.</p>
<p><strong>marissa wiegler.</strong>: Her young male PA and TECH ONE are
already waiting for her.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: Ma’am. We’ve had a signal reported by
Interpol. We think it’s Eric Heller. An unusual expression of shock on
MARISSA’S face.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Well I’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: It seems he’s in Sweden. Jokkmokk. 40
miles out.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What the fuck is he doing there?</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: Living in the middle of nowhere, like the
frigging Una Bomber.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: The son of a bitch. Sweden? Sweden?! The PA
hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: Apparently he turned on his locator.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: He’s not an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>tech one</strong>: I know… I mean I believe so. But that’s
what happened.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe he’d
rather go to prison.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Eric Heller. From the Czech Republic. I
recruited him in 1991 when they were all joining the Velvet Revolution
and sticking it to the commies ERIK, now clean shaven, opens a wooden
case in the corner of the room and takes out an old folded three piece
suit and rolled shirt.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: He couldn’t wait to kiss some yankee butt
and make some bucks doing our dirty work. ERIK awkwardly begins to
change into the suit.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Trouble was he had his own way of doing
things. Kinda paranoid. WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He
uses an access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the
tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER. He clicks on a
link. HELLER’s face pops on to the screen.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Not a team player. Not a “joiner.” He
became increasingly isolated and disturbed. Kept mouthing off about
classified programmes. WALT clicks on a link to a newspaper article
which comes on to the screen: The headline: POLICE HUNT FOR MURDER
SUSPECT. A picture of Heller in the article and a smashed car on a rural
road. The two men stare at his face.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I kept warning and he kept getting worse.
In the summer of 1995 he took his girlfriend, Johanna Zadek, on a trip
to the Baltic coast and blew her head off. WALT hits a new link: A still
of the same young woman as the photo HANNA was previously looking at in
her bedroom. Her name printed below it: JOHANNA ZADEK.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Never heard from him again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Anybody know why?</p>
<p>****: Maybe the pressure got to him, Bob. You know what that’s
like.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: What do you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What do you mean? Call the police,</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: - Walt. This is exactly the kind of shit we
can’t have out there anymore. He was one of ours, we trained him. He
kills some other poor woman and it’s a cluster fuck.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Tell it to Interpol. Let them pick him up. Try
him for murder.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s right. This has nothing to do with us. I
don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You don’t have to. I’m making the call. BOB
and WALT exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Thank you, Gentlemen. That’ll be all. The
video screen flickers off, people take their files and start to leave.
MARISSA WIEGLER stands in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hanna… HANNA looks up, still trying to hide
her fear.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Tell me again?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Marissa Weigler.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Then?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Postcard.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Then?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: The address where we meet.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Wilhelm Grimm’s house. Stephanstrasse 260.
10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA’S
forehead and looks at her with paternal care.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Good night my sweet girl. He stands and
quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Father… He turns to look at her, both their
eyes full of trepidation.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You can do this. You’re ready. Just remember
what I’ve taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’ll see you there.</p>
<p><strong>special ops</strong>: Is this guy one of ours?</p>
<p><strong>head of ops</strong>: Used to be. Tread carefully, he’s been
in there a long time, he’s damaged goods, and he knows we’re coming. We
see through the infra-red vision the endless trees in the pitch
blackness. The SPECIAL OPS FORCES get closer. They see the cabin in the
night. They approach. Silence in the darkness. Just the breathing of men
in the icy cold.</p>
<p><strong>head of ops</strong>: McCullum? Do you read me? No
response.</p>
<p><strong>head of ops</strong>: I repeat, do you read me? The HEAD of
OPS waves all thirty of his men closer to the cabin. Guns at the ready.
The HEAD of OPS and five other men storm the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Ma’am, this is Lewis. MARISSA affects a
“business as usual” tone.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: The target escaped.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: How did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We’re thinking maybe he got away in the snow,
in the thick snow, or… But he’s in the wind and I have two men down.</p>
<p>****: Find him, Lewis. Find him and take him out.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Ma’am. There’s more. They found a child, his
daughter. MARISSA turns pale.</p>
<p><strong>on closed circuit television:</strong>: A cement box. HANNA
lies on a small bed. Not moving. Two American voices.</p>
<p><strong>voice 1</strong>: She hasn’t moved since we brought her
in.</p>
<p><strong>voice 2</strong>: Has anyone talked to her?</p>
<p><strong>voice 1</strong>: They want a psych evaluation before they
interrogate.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Hello Hanna. Hanna lies motionless.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: My name is Dr. Burton. Would you like to
talk to me? BURTON’S voice has been trained to engender a state of peace
and security. HANNA sits up and hangs her legs off the side of the
cot.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I was told by my father to gain the upper
hand.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Really. Interesting. What else did your
father tell you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: You’re in holding.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: This must all be very strange for you.
You’ve been in the forest a long time. But I want you to know no one’s
going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you about your father. HANNA
seems to be staring up at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Hanna? He follows her eye-line to the CCTV
camera above them.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Is that a camera?</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Ah, yes, that’s a camera. To keep a
record.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Camera obscura, it’s Latin for “dark
chamber”.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Extension
247. MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and speaks
into it.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: You should have visual on the psych
evaluation now.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It was first described by the Arabic
scientist Ibn Alhazen in the year 1021.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What’s she saying?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Gobbledygook.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Can I get you something? What do you like?
Music? Magazines? Just say. Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Did you hear that? MARISSA pauses before she
answers.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Tell her I’ll be there tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 1</strong>: John come and take a look at this
kid’s blood sample. MILITARY DOCTOR 2 walks across. He sees the sample
on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 2.</strong>: Is that right? That can’t be
right.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 1</strong>: And I got a sample of her hair.
MILITARY DOCTOR 2 looks at the results, baffled.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 2</strong>: That must be contamination.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 1</strong>: What contamination? What would it
be?</p>
<p><strong>military doctor 2</strong>: Run it again.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: My name is Marissa Wiegler. You
wanted to speak to me? HANNA turns to look. It is a completely different
woman, dressed in similar clothes to MARISSA but not her.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: You can wait outside. The guards exit
and the door slams shut behind them.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: You should have visual.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: You’re in a safe place. Let’s talk
about your father. You must love him very much.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where did you meet him? The false MARISSA
pauses.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Tell her it was by a news kiosk in
Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it was raining.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: At a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. In
the rain. She smiles reassuringly. HANNA nods, looking at FALSE</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>military doctor</strong>: Sir we need to talk to you. We’ve
run tests on the girl. His voice sounds urgent, concerned. But Marissa
has interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What tests? As the argument continues, we
see and hear on the screen the FALSE MARISSA continuing to talk to
HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: Do you know where your father is? In
the OBS room LEWIS, half watching the screen, explains to MARISSA on
intercom.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Standard DNA and meds.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Send the results straight to me. On the
screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: Did he tell you where he was going?
We’re all worried about him. On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE
MARISSA. She begins to cry, holds out her arms to be held.</p>
<p><strong>monitor</strong>: Sir look. LEWIS looks at HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: It’s OK. It’s OK. HANNA coils her
thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA’S neck, clinging to her like a
monkey. The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly
concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better grip…</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: You want me to give her something?</p>
<p><strong>false marissa</strong>: I think it might be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Get her out of there.</p>
<p><strong>burton</strong>: Open up. The first guard opens HANNA’S
door.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Abort. I repeat. Abort.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Jee-sus wept! On another screen LEWIS watches
as the other Guard tries to drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy
door jam - Burton. Hanna is upon him. Two shots.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: She’s a child for Christsake!</p>
<p><strong>female guard</strong>: This is Sanders. I’m checking Zone
eleven. The FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses something.
POV SANDERS - The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The buzz of the
lab’s lighting and the whir of the air- pressurizes are the only sounds
as the GUARD looks around. Then the GUARD hears a rustling from behind
her and tenses up. She turns around but HANNA has vanished into thin
air, there is silence.</p>
<p><strong>monitor</strong>: You think she’s out?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: She can’t get out. LEWIS picks up an internal
telephone.</p>
<p>****: Who’s on the perimeter? Detail every unit available.</p>
<p><strong>military voice</strong>: 473 are you receiving me? Can you
confirm your position. Subject has escaped.</p>
<p><strong>military voice</strong>: Can you confirm your position 473?
Banks? Banks can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>banks.</strong>: I’m at a perimeter opening at the far east
wing. Something’s not quite right… He doesn’t notice but the lid is open
now and the air- conditioning duct is empty.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is
clinging to the axle, hanging upside down underneath. Her face is
pressed to the oily metal, her back just an inch from the desert floor
flashing beneath her. The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a
steep dune. HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip. She clenches
her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her. As soon as the jeeps clears
she rolls herself over the edge of the dune. HANNA rolls down the sand
dune at speed until finally she slows and stops. She lies still and
shocked by the quiet as the Jeep disappears into the distance. Then she
sits up and looks around herself. She has no conception of this
landscape, no idea where she might be.</p>
<p><strong>present day.</strong>: MARISSA puts on a pair of rubber
kitchen gloves and sets fire to the file in the sink. When it’s all
burnt up she switches on the garbage disposal and pushes the ashen
remains down the gurgler with a dish mop.</p>
<p>****: I live in Leipzig. German city… 0.7 Million people… I go to
school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium… literature and sport… I have a dog
called Trudi.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hello. HANNA stares at her, then abruptly
turns to walk in opposite direction until she sees another convoy of US
military trucks in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: All right? HANNA turns back. Looks at
SOPHIE. Like a wary animal.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Don’t you speak English? HANNA is unsure how
to speak to this strange person.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: That can’t be helped. You look terrible. At
that moment SOPHIE’S brother, MILES, eight years old, rises over the
dune and stands by SOPHIE’S side. In his hand is a stills camera, not
digital, film. MILES stares at HANNA while talking to SOPHIE.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Who’s she?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I don’t know. I just found her.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: She can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She talked.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I live in Leipzig. German city. Population
0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school
at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and
Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and
athletics.</p>
<p>****: She’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I also have a dog called Trudi.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We had a dog called Vincent, but he went mad
and died.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’m Sophie and this is my brother, Shit for
Brains. From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES’S mother,
RACHEL LYALL.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come on, Sophie! We’ll miss the light. MILES
raises his camera to his eye and snaps a picture of</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: See you. SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look
at HANNA, then turns and disappears over the sand dune. HANNA rises to
the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Do you need a lift somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. I prefer to walk.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: She’s in the desert east of Essouiara.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Have you got the DNA results?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: We can’t find them. It’s possible she has
them on her. Marissa takes that in.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Okay. I want you to focus on Erik
Heller.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Why? A sweet-faced male AIR STEWARD hovers
over MARISSA.</p>
<p><strong>air steward</strong>: Excuse Madame, airline regulations
state that -</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m in conference.</p>
<p><strong>air steward</strong>: All the same -</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Back off, honey. I’m busy. MARISSA’S
response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD instinctively does as he’s
told.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: You know this isn’t going to go away.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m dealing with it Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Okay but I just want you to admit - my Lord -
how did she know to ask for you? She hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Where’s your family?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are you Arab?</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: I’m Moroccan.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of
interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic</p>
<p>****: I like Arabic very much. It’s like Japanese. It’s big. The
HOTEL OWNER nearly spits out his biscuit in shock.</p>
<p>****: You speak Arabic?</p>
<p>****: Yes, of course.</p>
<p>****: Where’s your family?</p>
<p>****: I need a room for one night. Can you help? I don’t have any
money.</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: It’s the best we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Thank you. HANNA stares at the light
switch.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Do you have one of these in every room?</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Of course. All mod cons.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at
HANNA askance.</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I know a little bit about electricity. They
say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin?</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Some American, I’m sure. He picks up an
electric kettle.</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Electric kettle for the English - they
like to make their own tea. He switches it on, Hanna stares as it heats
up noisily. He goes to a small wall mounted TV, switches it on for her,
a fuzzy, terrible picture of an Arabic TV show. HANNA is fascinated,
doesn’t take her eyes off the TV as she sits on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: It’s the best we can do. She stares at
the picture, bemused.</p>
<p><strong>hotel owner</strong>: Where do you come from? Distracted,
HANNA is caught off guard.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a
little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits
there staring at the TV as it’s volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the
electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole
contraption starts to rattle violently.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Look. It’s that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA
eyes them suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hey you made it.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey, again.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Did you walk here?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She looks different.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Do you want to hang with us?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Miles is always hungry.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: The Swedish borders are sealed. I have
Swedish, Norwegian and Danish border patrols on high alert and Interpol
have briefed the police.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I don’t want any bad news Lewis. Neither of
us can afford a fuck up. MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car
park which is now a lap dancing bar. It’s early in the day and the
patrons are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers. At the far end of
the room is the reason Marissa is there, MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties.
Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven and drinking a scotch. ISAACS smiles
coldly at MARISSA.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: I didn’t think they let women in here.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: They let them in, they just don’t let them
get dressed. He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Still drinking on the job. You haven’t
changed.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: You have.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Adapt or die.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’ll wait until I really need one. He grins
and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Erik Heller’s still alive. ISAACS glances
up from his drink.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: There’s more. MARISSA passes him a
newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is a picture of Hanna. He looks it
over, surprised.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Wow. All grown up.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: He did a good job.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Did she turn out like you hoped?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: She just tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Isn’t it always the way?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: The fuck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: You bring them into this world, teach them
how to kill and maim… and then they turn against you.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I didn’t teach her.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: No, it’s better than that. You bred her from
a test tube. MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the
scotches, “Two of these…”</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Here’s the problem: She thinks we killed
her mother. He smiles wryly.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Just get her sectioned or something.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Sure, just as soon as she’s done breaking
peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks
arrive, MARISSA drinks.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Right now she’s in Morocco but she’ll be
trying to get out of the country. Find her and bring her to me.
Quietly.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: I’ll need funds. MARISSA slides an envelope
of bills across the table.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Don’t spend it all on candy. She glances
meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been eyeing up ISAACS as a
potential mark. ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA
is already walking out the door.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: She’s beautiful. I wish I had a body like
hers. She’s really cool too. She’s married to a footballer and really
loves him -</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: - only the papers found out he was shagging
like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own
right and now does a make-over show where she turns right dogs into real
babes. I could do you a make-over if you’d like?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Perhaps Hanna doesn’t want a make- over,
sweetie. SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Rachel doesn’t believe in making the best of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No Sophie, I just don’t believe fourteen
year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It
objectifies them.</p>
<p>****: Do you shave your armpits yet?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good. Keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: That’s SOOO gross.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you often travel on your own, Hanna?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: My father encourages me to be
independent.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: And your mother?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Nice one, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: People die.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: What did she die of?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Three bullets.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh. God. How terrible. SOPHIE is weirdly
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Three pounds of goose fat if you please.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Why do we always have to get up so
early?</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: If you were a Berber shepherd -</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: - I’m not a shepherd. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We have to be at the port by eight tomorrow
so I want you to pack now…</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’m too sleepy. HANNA listens anxiously,
knowing she needs to go with them to be safe. She arrives at her
door.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Good night. But the family are too wrapped up
in their discussion to notice her.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: No, you’re not. Come on we’ll do it together.
HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA’S door
closing.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: She’s weird. Is it me, or is that girl
weird?</p>
<p><strong>result�</strong>: HANNA stares at the words. “Interfering
sequence present. Abnormal.” HANNA looks at the photo of herself and
those words.</p>
<p><strong>�abnormal�</strong>: What does it mean? She looks up at the
TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim worshipers circling the Kaaba
at Mecca. The sheer mass of humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the
volume and hears the call to prayer. She listens in wonder to her first
experience of music.</p>
<p>****: Music. A combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form
and expression of emotion. She breathes in the beautiful sounds.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: … Somebody broke the sun roof. I said somebody
broke the sun roof. It won’t close…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Call the rental.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: I hope its insured.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Typical. Get me back to the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t be rude. They get out, taking with
them anything they might need - knapsacks, computer games, suit cases.
They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing ISAACS on
their way. ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks. He passes the
back of the FAMILY’S van as the camera pushes in on its back door. The
handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What has got into you? Oh my God, look over
there. They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It’s her.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: You think she… you don’t think she… Rachel, the
sunroof?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You think we should say something?</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: What’s there to say?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Maybe she’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Maybe she’s a hooker. Or a terrorist. There’s a
lot of them in Germany.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hookers or terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll go over.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Rachel, walk away. I’m insisting here. I’m
putting my foot down… RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE
follows.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: SOPHIE and RACHEL approach HANNA and move
to positions either side of her.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: All right?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Did you know that 71 percent of the earths
surface is covered in water?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: My father thinks you’re a stowaway. He
thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep shit.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sophie just - I’ll handle this.</p>
<p>****: Where’s your father? No reply.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I really think it might help if you told us
the, you know, the truth and all that. Have you run away from
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: She said she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You have to understand this really is a
problem for us.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You know what? Why don’t I stay here with
her and you go off and be with dad? He’s looking kind of tense.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: RACHEL rejoins SEB and MILES.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Has she even got a passport?!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t think I handled that very well.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: How do you know she’s not some kind of illegal
immigrant?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Would you like some? HANNA looks curiously
at the ice-cream.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Please. She tries it.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It tastes like music.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You’re so weird, aren’t you? Did you have a
fight with your dad or something?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Was it bad?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. I won. HANNA studies the sea.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Can you help me get home? At that moment one
of ISAACS photocopied pictures of HANNA rolls across the deck and
catches on the railings. HANNA looks down at it, recognizes herself and
quickly pockets it. She looks across the deck, too many people, she
shouldn’t have let herself be so exposed.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You could do me a make-over if you like?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You’re pretty. You know that?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Of course you are. You’ve got pretty eyes
and you’re tall. I always wanted to be tall. If I were a man I might
fancy you. She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m not a man. SOPHIE laughs even more. The
door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL, nervous but
determined.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Okay, here’s the deal. We’re going to find a
way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate. But since you
don’t have a passport with you right now, we’re just going to have to be
a bit gorilla. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We passionately believe it’s the right thing
to do. They don’t look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round HANNA
and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You okay honey?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes yes I’m ready! ISAACS is getting closer,
walking between the cars. The ferry gates are open and the noise
subsides. SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Oh Jesus. HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in
the box, helps SEB fling cushions aside and gets into the
compartment.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Here goes nothing. He shuts the bench seat over
HANNA and replaces the cushions just as ISAACS passes the van, sniffing
around. SEB gets out of the back and walks around to the front. He
passes ISAACS on his way round.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Excuse me. Sir? ISAACS gets out of the way and
SEB gets into the front passenger’s seat. RACHEL starts the engine,
checks her mirrors. SEB eyes ISAACS with some paranoia - although he has
no idea who he is.</p>
<p><strong>inside hanna’s hide out -</strong>: HANNA lies quietly, her
eyes glistening in the dark. She listens, hearing the van disembarking
the ferry.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Sir, I’ll be as brief as I can, we have a
situation here…</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: The Danish authorities are taking this very
seriously. They’ve doubled the number of officers on the ground. We’ve
sent up spotter planes over the channel.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: They’re appealing for witnesses through the
local media… MARISSA nods and looks out at the roiling grey sea. The
reality of ERIK’S determination unnerving her.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: You think he really swam it? MARISSA knows he
did. She calls over her shoulder as she walks away.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Keep me posted.</p>
<p><strong>german camper.</strong>: Guten tag.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Guten Morgen.</p>
<p><strong>german camper.</strong>: Wie geht es Ihnen?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Gutm und Ihnen?</p>
<p><strong>german camper.</strong>: Jah, gut, gut… A FRENCH CAMPER nods
at them.</p>
<p><strong>french camper.</strong>: Bonjour. Ca va?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Ca va. Oui. Bien… HANNA starts efficiently
helping SEB erect the children’s tent. He’s watches impressed as HANNA
expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two
inflatable mattresses.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Maybe we could all go for a walk when we’ve
put the tent up.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line.
In the distance she spots a couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>boys.</strong>: One of the boys enters the shop. He looks at
HANNA as he passes and smiles. This is FELICIANO. He is handsome.
HANNA’S not used to this feeling of being looked at. While the SHOP
ASSISTANT serves FELICIANO HANNA pockets a postcard and a book of
stamps.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I just feel connected when I’m in the
countryside. The city stifles me… emotionally, creatively. HANNA’S
attention is elsewhere, she’s spotted something in the undergrowth.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Anyway, I was very young when I… Seb and I….
He was so impressive. HANNA suddenly runs into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hanna?!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It’s probably just a bunch of Spanish
farmers, mum. We’re hardly going to be out all night.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re not going, Sophie. No way, Jose.
HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS. She lays them
in front of the family.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous
laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate
reaction might be.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: That’s gross.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I don’t know why I’m doing this, you’re
going to steal all the best men off of me.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Though quite frankly I don’t need more
digits than I’ve got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches
herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She licks the lipstick,
puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn’t look right on her.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s like paint.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Don’t lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA’s
face, looks at her in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You’re gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I can’t walk in this.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You look hot.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I shouldn’t take unnecessary risks.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Says who? SOPHIE heads off down the road.
HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to catch up with
SOPHIE.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The girls approach a bar and SOPHIE goes to
order. She’s forced to mime and shout her order over the music.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Vodka. Two.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Water only. No booze. Meanwhile HANNA
spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY from the camp site shop,
across the dance floor. He is staring at her again. SOPHIE comes back
with two bottles of water and hands one to</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What do they call this music?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Banging. HANNA stares at the dancers, people
losing themselves in it - SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the
music. HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ISAACS enters the rave followed by two of
his HENCHMEN. They split up and start to survey the crowd. Over in a
secluded corner ISAACS sees a drug deal taking place. ISAACS sidles over
to the DEALER and his PUNTER. The PUNTER, thinking ISAACS is probably a
cop, makes a hasty getaway.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p>****: Nothing man. That guys just a friend. ISAACS frisks the DEALER,
nothing. He turns the DEALER against the wall and checks his socks where
he finds a stash of tiny baggies each containing a gram or two of white
powder. ISAACS samples the powder and pockets the lot.</p>
<p>****: Hey, you’re not police. What the fuck? ISAACS turns as he walks
away and puts a finger to his lips.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Ssh.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Back near the bar HANNA and SOPHIE are
approached by a couple of scrawny SPANISH BOYS in day-glow tops.</p>
<p>****: Where are you from? The girls just look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>spanish boy</strong>: English? American? You like to party?
They watch, puzzled, as SOPHIE smiles disinterestedly and leads HANNA
away.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Will you teach me to do dancing?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It’s easy. HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the
dance floor and begin to dance. HANNA starts by dancing like a five
year-old, swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking
through a field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and
expressive.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ISAACS is searching through the crowd. He
eyes the bodies around him greedily. He takes another dab of the white
powder and rubs it into his gums.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Back on the dance floor, HANNA and SOPHIE
are dancing. FELICIANO approaches through the crowd followed by a
FRIEND. THEY start to circle HANNA and SOPHIE, dancing, insinuating
their way in.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: He’s after you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Duh, look at the way he’s looking at you.
He’s gorgeous. FELICIANO’S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he’s not bad
looking either.</p>
<p><strong>feliciano’s friend</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>feliciano’s friend</strong>: Have you come here before?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: All the time.</p>
<p><strong>feliciano’s friend</strong>: Really? You dance well.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: So do you. HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye
contact. The music rises and now they’re lit only by the intermittent
flashes of a strobe light. HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around
each other, their movements caught in still flashes.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: From some distance away ISAACS spots HANNA.
He smiles and starts to move through the crowds towards her.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: SOPHIE and the FRIEND are kissing. HANNA
sees this and laughs. The crowd is jumping. HANNA feels FELICIANO’S hand
take hers, she flinches a moment, then lets him draw her towards him.
Their eyes still locked. ISAACS is getting closer, his eyes flashing
eerily in the strobe lighting. HANNA and FELICIANO are in a world of
their own. His fingers trace the lines of her arms, shoulders and neck.
He draws her face towards his.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are we going to kiss now?</p>
<p><strong>feliciano</strong>: Would you like to?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Kissing requires a total of thirty- four
facial muscles. Their lips are almost touching.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The most important muscle involved is the
orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips - He kisses
her. HANNA closes her eyes. ISAACS moves in. FELICIANO becomes more
ardent, puts his arms around her waist, she doesn’t like it. He tries to
open her mouth with his. HANNA snaps. In a few swift moves, HANNA pulls
FELICIANO round and throws him to the ground. She falls to his side and,
with one knee on his back, she holds his head, about to snap his neck.
SOPHIE turns and sees them on the ground. A few of the closest DANCERS
also stop dancing and stare. ISAACS backs off, watching from a safe
distance.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hanna! Holy crap…</p>
<p><strong>feliciano</strong>: Please, don’t hurt me.</p>
<p>****: Please, tell your friend… HANNA looks up at SOPHIE. Now that
she has FELICIANO on the ground she doesn’t know what to do with
him.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Should I let him go?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: As opposed to what? Yes, you should let him
go. HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO’S ear.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m going to go now.</p>
<p><strong>feliciano</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It was nice. And she’s gone, pulling SOPHIE
away through the crowd. ISAACS jumps into action. But he’s lost sight of
the girls among the mass of dancing bodies. HANNA and SOPHIE move
quickly through the crowds towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you were going
to kill him. Where d’you learn to do that?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: My father taught me. They escape through a
hole in the perimeter fence.</p>
<p><strong>night</strong>: An immaculately tidy lounge in a small
apartment on the ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project.
A well-dressed woman in her 60’s, KATRIN, is sitting alone listening to
music on an old casette machine. The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up
slowly and approaches the door.</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: Who is it? No reply. KATRIN puts the safety
chain across the door and opens it a small amount.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Hello Katrin. KATRIN slams the door shut in
fright and double locks it. Fear racing through her veins, she rushes
her way through the lounge, knocking furniture as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: You look different in pictures.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Well here I am in the flesh. KATRIN’S mouth
twitches with all the imagined conversations she’s had with MARISSA.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Has Erik Heller contacted you?</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: Erik’s dead. MARISSA sits calmly in an old
arm chair.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Huh, if only.</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: If he’s alive why would he contact me?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: That depends on whether you believe he’s
innocent, or not.</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: I’m an old woman with a broken</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: - What’s in the past, stays in the past,
right?</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: So why all the years of snooping around and
sticking your nose in?</p>
<p><strong>katrin</strong>: You’d understand if you had kids. She turns
her back on MARISSA.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Kid’s, they fuck you up, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Can’t you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Me neither. SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hanna?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Where do you really come from?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses
her patience.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: If we’re going to be friends you have to be
honest with me. Them’s the rules. HANNA is taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are we friends?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Yes. I like you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’d like to have a friend.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I mean you’re a freak and everything, but I
like you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I like you too. I really do. But there are
things I can’t tell you. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Yes… Actually, no, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: There are people that want to harm me. Bad
people.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: And they wont stop.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: So for your own safety… HANNA looks into
SOPHIE’S eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Can we still be friends?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I don’t know. I mean, I don’t really know
who you are. Do I?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That’s just it. Neither do I. She reaches
into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it to Sophie. They read.
Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I think it’s about me. DNA is kind of how
we’re made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m going to Berlin. I have to meet my father
at the house of Wilhelm Grimm.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: As in “Grimm’s Fairytales”?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That’s right. SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Did I say the wrong thing again? SOPHIE looks
at HANNA, sees she’s vulnerable. She takes a bracelet off her own wrist.
Gives it to her.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Keep this. To remember me. HANNA takes it,
puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: It’s a friendship bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Thank you. HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks
over at SOPHIE who’s starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches
her hair. Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that
MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I need a room.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yes of course.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I stayed here fifteen years ago. It hasn’t
changed.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: We don’t much like change here.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Olsson. Peter Olsson.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You have some post. She turns and
retrieves HANNA’S POSTCARD from the mail rack and hands it to him.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Thank you. ERIK reads: “Mission
accomplished”</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Have you heard about the manhunt? A
man has killed two coastguards. Everybody is being asked to keep an eye
out.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: For what exactly?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I don’t know. He smiles. She takes a
closer look and notices goose fat smeared behind his ear.. and blood on
a shirt cuff…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How long until you drop me off?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We should have you there by dinner time.
From Lille you can get a train to Berlin. Leipzig’s just a few hours
further. HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Wake up. It’s them. He jumps in the
passenger seat whilst the driver revs the engine. The BMW pulls out in
front of an oncoming truck narrowly avoiding a collision.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Keep your distance.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Is that the police? Yes, I don’t want
to trouble you but I have a new guest you may wish to know about.</p>
<p><strong>cellphone.</strong>: HELLER makes a run for it. One of the
SPECIAL OPS lets off a shot, the bullet clipping HELLER in the leg. He
falters but limps off behind the towering containers.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: …they can live at freezing temperatures for
up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why do you know so much about fleas?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is
looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW and frowns, she’s
seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Also, they can jump around 200 times their
own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals
except for the froghopper. Now they can really jump. RACHEL makes a turn
and HANNA checks the side view mirror again. Yes, the BMW is still
there. HANNA becomes anxious.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I think so. But HANNA’S face betrays her
concern.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Mama, I know you’re disappointed in me, I
know it. I’m so sorry, Mama. But I have found maybe a way to make it
better…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’m in a program now… a program to make
babies stronger. In an adjoining bathroom MARISSA, in a pair of cotton
pyjamas, is brushing her teeth. Her lips pulled back in a snarl.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: An American program. It’s very scientific.
Important scientific work. Still brushing MARISSA walks through to the
tape machine and presses fast forward. Then play -</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Erik says he can get these tapes to</p>
<p>****: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: - He says I look beautiful. I don’t feel
beautiful… MARISSA doesn’t care, fast forwards. Play -</p>
<p><strong>johanna</strong>: …I’m not sure if it’s true that the baby
can hear, but at night I sing. I hope it hears me. MARISSA listens, for
some unknown reason to MARISSA this catches her imagination. The phone
rings.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I
have one Erik Heller for you. MARISSA stops dead.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Put him on.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You were supposed to be dead.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: So were you.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Well, here we are.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: How did you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I killed one of your men. Got his cellphone.
You’ve gotten soft.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: No, I just grew up. The world’s changed
since you died.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You got kids?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: No, I made choices.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hanna’s practically yours, you know? This goes
straight to an ache that’s been building in</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Not interested. But she is.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: She’s true and good and funny. Yeah, she’s
funny. She’s special. You should see her.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You’ll have to catch her first. The line goes
dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits quietly for a moment. Then
presses play again on the tape machine.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Was it like this for you, Mama? I think I
know what the baby looks like. I think it’s a girl – I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I wonder who she’ll be? I hope she’s smart.
I hope she’s a stronger person than I am.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think we’re lost,
Hanna. HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW.
She’s knows that whoever is driving that car is after her. She looks
back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably asleep. MILES’
fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m going to pull over.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I need to check the map.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why won’t that car pass? He has his lights
on high beam, I was doing everything I could to get out of the way…
SOPHIE wakes up in the back.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Are we stopped? I need to pee.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, I don’t want you going too far right
now.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I think you should stay where you are,
Sophie. HANNA doesn’t take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the
silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don’t move and neither does
HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make the first move.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hanna, what’s going on. Seb wake up.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: This is creepy. You’re creeping me out.</p>
<p>****: Are we in Lille?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m sorry. But you really mustn’t get out of
the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close
to</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What ever you do, don’t follow me. Promise
not to follow me.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hanna, tell me what’s going on or Seb will
go over to that car and find out.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Like fuck I will. Everyone stay put. Where’s my
phone?</p>
<p>****: Thank you for being my friend. HANNA looks back at the BMW. All
at once all four of the car doors open. In a flash, HANNA pulls open the
van’s side door and bolts from the van.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hanna! RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the
HENCHMEN chase after HANNA. The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers
window aiming his gun at her head. RACHEL screams.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Don’t be a silly girl, Hanna. You need to
come with me now. I know where your papa is. She listens.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: ISAACS, his gun in hand, calls out
again.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: He wants to talk to you, Hanna. He misses
you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The HENCHMAN appears directly behind HANNA.
HANNA double- kicks him in the chest.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Just take it easy. HANNA makes her decision
and runs straight at ISAACS. He stretches out his arms in an attempt to
catch her. She hits him like a bowling ball hitting the last pin and he
crashes to the ground. She rolls and springs to her feet. The HENCHMEN
follow but HANNA is too quick.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Would you please stop crying?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I’m not telling you anything.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Honey, your friend is in a lot of danger.
You need to help us find her.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: I don’t know where to find her! MARISSA
grits her teeth, shows SOPHIE a photo of FELICIANO.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: He knows you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: MARISSA now in RACHEL’S cell.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We gave her a ride because we thought she
was in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: But you knew she didn’t have a passport.
You smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She said she lived in Leipzig. She went to
the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. It
closed five years ago. Shock on Rachel’s face.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Did she give any idea of where she was
going? Rachel wracks her brains.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She said she was going home, to Leipzig. She
seemed lost. Like she needed taking care of. You understand. MARISSA
shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: This was Hanna’s mother, Joanna Zadek.
Fifteen years ago Hanna’s father shot her to death on a camping holiday
by the Baltic. RACHEL swallows, goes pale.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: MARISSA now in SEB’S cell.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: She was odd. I’ll give you that. Disconnected.
I mean I get on with most kids, you know, have a rapport. But, this one
-</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You know, Mr Lyall, it’s days like these
that I really hate my job.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: I’m sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: It’s a very, very difficult thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: But sometimes children are bad people
too.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you. MILES shrinks
from her touch.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Miles is a nice name. Are you a nice boy?
She strokes MILES’ hair and immediately he starts crying loudly. SEB
pounds on the wall from his cell.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Hey what’s going on in there? We don’t have to
put up with this! We’re in the EU, Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Three days ago Hanna’s father killed two
Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: He’s still at large and he’s still very
dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks
about it but clams up. Marissa notices.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: If you know anything at all, it’s vital you
tell us for her own safety. We are now very worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sophie? Still nothing. They all look at her.
MILES suddenly speaks.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She’s going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm’s
house.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You little bastard!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You fuckwad! SOPHIE slaps MILES over the
back of the head but SEB pushes her back.</p>
<p><strong>seb</strong>: Hey hey hey! Sophie for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: I’ve looked through Heller’s contacts from
the 1980’s. There’s no one called Wilhelm.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died
two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing
one of the photographs she took from KATRIN’S apartment. The photograph
shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a busy family amusement park.
Between ERIK and JOANNA is a clown, his arms around both of them. This
we will come to understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a
GRIMM’S</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: What the hell is this? MARISSA smiles
slightly.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Wilhelm’s house. Drive on.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Excuse me young lady? It is the man from
the photo, but twenty years older. Small, with a wiry intensity.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are you Wilhelm Grimm?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Not exactly, but it’ll do for now. Come
this way. He leads her inside.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: So you are Hanna. He puts out his hand to
shake.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: It’s very nice to meet you, Hanna. HANNA
smiles and shakes his hand, she likes him already. KNEPFLER studies her,
quietly moved by his memories.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: My real name is Knepfler. Herr Knepfler.
I’m an old friend of your father’s. I am a sort of “caretaker” here.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: No car park. You need a car park these
days, otherwise people wont come. But somebody has to watch over it…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: I like it too. Erik used to come here a
great deal.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Have you heard from him? He nods.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: You must wait. He will be here soon. HANNA
stares, not quite believing.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Please, sit down. HANNA sits at the old
kitchen table on a wooden bench, while KNEPFLER goes to the stove.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Would you like an egg? They’re fresh.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Please. HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and
swallows it raw. KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She
looks inside - some money, a passport, ID cards.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: You’ll need a fresh photograph. Don’t get
it wet. HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE ELKAN.
She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t really understand.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: ID. Identity. It tells people who you are.
She stares at the passport with the blank space for her photo.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: There is an apartment ready for you in the
south. Erik will come and the car will take you there today. You will
live there now.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Don’t you want to?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t know. I miss the forest. I miss my
home.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: That’s to be expected. But the city is so
exciting, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I suppose. She drinks her water,
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Did you know my mother?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: She was very gentle, she was very funny,
very talented - a singer - did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: She had your eyes. He smiles at her. She
here’s a noise outside and runs to look out the window. She sees ISAACS
BMW pull up outside the house followed by a second car.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s him.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Quick. KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Upstairs. There’s a knock at the door.
HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches the front
door. There’s another knock at the door.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Listen to me, listen. There is no one
here. There is nobody up there…</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Check the attic. Footsteps to the
attic.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Erik Heller? Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: I have never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of
JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER outside the house.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: I don’t know these people.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA
grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks in gasps.</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: He called me. She’s coming soon. To meet
him.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>knepfler</strong>: Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning. MARISSA lets
him go. She turns to ISAACS.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Take him in there. Find out what he
knows.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Lewis. It’s Marissa. HANNA hears the name.
The name of the woman she thought she had killed. Her face pale in shock
and fear.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You got anything? He’s coming here. I can
smell it. Double the men. But, Lewis, I want to talk to him. HANNA hears
MARISSA hang. Another pair of shoes enter the room. Male. ISAACS.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: His name’s Klaus Knepfler. He used to send
Heller’s things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of
Prague.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: How much does he know about the
programme?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Everything. He knew Johanna.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What does he know about the child?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: He also thinks Erik’s the father.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Well that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Everybody thinks Erik’s her father. Erik
probably thinks he’s her father. They snigger. HANNA’s eyes widen in
shock. She can barely control her breath.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him
yet?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Let’s see what else Knepfler has to offer.
He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she hear an intake
of breath? She turns and quickly looks under the bed. No one there. Her
imagination maybe. MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the
door. They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid-
air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes. Hurriedly she
climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Excuse me. You have to pay first.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: 3 Euros for half an hour. She looks at the
money that Knepfler gave her. It contains Euros. She hands some over to
the OWNER.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: You’ve never used the internet?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. He smiles in amazement and logs on for
her. The owner brings up a search engine.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Just type whatever it is you’re looking for
here. He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Isaacs. He listens. Puts the phone down.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: A public computer at a Berlin internet cafe
just did a web search for “DNA Interfering Sequence”.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Hanna?</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Next they searched the name Johanna
Zadek.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: She’s not coming here.</p>
<p><strong>projects - day</strong>: HANNA gets out of the taxi and looks
up at an enormous grey housing block - the Heizinger building. She
approaches the entrance and looks on all the buzzers. Sees a name
scrawled on one - Number 14. Zadek. She presses the buzzer. Waits. No
answer. A GANG OF KURDISH YOUTHS come out the block and HANNA catches
the door and enters.</p>
<p>****: Excuse me. I’m looking for Joanna Zadek’s house. Can you help?
The KURDISH WOMAN wont look HANNA in the eye as she passes. She mutters
her response.</p>
<p>****: I don’t speak German. HANNA kicks at the door but knows it
won’t be answered so doesn’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>project - day</strong>: HANNA walks round to the back door of
the apartment and approaches the kitchen window. She peers through. On
first inspection the kitchen seems undisturbed. Then HANNA sees the
framed photograph of JOANNA on the wall. Blood splattered across the
glass.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: You won’t find anything. HANNA turns in
shock.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Marissa would have been much too careful for
that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Sit down Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are you my father?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are you my father?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Are you? Moment of electric silence between
them. ERIK does nothing but she knows the answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the
floor. Breathing fast.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s wrong with me? ERIK flinches
slightly.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: At Galinka.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It was a secret CIA research programme in
rural Poland.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What kind of research?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Children. HANNA stares at ERIK.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It was run by Marissa Wiegler. The science
came from the old East Germany. The money from the CIA. The intention
was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos…
to improve</p>
<p>****: Improve? ERIK looks at her. She looks so young, so numb, so
lost.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Reduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase
muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better
soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It’s her he’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How did you know about it? ERIK’s stares
right at her.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands
her a piece of paper from his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: This is what you were looking for. HANNA
reads. It is an invitation to Johanna Zadek to participate in the
Galinka project. A projected date of arrival at the Galinka Centre. A
date - 23rd February 1995. An agreed fee to be paid to Johanna. Five
hundred American dollars. An agreement to give up the child and have no
legal claim over it. The letter is signed by Erik Heller.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I recruited your mother at an abortion clinic
in May 1994. She was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Some boy
at a disco. HANNA looks at the paper in shock.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I had recruited twenty women. She was the
last. She was different. Two years later I heard the programme was to be
terminated. The research “disposed of”.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Disposed of?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I tried to save all of you. But you were the
only one I was able to rescue.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hanna listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Keep away from me. ERIK approaches her. With
real conviction.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: It worked. You worked.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You mean I’m a killer?</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: No… no.. He makes to touch her. HANNA springs
back in violent repulsion.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: We have a new identity for you. A new life. A
new beginning. She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops,
pushes her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Don’t. She attacks, ERIK pushes her to one
side, grabs her. A fight in the apartment. Chaos, photos of Johanna
crashing, lamps and bookshelves falling. HANNA murderous, ERIK just
defending himself, not willing to hurt her. But then she overpowers him,
has a knife to his throat.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Let me go. He releases her. She goes to the
door.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: I tried to prepare you for what your life
would be.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You didn’t prepare me for this. And her look
is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK knows he has done a terrible
wrong. She starts to leave down the fire escape. ERIK calls after
her.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Hanna wait. He looks out to watch her go. It’s
then ERIK sees the cars coming across the estate scrubland. ERIK turns
in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs through the destroyed
living room, and out through the front door.</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs
into full view of the cars, deliberately distracting them from
HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: That’s him. And the car swerves to follow
him. Thus moving unknowingly away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA
can see the cars in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted
them.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Drop it. MARISSA steps out of the doorway,
her gun trained on him. There are men at the end of the alleyway. No
escape. HELLER drops his gun. Silence between them. He turns to look her
in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: So go ahead. She stares at him. Wants to make
this as painful as she can for him.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You know I’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>erik</strong>: Don’t under estimate what you created.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What we created, together.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Truth is I was always very fond of you.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Leave him here. And they all walk away
leaving him alone in the East Berlin dirt.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: They had a fight.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: She must know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>isaacs</strong>: Where do you think she’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Where would you go? MARISSA turns to
ISAACS.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m closing the CIA operation down. Heller
is dead, that’s all that matters to them. This we do alone.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I am looking for a train to Galinka.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Galinka is a small village. No trains. You
must wait for bus in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Do you have a sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Kitchen is closed. The BUSINESSMAN speaks in
German.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Get her something. Poor girl’s hungry.
The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I’m from Leipzig. HANNA flinches at the
name. Leipzig.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The same.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Business? He looks at her body. HANNA
senses it. Her sandwich arrives. It’s grim. She leaves it, walks
out.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I am tired. I need to sleep. She leaves the
bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs. BUSINESSMAN follows.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Hello? She walks along the corridor,
gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN follows.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: I was just making nice conversation.
Yes? As she enters her room, he puts his foot in the door.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Let’s talk. Maybe we can do business.
HANNA kicks his foot out of the door. Hard.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: You don’t like talk, huh? He barges
into the room and grabs her. Tries to push her on to the bed. He is
strong. His words and tone contrasting violently with his actions.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Be nice. Be a nice little dolly. HANNA
is thrust on to the bed, but suddenly turns him over her head and
smashes him against a cupboard. BUSINESSMAN grabs her hair and throws
her on the bed. But now HANNA snaps. She starts to roar. It’s like an
animal, like nothing we have seen before. She rips at his face, grabs a
glass, smashes it and cuts his face with it. Pure animal rage.
BUSINESSMAN starts to scream, blood pouring from his eyes. He collapses
on the floor. She kicks him, punches him, repeatedly in a grief-fuelled
rage until she is spent of her primal fury and falls, panting, to the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I have this much. Can you take me to
Galinka?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: This is as far as the money gets you. HANNA
looks out. Middle of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How much further?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Twelve miles.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Please. But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA
gets out. Starts to walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it
came.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m going to Galinka. Can you help me? A
woman’s voice, German, in German.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes I can take you there. And as HANNA gets
in, she looks at the comforting, smiling face of MARISSA WIEGLER.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: It’s a very dull place Galinka. Why would
you want to go there?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I was born there. But I’ve never really seen
it. Why are you going?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I have some business to sort out. She looks
at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: It’s very lucky we ran into each other,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You’ve hurt your arm.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s okay. MARISSA hands her some tissue.
HANNA bandages the arm.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m Astrid.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You’re not German. Are you American?</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: That’s right. I lived there for many years.
I travel a lot. MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the
first time in ages. She feels the tears come.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Oh dear, what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: It’s okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods.
She fights the tears. MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA
weeping.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: What sort of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t know what to do. Nothing is what I
thought it would be. It’s… ugly and cruel and I don’t know where to go,
or… I’m stupid. I don’t know what I expected… MARISSA secretly,
genuinely affected by this. Fights the emotion that has surprised her.
Human warmth.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Sometimes I feel the same way.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I like music.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Sleep why don’t you? You look very tired.
It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift
off, so long since she has slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests
against the window. She is asleep. Vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where are we? MARISSA calms herself
instantly.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Nearly there. HANNA doesn’t see MARISSA’S
SHOES.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It’s so small.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old
bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Thank you for the ride. You’re very kind.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I wish there was more I could do for you.
MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the intimacy. MARISSA
reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands
to HANNA.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Here, take this. HANNA switches the torch
on and off, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I hope you find what you’re looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to
you… From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of CHILDREN,
the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake lit with birthday
candles. The children’s faces glow eerily in the candle light. They’re
looking at HANNA and walking straight towards her as they sing.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Happy Biirrrrthday, dear… The CHILDREN
arrive at HANNA lifting the cake towards her.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: … Hanna. Happy Birthday to you! HANNA
leans forward, takes a deep breath and blows. The children disappear
with the flames of the candles. The sound of a woman’s approaching
footsteps echo through the tunnel. HANNA swings her torch beam in the
direction of the footsteps. She freezes as she sees a pair of GREEN
SHOES walking towards her. The same shoes as in Wilhelm’s house.</p>
<p><strong>marissa wiegler.</strong>: HANNA raises her torch beam to see
the face of the woman from the car.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You’re Marissa Wiegler. HANNA starts to
shake. MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is the
same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence. HANNA
breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Don’t worry sweetie. I don’t want to hurt
you. MARISSA’S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of maternal
care. HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I could have killed you already when you
were asleep in the car. HANNA’S still shaking. HANNA now sees ISAACS and
his HENCHMEN, three of them, all with hunting rifles. All ready to shoot
her should she attack or run. They are some distance away, not coming
any closer.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Did Erik tell you about this place?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Where are the other children? She looks at
MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Sleeping. They’re all sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure you
walk out of here and keep walking. Grow up and grow old in safety and
security. No one need know a thing. But you have to trust me. You can’t
talk about this with anyone. It’s what we call “classified.” If you tell
anyone, it’ll be dangerous for both of us. HANNA looks at her,
remembering what ERIK told her, trying hard not to succumb.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You killed my mother.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: You’re mother didn’t want you, sweetie. I
saved you. HANNA just stares, not believing her.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I’m the only person left who understands
who you are. The only one who cares. MARISSA holds out a hand to HANNA,
for HANNA to take, a motherly gesture…</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: I practically am your mother.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No more. No more. Tears are streaming down
her face as she reaches sight of the tunnel mouth and the daylight
beyond. Standing in silhouette is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and
stops when she can see the white of MARISSA’S eyes and the finger on
MARISSA’S trigger. MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA
comes forward again, walking calmly towards her. She stops and drops her
gun to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Everything I see is nothing I want. MARISSA
looks at HANNA, her gentle, childlike countenance. She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Let me take care of you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. I don’t want that. HANNA turns her back
on MARISSA and starts to walks in the opposite direction. MARISSA
watches her walk away. HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.</p>
<p><strong>marissa</strong>: Hanna. HANNA spins, fires directly at
CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>fade up:</strong>: The sun spreads its golden fingers through
the trees catching the early morning dew.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The Earth is the third planet from the Sun,
and the fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar System. HANNA
sits down on a tree trunk outside the cabin and pours some milk into the
bowl, then drinks a little for herself.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Home to millions of species, including
humans, Earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to
exist. She raises her head and makes a small clicking sound. Her friend,
the snow fox, appears from the trees. The fox now has a small family of
cubs. HANNA watches as the cubs approach the milk and begin to
drink.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The planet formed over four and a half
billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion
years. HANNA sits back and feels the sunlight on her face. Above her the
trees are beginning to leaf.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It is expected to continue supporting life
for another one and a half billion years, after which the rising
luminosity of the Sun will eliminate it all. HANNA surveys her beautiful
world.</p>
