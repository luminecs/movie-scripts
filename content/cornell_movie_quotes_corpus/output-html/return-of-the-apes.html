<h1 id="return-of-the-apes">return-of-the-apes</h1>
<p><strong>return of the apes</strong>: by Terry Hayes</p>
<p><strong>deep space.</strong>: No atmosphere, no life, nothing. Just a
web of lights- a billion stars hang in a velvet void. The only sound is
the howl of the cosmic wind.</p>
<p><strong>a pueblo village.</strong>: A broken-down pick-up bumps into
a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe houses, blinding flurries of
dust and sand. The pick-up stops in front of a crumbling church. A man
in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag. This is the DOCTOR. ’</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s face.</strong>: Screaming. She’s very young - a
South American Indian - lying on a bed in a corner of one of the houses.
She is in the final throes of childbirth, a sheet draped over her loins.
The Doctor works between her legs, encouraging her in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>down her chin. the breath explodes from her lungs as she
pushes really hard</strong>: -</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Arriva!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Dead - the child is dead. Now go!</p>
<p><strong>a helicopter</strong>: Off the roof of a tall hospital
building. As it rises up into the night we see a red cross painted on
its side. It’s an air ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>grove of trees</strong>: Winter’s coming on - every leaf is a
different shade of amber and gold. The helicopter drops down between the
branches and lands on an immaculately tended lawn. Surrounding it are
the gracious buildings of a great university. Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>a pair of mechanical hands</strong>: slide a long cylindrical
“key” into the stainless steel casket. We pull back to reveal the casket
lies in a sealed, uncontaminated room. A group of people in lab coats
-scientists and researchers - stare through the glass walls.</p>
<p><strong>blood sprays</strong>: But not from the baby’s chest - it’s
in glass vials, exploding as white-hot flames consume them. A
plastic-gloved lab assistant, silhouetted against the flames, is
emptying hospital waste into a furnace. He slams the door shut.</p>
<p><strong>robinson.</strong>: He takes a steel trolley, wheels it
through a set of swing doors and out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>closed circuit tv screen</strong>: features the image of one
of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy. She’s in her 30s -
attractive, long hair left loose on her shoulders, an air of authority
about her. Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND. She is a Professor of
Biology.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: The exact cause of death is still unknown.
What is certain - we’re dealing with something we’ve never seen before.
Every organ in the body is affected…</p>
<p><strong>an auditorium</strong>: Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium
continuing her briefing. About forty scientists are sitting in front of
her in a dimly-lit lecture hall.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: The baby in question, Michael James
Flanagan -she points at the computer-generated graphic on a huge
screen</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: But the Center for Disease Control in
Atlanta has received similar reports from a village in Bolivia, two
cities in Australia, seven countries in Europe, a cluster of cases in
Namibia and Mexico. Forty-two cases in all.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Like Michael Flanagan, they were full-term
babies. Two hundred and seventy eight days since conception and yet, by
all reasonable medical standards, they have completed their entire life
cycle. They have gone from conception to death, not in three score years
and ten, but in slightly less than nine months. Michael Flanagan died of
old age.</p>
<p><strong>sheets of ice on a shutter door</strong>: Will crouches in
front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town. It’s night,
the place is deserted. He slips a rusted key into a padlock. Snapl The
key breaks.</p>
<p><strong>spiders</strong>: weave a web in a corner of the storage
unit. A work light hangs from the ceiling. Will is ripping open stacks
of boxes from long ago. He puts together a pile of yellowing files and
old floppy disks.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I would like to thank the faculty and staff
for this great honor…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: have had the opportunity to work with three
talented colleagues. I’m privileged to also call them my friends -</p>
<p><strong>lafayette park</strong>: Night. Homeless people in the park
build cardboard shelters against a coming storm. Across the road, the
first drops of rain splatter against the White House.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: There’s no mistake - you’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>jefferson library</strong>: Diamond sits in the President’s
study - book-lined walls, a fire in the hearth. A group of men sit on
the sofasthe Surgeon-General, the Chief of Staff, the National Security
Advisor, the Secretaw of Health. A table is littered with graphs end
files.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We’ve got five thousand cases now, Mr
President. That’s in three weeks. The number is doubling every hundred
and sixty-eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: That’s a geometric progression, sir. In
three months there’Il be over seven million cases. After that we hit the
wall -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: According to this, there won’t be a live
birth on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: These are just computer projections -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Tell that to the dinosaurs, sir.</p>
<p><strong>national security advisor</strong>: What date - when exactly
do we hit this wall?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Six months and twenty-one days.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Can’t somebody tell me - what exactly are
we dealing with. Is it a virus or what?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Whatever they need, Bob - anything. Harry
Truman put together the Manhattan Project - you understand?</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: A world without children -it’s
inconceivable. And what about the rest of us - what do we do? Just sit
and watch our species die? Will the last person to leave the planet turn
out the lights.</p>
<p><strong>press secretary</strong>: We’re going to have to manage the
public. Right now, the truth may be inoperative -</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Of course we’re going to have to manage
itl We’re going to have to manage a whole lot of things. But can’t we
take at least one moment to be human?</p>
<p><strong>a cheap apartment</strong>: Through the window - the neon
sign of a gas station. This is Will’s place, He lives alone - a bed in
the corner, run-down furniture, dishes in the sink.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jesus Christ… of course!</p>
<p><strong>a luxurious bathroom</strong>: Through frosted glass we see
the silhouette of a woman taking a shower. Whoever she is, she’s got a
great figure. The sound of a doorbell. The shower door opens -Diamond
sticks her head out. She looks at a clock - it’s almost midnight.</p>
<p><strong>video entry phone</strong>: A video screen monitors the front
door. On it we see Will - his hair tousled, an old overcoat buttoned to
the neck, a battered briefcase under his arm.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I think you have the wrong house.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I work at the department.</p>
<p><strong>an elegant room</strong>: Will and Diamond sit in the living
room of a gracious townhouse - wooden floors and beautiful rugs. Diamond
doesn’t wear any make-up -just jeans and an oversized shirt. She looks
even more beautiful. It does nothing to ease Will’s nerves. He’s got his
briefcase open in front of him, speaking from sheaves of notes and
papers.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Hold on - how do you know about the case
load? The Government’s trying to manage this - they’ve withheld that
information.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The Internet, Doctor. It’s a highway - you can
ride it anywhere you want. I got into ’the Center for Disease Control. I
had a look at their raw data.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Jesus. Do you know what you’re doing? This
is the White House we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, it’s a disease and it doesn’t come any
worse than this - that’s what we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve listened at the lab - I think I know
where you’re looking. Bacterias mostly, but there’s a strong push into
the retro-viruses. You’re wrong, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Really - and I thought I was arrogant. But
then, I’m just a professor.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on
the grounds of sex.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I can think of one.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sure, it can start in pockets but it never
stays there. This thing does. It only affects women of child-bearing
age. What - it’s so smart it can recognize motherhood? I don’t think so.
No, this is into the very heart of what we are. This is genetic. This is
part of the DNA.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Thank you. A hundred thousand genes make up
human DNA - that really narrows it down.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: As a matter of fact it does. There’s only one
part of the DNA that’s passed exclusively through women. Thirty-seven
genes, the oldest part of the human organism -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: The mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Over the years there’s been speculation -not
all of it crazy either - that somehow it triggers aging, He slides a
sheaf of yellowing extracts from scientific journals across the table.
She doesn’t pay them any attention - she’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You realize what you’re saying, don’t you?
A bacteria - I think we’d get it for sure. A virus -you’d have to say
we’ve got a chance. But say you’re right. The mitochondrial DNA - that’s
so far out on the frontier, we can barely see it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Like I said - it doesn’t get any worse than
this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Shit. You’re pregnant, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Nine weeks.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Do you want a drink - coffee, a sandwich or
something?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No…no, I’m fine thanks.</p>
<p><strong>an empty street</strong>: It’s late at night. Will clutches
his briefcase under his arm, heading home. A bitter wind blows out of
the north. He looks a lonely and forlorn figure as he makes his way
through the pools of light cast by the streetlights.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: It’s just an idea, Bob. All we’re doing is
taking it for a walk around the block.</p>
<p><strong>de maupassant</strong>: There was a lot of work done on it in
the 7Os. I can’t recall the details but someone had the idea that
mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory. If you could unlock it, you
could physically travel back down it. Through evolution - like a time
machine.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Wowl Those 70s, man. I’m really sorry I missed
them.</p>
<p><strong>old photos of a sailing boat</strong>: They hang on the wall
of a tiny room - not an office, just a hole-in-the-wall Will has turned
into his own. He sits at a table, making notes. A knock - Diamond
enters.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I thought you’d like to know - we’re
looking at mitochondrial DNA,</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks for telling me.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Seattle. Is that where you went to
school?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Princeton.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Expensive.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A scholarship. Then I did some post-graduate
work… I never really finished.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s a Kestrel 24 - I haven’t seen one of
those in years. She’s a beautiful boati</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: My grandfather left it to me. I don’t sail
it much any more - it’s too hard to find a for’etd hand.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about your husband - doesn’t he sail.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I don’t know - I haven’t met him yet.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I wanted a baby but I’m thirty-four-years
old. Sooner or later you realize that somewhere along the way you’ve
missed the man you’ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What did you do - ask a friend?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I thought of it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Lucky friend.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I went to a clinic. Not exactly romantic,
but it worked. Good idea, bad timing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How many people have you put on the mDNA?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s all?!</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: That’s all I can spare. It’s just a theory
-one of dozens of theories.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What is it with you - it’s not just science
is it? Why are you so passionate about this?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I know I’m right. It’s a mutation. A hundred
thousand years it’s probably been lying there -shifting, weaving into
the mDNA. You either go back and change evolution or you engineer it
out. Seven peopleYou might as well shoot peas at a dam.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You haven’t answered my question - why so
passionate?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The question’s not relevant. The only thing
I’m interested in is the science.</p>
<p><strong>a geodesic dome</strong>: White, space-age, is being erected
on the lawn. Workmen are unloading the NASA trucks. We pull back through
a high window of the Biology building. A woman stands there, looking
out. Her name is KRIS McQUADE. This is her office -</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: You want to tell me what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Don’t ask, Kris, I’d have to lie and I
don’t want to do that to my best friend,</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: The rumor is, you’ve done something really
big. They say the Defense Department is taking it over.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: Okay, okay - I’m sorry I asked. So what
about this guy - what’s he done?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: He hasn’t done anything - I’m just
interested.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: Ten thousand employment records I’ve got on
file and you want to know about a lab assisant?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: The smartest assistant I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: What - he can mop and fart at the same
time?</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: He’s handsome, at least I’ll say - Jesus -
you’re not interested in him like that, are you?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: No, but he’s the most unbelievable smelling
man.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: Smelling? You’re pregnant - obviously your
hormones have gone crazy. What exactly does he smell like?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You know… .., wholesome.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: Of course he does - that’s the Lysol.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: That’s strange - there’s supposed to be a
background sheet. Family, school -all that shit. It must have gotten
lost.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Your secretary’s on the line, Dr Diamond.
There’s a call for you.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Tell her to take a message.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: It’s the New York Times.</p>
<p><strong>mcquade</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I think Washington’s news management just
went south.</p>
<p><strong>the white house</strong>: Night. Scores of television news
vans are parked outsideDutch, Japanese and French reporters are doing
stand-ups live-to-air. We hear Peter Jennings of</p>
<p><strong>jennings</strong>: We’re standing by to go live to Washington
as events continue to unfold on this remarkable day. I don’t think
there’s a person anywhere who’s not sitting by a radio or television
now. I’m told the President is on his way to the press room -</p>
<p><strong>fifth avenue</strong>: is totally empty - just a young man on
rollerblades. He skates effortlessly down the deserted avenue - past
Tiffany’s and the Trump Tower, all silent now.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: My fellow Americans…</p>
<p><strong>steel door opens</strong>: A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy
clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a vaulted basement. All we can
see are silhouettestowers of crates, racks of equipment…</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: This used to be the basement of the
Psychology Department. We just sort of stacked everything around ’em
-</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Flotation tanks. They used ’em for
experiments in sensory degradation -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Deprivation - sensory deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Yeah, well - whatever.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Now I know what a mole feels like -</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: It feels like a fucking coffin, that’s
what it feels like.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Hey, fella - what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just looking. I’ll be coming back - I’ll need
a key.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: One other thing - don’t tell anyone, huh?</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Who would I tell? They treat me like shit
Worse than shit. All work, no appreciation. The phantom of Harvard.
Someone should write a fucking musical about me.</p>
<p><strong>circles of light</strong>: Desk lamps, glowing in an office.
Diamond and a team of researchers are working through piles of old
journals and extracts from scientific papers.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Here’s another one - “Mitochondrial DNAA
Map to the Past.”</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Who’s it by?</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Jesus, what did this guy do - write the
book on it? Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>huge book being opened</strong>: It’s a scientific directory.
The researcher flicks the pages and stops at “Plant”.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Wow - I thought your career was
impressive.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Degrees in medicine and microbiology. A
PhD at 24, a member of the Academy of Sciences, published twenty times
by 1974…</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Then nothing.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Where did he go as an undergraduate?</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Princeton.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: On a scholarship?</p>
<p><strong>a corridor</strong>: It’s late at night. The scientists and
their staff are working around the clock. Will wheels a trolley laden
with bottles, vials, and catheters down a crowded corridor. Diamond
pushes through the people behind, trying to catch up to him. Scientists
turn to speak to her but she ignores them.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Robert!</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Doctor Plant!</p>
<p><strong>diamond’s office</strong>: She sits behind her desk,
listening to the chief of campus security.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: The equipment you saw him with was
taken from three labs. It includes a range of genetic material- We’ve
checked all the buildings your team is using - he’s not in any of
them.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What about hie house?</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: He asked his landlady to look
after his cat. She hasn’t seen him for three days.</p>
<p><strong>in the basement</strong>: there’s a make-shift bed and a
hot-plate with a battered saucepan. Next to it is a rack of medical
equipment and laboratory vials.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You wanna tell me what exactly you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Looking for a date.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: What’s wrong with a calendar?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: These are chemical sequences - they represent
human genes. By following a trail of mutations, I can date them. I’m
trying to find out when a major change occurred in something called the
mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: The mitochondrial DNA? Yeah… well that
makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You’ve found it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah - I’ve found it.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: So - what’s the date?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The best computer science can do? One hundred
and two thousand years ago.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Sort of what I figured - give or take a
day or two.</p>
<p><strong>diamond’s office</strong>: Diamond is poring through
scientific articles written by Will. She flicks a page -there’s a photo
of Will, 20 years younger, surrounded by three colleagues. He’s got his
arm around one of them - an attractive young woman.</p>
<p><strong>we are flying</strong>: swooping and soaring - through a
weird landscape of towering cliffs, tumbling streams and primordial
forest. There’s something unreal about it - we pull back to reveal
they’re computer-generated images, playing on the screens in the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is someone’s version of the prehistoric
world. I’m interested in the geography, the atmosphere -that sort of
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Africa - that’s where Mankind started.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: I’ll see you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thank you - for helping me, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: It sounds like you’re leaving or
something.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. I just wanted to say it, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: What exactly are you doing? You’re a bit
old to try and make your mark, aren’t you? Anyway, nobody listens to
people like us.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a
second chance. Do you know what it’s like to be ridiculed, to have your
ideas thrown back in your face? And that was the easy part. I guess
that’s what I’m doing - I want to prove that I was right.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You’re lying to me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do you mean?!</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: You are going somewhere. I don’t know
where it is. I’m not even sure I can imagine it. Good luck, though. I
hope you find whatever it is you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: No point in getting you breakfast,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>diamond’s office</strong>: Diamond looks up from the papers
and articles littering her desk. Her Secretary stands in the doorway
-</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’ve got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone.
She runs the archives at Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Ms Wilkins?</p>
<p><strong>outer office</strong>: The security officer and several of
his men are looking at maps of the campus. Researchers and scientists
have gathered in the office, rumors are flying. Everyone turns - Diamond
stands in the doorway to her office. She looks at deMaupassant.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You were right, Luc. That work you
remembered from Berkeley - he was the one that did it. He said man was
the last step on an evolutionary trail. Within every one of us is the
history of our race. It’s imprinted on our genes - like a map. Anyone
that can find the chemical key can travel back down it. Through the
womb. Through time and space - That’s what he’s doing. He’s going back.
He’s going to try and change evolution.</p>
<p><strong>security officer</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: He was the best of his generation. He
thinks so. He’s got the genetic material for the key. All he needs are
flotation tanks.</p>
<p><strong>the flotation tanks</strong>: The valves are open - warm
water is pouring into the tanks.</p>
<p><strong>a long corridor</strong>: Diamond and the others run fast
through pools of light cast by naked bulbs. Ahead -a pair of swing doors
-</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A theory’s one thing - do you really think
he’ll try it?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: He’s spent fifteen years as a lab
assistant. He lives in a two room walk-up with a cat. No family, no
friends. What’s There’s left for him here? Of course he’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>an iron ladder</strong>: Will climbs up the side of the
flotation tank. Suddenly he stops - a tremor, a rippling wave, passes
from his feet to his head. It’s his muscles contracting. It wracks him
with pain. He gasps at the intensity of it.</p>
<p><strong>darkness in the tank</strong>: Will floats on his back, the
only sound is the rapid thump of his heartbeat. The water sloshes back
and forth - his muscles are going into spasms. We push along his body -
up to his face. His eyes roll back into his headl</p>
<p><strong>will’s pov</strong>: red mist swirls in front of him. It
resolves itself into a web of interwoven tendrils -the double helix of
the DNA molecule. Will starts to travel through it -</p>
<p><strong>inside the tank</strong>: Will is morphing, shedding cells -
we’re losing him in the warm, dark fluid of the tank. It’s like the
womb. His body seems to be disintegrating, dissolving into it. Water
flows through the sockets where his eyes once were.</p>
<p><strong>outside the tank</strong>: Not a sound escapes. The security
officer is about to try and open the hatch.</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: The security officer turns - Diamond is holding
the catheter in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: If we open the hatch, I think we’ll kill
him. It’s too late - it’s his journey, he’s going to have to take
it.</p>
<p><strong>inside the tank</strong>: Will’s body is like a shadow,
almost one with the water, growing less distinct by the moment. What is
left of his face - a strange, shifting shape - floats towards us.
Closer… closer. It melts completely into the water -</p>
<p><strong>will’s pov</strong>: He spirals down a tunnel - into a
whirlpool of white light. As he hits, it shatters into a million
fragments of light. It looks like a comet, wheeling through the heavens.
A cosmic wind blows it forward. Will is traveling through space and time
-</p>
<p><strong>outside the tank</strong>: Diamond and the others are
gathered around the computers. Bob is working the keyboard. Diamond is
looking.through the piles of papers, notes and star charts.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Everything’s here - he kept a record of
every step. He can even tell the date -forty hours after he arrives
there’s a solar eclipse.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Billie - there’s a note for you.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: “I won’t be here, but if I solve this thing
make sure you tell them, Billie. Tell them it was Robert Plant, Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.”</p>
<p><strong>the fragments of light</strong>: blaze through the heavens.
They draw together, changing and reconstituting into a shape we
recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules. The strands
connect. A blast of light! It’s the rays of -</p>
<p><strong>the sun</strong>: streaming into a cave. Will lies in the
fetal position, bleeding from his nose and ears. The light grows
stronger - it’s dawn. Will drags himself up and stumbles towards the
entrance. We tilt up from him. He doesn’t see it, but we do -
prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock.</p>
<p><strong>a craggy peak</strong>: Will steps out of the cave. Sunrise
sweeps over a world born brand new - plains and jungle and primordial
forest. Rising above it is a snow-capped mountain that looks like
Kilamlnjlro. A ragged gash runs across the earth - a rift valley. Will
stares at it. He raises his face to the sun. He did it. The first step’s
over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the valley is a tiny
pillar of smoke.</p>
<p><strong>a forest clearing</strong>: In the middle are the smoldering
remains of a camp-fire. Will moves cautiously towards it. He stops -
several bodies, terribly mangled, lie on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>crushed leaves and broken plants</strong>: Will is following
a tiny trail through the forest. He’s taken what is useful from the
bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag, two short-handled
spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt. He moves on - deeper
into the shadows of the forest.</p>
<p><strong>a sparkling stream</strong>: Will splashes through the
crystal water. He looks upstream - a small lake. A flock of strange
birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of pink and gold.</p>
<p><strong>plume of water</strong>: cascades a hundred feet into a
hidden gorge. Smoke curls up from fires. Scores of stone-age people -
man, women and children - turn and look. Will, roped and bound, is being
hauled into the encampment.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t have a tribe.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: No man can live without a tribe! How would he
hunt the mighty animals? Who would keep his fire burning?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I come from far away… I’m a traveler.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: What is traveler? Is that a tribe?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You carry things taken from our hunters! Kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: Whackl A blow to the back of Will’s neck knocks
him to his knees. He looks up -two warriors have their spears raised,
about to plunge them into his chest.</p>
<p><strong>the cave entrance</strong>: Kip and his warriors have seen
them too. They scramble into the cave. Men and women are inside,
swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from tree trunks.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cave</strong>: Slam! The doors fly shut. Wham! A
huge cross-beam drops into place. Will, sprawled in the dust, looks up -
chaos. By torchlight, the medicine man is tending the wounded, children
are screaming, women and old people are clambering up a series of
ledges. High above is a tiny slash of daylightanother entrance.</p>
<p><strong>outside the doors</strong>: The three machines are in place.
The first of them has two huge stone balls suspended by chains from an
overhead jib. An ape sits right on top, operating it. The balls dance
and swing wildly - smash! They hit the door, opening a hole.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cave</strong>: Daylight streams in. Kip and his
warriors have ranged themselves high around the walls, ready to attack
when the apes pour in. A pair of huge iron jaws appear in the hole. This
is the second of the apes’ machines - the Claw.</p>
<p><strong>an old warrior</strong>: is perched high on a series of
wooden bars that seal off a corner of the cave, turning it into a cage.
He opens it.</p>
<p><strong>outside the cave</strong>: Drak fights to control his mount
as the tiger lands once and bounds into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>on the ledges</strong>: Kip’s men are fighting as they
retreat, heading towards the opening at the roof of the cave. Will,
clutching his wounded shoulder, makes his own way up the wall.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>outside the cave</strong>: Will’s horse bursts out of the
cave - past the Claw and under the Balls. The apes turn and look -
astonished. They scramble for their horses. Drak charges through.</p>
<p><strong>the dappled light of the forest</strong>: Drak rises up in
the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge ape stands on
the back of the charging horse!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: So - it’s human, after ell.</p>
<p><strong>the world upside down</strong>: It’s Will’s point of view -
he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart. He’s very weak, his shirt
drenched in blood. He rolls over and the image rights itself.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where the fuck am I?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: The end of the road.</p>
<p><strong>massive iron and wood bridge</strong>: spans a roaring river.
Drak and his convoy clatter across it. We crane up - laid out before is
a city. Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged ravine. Opening on
to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of stone.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A city… of course. Ape city! I’ve destroyed my
mind. Or maybe I’m dead and this is God’s last joke - hell is ruled by
apes.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Quiet, animal!</p>
<p><strong>ripples of water</strong>: run across the surface of a
beautiful pool. A black shape glides along underwater. The head breaks
the surface - it’s an old gorilla, the fur on his face gray and balding.
This is NAZGUL. He is the Ghan - the President - of the Council of
Elders.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: The raiders are home.</p>
<p><strong>old ape</strong>: Good hunting?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: By the look of it.</p>
<p><strong>gray beard</strong>: Not as good as when we rode the high
ridges, I’ll warrant.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Times are different now. Back then, a could
go out and come back with a brace of animals. They’re far scarcer now
-</p>
<p><strong>old ape</strong>: Not scarce enough, I say.</p>
<p><strong>a tiny boat</strong>: is wreathed in woven leaves. Lying in
it is the dead body of a young ape. The boat drifts down an underground
stream. All around it rise the stone walls of a huge cavern. Torches
light up the gloom - this place is a temple.</p>
<p><strong>a rock platform</strong>: The mourners step through the arch
and on to a slab of rock. We pull back to reveal where they stand - a
huge crouching ape has been carved out of the face of a cliff, Its bowed
front legs form the archway, the entrance to the temple of the ape.</p>
<p><strong>ma -gog</strong>: In the beginning was the word, and the word
was the Book of the Lore. It says God created the ape in His own image.
Alone among His creatures, the ape has a soul. One crosses the river now
but death is only a door. He will dwell in the house of the Lord
forever. Amen The mourners beat their chests with their fists. They
repeat the word “Amen”.</p>
<p><strong>apes hang from the ‘ladders’</strong>: looking down on Drak
and his troops. The convoy passes along a road cut into the side of the
ridge. Apes have come out of the houses and buildings to greet them.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Some… sort of human.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: But look at the eyes, ’Pa - they’re the color
of the sea. Where’s it from?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I don’t know - a traveler, maybe.
Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower of the Moon.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No it’s not - it’s a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>laborer</strong>: Put it in the zoo!</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: Whatever it is, it’s male.</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: Probe.</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: Drak!</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: The animal’s bleeding to death, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: I didn’t bring him all this way just to have
him die.</p>
<p><strong>zora</strong>: Ben-Guri - get a vet. Quicklyl</p>
<p><strong>an ape in a leather apron</strong>: uses a grinding wheel to
sharpen a gruesome looking knife. This is the VET. Will lies on a stone
slab nearby - it’s a sort of medical centersinks along the walls, racks
of equipment, hoses to wash down the blood.</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: We’re going to have to give him blood.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner in a cell</strong>: He’s a tribesman - in his late
40s. Despite his tattered furs and hollow cheeks, he carries himself
with dignity - he’s a proud man. His name is ARAGORN. On a chain around
his neck he wears a metal ornament, like crescent moon. Etched into it
are strange markings and the totems of various tribes.</p>
<p><strong>team of horses</strong>: - their flanks drenched in sweat -
walk in a circle. They turn a huge wheel that controls a series of
pulleys and winches. Attached to the end of a heavy cable is a wooden
platform - a primitive elevator. It runs from a series of impressive
house, down the side of the ravine, to the center of the city.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn lies on his back</strong>: He’s strapped to a slab,
half-naked, in the medical center. They’ve put a gag in his mouth and
though he struggles to free himself, he can barely move.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: It’s human, you say?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: It’s even uglier than the others.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: How can he hunt with legs like those
-they’re like twigs. Maybe he’s diseased.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Help me. I’ve got health insurance.
Honest…</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: What is health insurance?</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: Some sort of religion…?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Do you think this’Il work?</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: You can never tell with animals. Their bodies
aren’t as sophisticated as an ape’s. Sometimes their blood fights with
each other. Either way, you know really quick -they get up and walk
around, or they’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>words chiseled into stone</strong>: “An Ape without knowledge
is a fire without light.”</p>
<p><strong>the bladder of blood</strong>: is empty. Guards are collaring
Aragorn, preparing to drag him out. The door into the room is thrown
open. Ma-Gog enters. Nazgul and the others greet him but he barely
acknowledges it</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: Show him to me.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: All my life I’ve dreaded this day. Kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: We’ve just spent an hour trying to save
him -</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: The animal’s unique, my lord. At least
we should look at his brain. Maybe it’s possible to remove the frontal
lobes without killing him. Imagine - a tame human!</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: Man can’t be tamed. Alone among God’s
primates he kills for lust or greed. He will murder his own brother to
possess his brother’s land.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: The doctor’s only asking for a chance to
experiment. The benefits would be enormous. A tame species of human
could double food production, at last we could dam the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: You don’t know what you’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: It’s just an animal, Ma-Gog.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: It’s not. That’s the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>heavy iron door</strong>: set in a rock wall - on one side a
key-hole. We tilt up the door to a narrow set of bars high above it. A
face, straining with effort, rises up to peer through the bars. It is
Will - looking like death but forcing himself to do it, desperate to see
where he is.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cell</strong>: The muscles across his shoulders
ripple. His one good hand clutches the bars. He hangs by it, supporting
his weight, staring out at a vaulted underground cavern. It looks like a
cattle-yard, broken down and disused nowa series of long pens, wooden
chutes and a primitive conveyor belt.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: So you lived, then?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What did they do?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They gave you blood.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I hope you had a medical.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It was a slaughterhouse.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For horses?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They use it for stables now. No - s
different kind of animal. For humans.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: In my father’s time, the apes rounded up
tribes and brought them here. Young apes killed some during their
manhood rites, the others were made sport of in the corrals. At the end,
the bodies were thrown onto the belts and fed to the fire.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Death is stuck to these walls, stranger
-sounds not even s thousand winters can take away. Sometimes of s night
they speak to me - I can hear the screams of my people.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Why haven’t they killed you?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They keep me ss bait. My name is Aragorn
-</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I am the Ranger of the Easterlings, the
Leader of the Seven Tribes. They hope the warriors will come and try to
free me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And will they?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Not if they fear my anger. I was taken in
summer and now winter’s almost gone. Even the apes grow tired - soon
they’ll make me walk the Paths of the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: what is it?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It’s called the Crescent of Light - it’s
the talisman of my rank.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Silver.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Mithral is how we name it..</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can I borrow it?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Who are you? What brings you to the valley
of the tribes?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I meant you no harm. I’m looking for woman,
one of my own kind. Do you know of people like me?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: If you want to get out of hare. I need the
talisman. Aragorn.</p>
<p><strong>the temple of the ape</strong>: Torches burn on the walls.
They cast a glow across the temple - the underground stream, pools of
water, shelves of rock hewn out of the walls. Several apes crouch on
them, praying to a golden idol of an ape.</p>
<p><strong>the temple’s inner chamber</strong>: Oil lamps - hidden in
alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog. He stands in front of an ancient book -
strange symbols, like Sanskrit, run across its pages. This is the Book
of the Lore.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: How many scrolls are there in the Book of
the Lore?</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: One-hundred-and-seventy-six, you say -every
child knows that. But every child is wrong. There is one more scroll -
the last scroll, sealed with seven seals, handed down from high priest
to high priest…</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: It is called the Scroll of Revelation.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: “And it was given unto me to know the wisdom
of ages. A silence fell and I saw a new heaven and a new earth. Like
through a glass, darkly, I saw the future.”</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: “Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale
horse and the name of the horse is Death. Those that ride on him are
beasts, but like no beasts born before. Their limbs are weak but their
eyes are as cold as the sea. They are given power over the earth to kill
with the sword and with famine and with fire. And let him that hath
understanding know the number of these beasts. It is the number of
Man.”</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: Today we saw that beast. Mark those words,
my Lords - “their limbs are weak but they are given power over the
earth”. Now will you listen? Kill him! And if we don’t? Then all hope
will fail in this bitter winter.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Kill him. Kill him with the sword and with
fire. Kill himl</p>
<p><strong>the keyhole to the cell</strong>: It’s a shining bright
image, slightly distorted. We pull back to reveal it’s a reflection.
Aragorn’s silver ornament has been polished to a brilliant luster. It’s
fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking through the bars high
above the iron door.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cell</strong>: The wooden bed has been smashed to
pieces.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you understand time.., what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Seven hours since the rising of the
sun.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Just after noon…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Shouldn’t we wait until night?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: If I’m right, it’s gonna be dark a lot sooner
than you think.</p>
<p><strong>the sun</strong>: beats down from a cloudleu sky. Drak and
two huge Praetorian Guards - Max and Hannibal - come through a huge
stone portico. It’s another entrance to the Temple -one that opertl onto
a central square. Orak and the two guards hurry across it. towards the
slaughterhouu.</p>
<p><strong>the nail</strong>: at the end of the pole slides into the
keyhole. Will - barely breathing in case it breaks his concentration -
listens carefully. He moves the end of the pole. The nail turns.</p>
<p><strong>huge set of doors</strong>: are thrown open. Daylight spills
into the slaughterhouse. Drak, Max and Hannibal enter. Drak stops - he
listens to the horses whinnying and stomping their hooves -</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Something’s wrong! Get the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: moves cautiously along the side one of the
corrals, trying to see what’s wrong with the horses. Behind him - a
movement in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Watch - they’re going to bring in the
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>the dogs</strong>: aren’t really dogs at all - they’re a much
earlier ancestor. We call them wolves. There are two of them, on the end
of heavy leather leashes. Their handlers have them in Will’s cell,
rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses in front of their noses. The
wolves take the scent.</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: rises groggily to his feet, clutching his
injured throat. He takes a few steps forward -Grrrr! He turns - the two
wolves fly towards him. He tries to yell but the only sound he can make
is a squeak.</p>
<p><strong>a stone passage-way</strong>: Will and Aragorn are running,
plunging down in to darkness. Arches and corridors open off of it. It’s
like a labyrinth -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This doesn’t seem like the way out.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We’re not going out - not yet.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So what are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We’re going killing.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Killing?! Don’t be stupid -</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You do what you like! But I’m the Ranger of
the Easterlings -I won’t leave here until it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>row of cage-like cells</strong>: Will and Aragorn glide past
them. They’re taking it slowly, very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>crevice in the rock</strong>: We hold on the narrow opening,
looking deep into the shadows. A big ape, heavily armed, stands there.
He has his back to us, his legs spread. A trickle of water runs down the
rock and drains away - he’s taking a piss. A shadow flickers on the wall
above him. He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore shadows -Will and Aragorn are
move through the torchlight. The steel doors are straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Two rules in life - never play cards with
anyone called Doc and never, whatever else you do, turn your back on an
ape.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thanks. I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Looking for the keys.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He saved our lives.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: He’s an ape!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You go and kill as many apes as you like - I’m
setting this one free.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It’s not apes I’m going to kill.</p>
<p><strong>a prison laboratory</strong>: The heavy steel doors stand
open. Inside is a clean and gruesome room - sinks and instruments along
a wall, a series of operating tables and a row of cages.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Leave it. He knows what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: The doctors operate on them - up here. The
tribes think that we steal their souls… Maybe they’re right.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: It’s done. We can go now.</p>
<p><strong>the wolves</strong>: There’s five of them now, hunting
through the slaughter-house in a pack. All around them we see the
torches of the apes as they search the nooks and crannies. The horses
whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: The fresher the better. Cover everything
-that’s the only way you’ll hide your scent.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Come on! Now!</p>
<p><strong>an unearthly light</strong>: has fallen on the city. The apes
are in confusion - soldiers and workers are running, children are
screaming. A horse has thrown its rider and is bolting down the
terraces.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: steps out on to a rock ledge. He holds a
staff in one hand, his cloak thrown back over his shoulder, magnificent
in the eerie light. He stares down at the chaos. Drak swings across a
ladder and lands at his side -</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: A sign - the hand of Man passes across the
face of God! Lookl He points to a terrace below - Will leads the other
two escapees along a road and on to the iron bridge. Drak and Ma-Gog
stare at them. Darkness engulfs them.</p>
<p><strong>christ on the cross</strong>: It’s a stained-glass window in
a huge cathedral. A priest is at the altar conducting Mass for the
repose of the dead. We pull back to reveal a tiny white coffin - just
big enough for a baby. Next to it is another coffin. And another - a row
of them.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: And even now as sorrow has no end, we find
comfort in the words of the Lord Jesus Christ. Did he not say unto Mark
-“suffer the little children to come unto me, for they are the Kingdom
of Heaven. Now and forever.” Amen.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>the space dome</strong>: is lit up by banks of lights that
turn night into day. The clock tower above the biology building shows
the time2.00am. Even so, the area bustles with activity.</p>
<p><strong>inside the dome</strong>: An illuminated chart dominates one
wall - just like the strategy map in the Pentagon’s war room. Every
research center is identified - next to it is its function and a list of
personnel. We see Princeton, Stanford, Texas A&amp;M, Los Alamos.
Tentacles reach out to Oxford, the Pasteur Institute, the University of
Beijing…</p>
<p><strong>a small office</strong>: Glass doors seal out the electronic
hum. Diamond, staring through the glass, looks exhausted. DeMaupassent
sits on a couch. He’s in his shirt-sleeves, dark rings under his eyes.
Next to him is Bob, the young neurologist. He wears jeans and a t-shirt.
On the front it says</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I’m sorry Luc - say that again.</p>
<p><strong>demaupassant</strong>: My fault, Billie - I rattle on too
much. The result is - we’ve fixed the time frame.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: There’s a trigger - some major fucking switch
gets turned. That’s what I’ve been working on. It’s definitely in the
mDNA. There’s a fragment of one chromosome I’m looking at -</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s so different, I call it the alien. How it
got there, exactly what it does - I haven’t got the first idea.., no
fucking idea at all.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Is it that bad?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Someone’s dropped us in the middle of the
Louvre. We’re blind men and they’ve told us to find the Mona Lisa.
There’s four miles of galleries end we’ve got five minutes to do it.
That’s how I feel -and that’s when rm optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Luc?</p>
<p><strong>demaupassant</strong>: I’m sixty-two years old. I’ve seen us
go from DC3s to landing on the moon. In my life I’ve won all the
glittering prizes. I’ve always believed nothing was beyond the reach of
Man, but I’ll tell you honestly - this may never be unraveled. If it is,
it won’t be in my lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>demaupassant</strong>: So what do we do? I think it’s like
Gatsby -“so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back
ceaselessly into the past.” There’s no other way, ia there?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Luc? You’re certain - about the time, I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>demaupassant</strong>: Sixteen weeks. How far along are
you?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Twelve weeks.</p>
<p><strong>demaupassant</strong>: Good night, Billie.</p>
<p><strong>a tiny fetus</strong>: perfectly formed - floats in the
amniotic fluid. It’s alive - the large head sways, the heart beats
through the translucent ribs.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: So - you’re a little boy. It’s funny - I
think I knew.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We’ve got four weeks. The way I see it
-there’s nothing to lose. I can’t tell you whet’Il happen to us. It’s on
the edge, mister. The air’s so thin out there, we may not even be able
to breathe. But what the hell - it’s a chance.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You want to try it? Sure you do. You’re my
son. We’ve waited all our lives for each other.</p>
<p><strong>a stack of hand-written notepads</strong>: lie on a table in
the basement. We track through them - past computer print-outs and
dog-eared journals. We recognize them - these are Will’s detailed
notes.</p>
<p><strong>inside the tank</strong>: Water sloshes back and forth.
Diamond lowers herself in and floats there. For a moment, she stares up
at the circle of light spilling through the hatch. We hold on her
face.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: So we beat on, boats against the
current.</p>
<p><strong>the sun and the moon</strong>: It’s one of those strange
twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the sky together. Smoke
drifts across them. We tilt down to ape city -</p>
<p><strong>red hot fire</strong>: burns in a huge furnace at one end of
the slaughterhouse. The rickety conveyor belt is working, clattering
away. Several ape workers throw the bodies of the lab animals - the dead
tribes-people - on to the belt.</p>
<p><strong>will’s empty cell</strong>: The door hangs open. The space is
lit by a dozen torches. Drak is alone, moving around the cell, trying to
work out how Will escaped. He looks at the smashed bed, the hole in the
wall, the torn clothing that made the harness.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Clever… you clever fucking animal.</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: My lord…</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: Could I see you please?</p>
<p><strong>the hall of power</strong>: is a magnificent room - stone
columns and towering trees growing in huge pots. At one end is a rock
shelf - open to the gathering twilight. Silhouetted against it,
commanding a view of the entire city, is the Council of Elders. They sit
around a table made from bone and tusks, deep in discussion.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Drak. I was just saying - maybe it’s a
blessing.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: A blessing?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Where there’s one, there must be others. If
we’d killed him, we might never find them.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: But the animal’s not stupid - he knows come
day-break we’ll be tracking him. Who’s to say he’ll run for home?</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: No - he’s not stupid. But even dogs hunt in
packs of seven. Every animal needs its kind. And when we find them -
what then?</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: What do you think?!</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Just like the tribes - burn them out of their
holes, put them to the sword? I don’t mind doing that - I like it - but
it’s never enough, is it? No matter how many we kill, every year they’re
still here. Why will it be any different with the Blue Eyes? What we
need is a final solution.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Doctor Zora’s brought back patients from a
place called Kismatu. I’ve been talking to her about it -</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: What is Kismatu?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: It’s a tiny colony farther out than even the
northern frontier. Females and babies have been dying there.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>cool and lovely room</strong>: There are iron barn on I
series of high windows but in the middle of the room is a jungle-gym.
Underneath it are ape toys. Five baby apes sit on cots. They must be no
more than two or three years old but their faces end bodies are those of
old, old apeswizened and wrinkled, frail with age.</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: We don’t know what causes it- a virus
probably. I’d hoped to complete our research before I came to you with
my proposal. But, given the circumstances -</p>
<p><strong>nazgul i</strong>: It’s a brilliant idea. Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>horses’ hooves</strong>: paw the ground. They’re bound with
cloth to stop them leaving a trail. It’s night -the horses are tethered
near a fire burning in the lee of a rock.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: He’s their leader - he can never take his
eye from the mountain. He has to do what he thinks is right.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: By killing them?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Don’t judge him, Will. I couldn’t have done
it. I wonder if you could? One of those women he just killed wes his
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We call it a Iobotomy. What other things have
you people tried?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fuck you, Strider! Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: don’t know if it’s true.., my sister’s mate
works in the lab. He says Doctor Zora’s working on some disease -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What sort of disease?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Of the children, I think - ape
children.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How did they die, Strider? Old in the belly
-is that how?!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Some of them. You know this disease?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So that’s how it happened. Fuck you
people.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They haven’t done it yet. It may not
work.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They will and it does.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: That’s funny - that’s exactly what an ape
would say.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about you, Strider - why were you in the
cell?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: I fought another ape. Nothing very heroic,
I’m afraid - I was drunk. He fell badly, his head hit the branch of a
tree going down. It broke his neck.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What’s the punishment?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: At the ceremony of summer rites, the high
priest would curse me with death.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You knew, didn’t you? You knew the sun was
going to swallow the moon. That’s why you weren’t afraid.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes - I knew.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve come a long way, Strider - it’s farther
then I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: I’ve heard stories - old apes tell them
’round the fire late at night - of strange lands where the creatures can
tell the future. Is that where you’re from?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In a way.. yeah, it’s something like that.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: So what happens to it afl, to the world
we’ve built? Tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It passes away.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: History remembers, though - it’s passed on,
what we did, I mean?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, Strider - there’s nothing, not a trace
left behind.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: So it’s just vanity then - what we believe,
that the works of the ape will last forever?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, it’s vanity. But not just of apes,
Strider -maybe of men, too.</p>
<p><strong>dust swirling, hooves pounding</strong>: battalions of ape
cavalry sweep out of the stables. Dawn is breaking across the city.
Ma-Gog stands on a ridge, his staff raised, blessing the army as it
rides out.</p>
<p><strong>a rainbow</strong>: arches across the end of a tiny gorge.
Dozens of streams cascade into pools, spilling over ledges and swirling
into ponds. Aragorn leads Will and Strider along a hidden, path - a rock
ledge that runs behind the waterfalls.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: This is the Rainbow Tribe’s cave. They
should be here.</p>
<p><strong>a stone fireplace</strong>: Aragorn places his hand on the
circle of stones, feeling its warmth.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: They left at the rising of the sun.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Why such hurry?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: You heard it?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Animal?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Is there another entrance?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: From the ridge above. Apes?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Scouts probably.</p>
<p><strong>honeycomb of passages</strong>: eep in the cave. A sound -
pebbles falling off a ledge. Then we see a flicker of light - a torch is
moving through a cavern. Whoever holds it, turns a corner and is lost in
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>a crossroads</strong>: of arches and stalactites. Will and
Strider split apart. Will moves silently through the darkness, into a
cavern. Through an archway he sees a shadow on the wall! He goes fast
towards it -</p>
<p><strong>a huge boulder</strong>: The shadow comes round the boulder.
We tilt down and now we see who’s holding the torchDiamondl She’s armed
with a crossbow - cocked end loaded. She turns a corner -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll explain later.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What made you come? I thought the mDNA was
just a theory. One of dozens of theories - isn’t that what you said?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We did a lot of work. I guess I was
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: People have been wrong about a lot of
things.</p>
<p><strong>the great valley</strong>: stretches out below - primordial
forests and cascading streams. Will and Diamond stand on a rock ledge
outside the cave.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is the rift valley in Kenya -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher
but a hundred thousand years of wind and rain will turn it into the
mountain we know. Think of it - we’ve come back a hundred thousand
years! Everyone told me it couldn’t be done, but we’ve crossed the
frontier now - Man has traveled through space and time. How long has
science dreamed of that?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: How long have you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: All my life.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Dream no more. You’ve done it. Like you
said in your note - it was Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah - I really have, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Aragorn - I’ve found it!</p>
<p><strong>a cave painting</strong>: Newly-drawn, is hidden in e nook
high up in the main cave. Strider, Will and Diamond watch aa Aregorn
looks at it by torchlight.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I thought they would leave word for their
hunters. Kip-Kena has called a gathering of the Seven Tribes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Two days’ travel - at the Eagle’s Nest.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We’ll stay hera tonight. Be ready to leave
at first light.</p>
<p><strong>the embers of a fire</strong>: burn in the circle of stones.
Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it. Will and Diamond have been
awake all night. They sit in the shadows near the entrance to the cave,
speaking quietly.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: An ape civilization? You said there was a
city.., what happened to it all?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You know what we’ve found of Aragorn’s whole
race? Seventeen bones, that’s all. Anthropologists have discovered
evidence of the apes - we call them skulls. Bones last a lot longer than
civilizations.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I guess there’s a lesson in that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Listen, Billie - the apes have discovered a
disease.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s really rare and, lucky for them, it’s in
an isolated area. They’re not stupid - they understand it’s potential.
They plan to give it to the tribes -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And maybe they do, but it doesn’t matter
-Aragorn’s people aren’t us. Already evolution’s taken another track
-</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like
us - the first man.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Woman. You said it was in the mitochondrial
DNA - it has to be a woman.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re right. Sooner or later the apes find
her. She doesn’t look like the tribes but the apes don’t care - she’s
human.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: After a hundred thousand years?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The planet’s five billion years old. What’s
that to Nature? A blink of the eye.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: That’s the theory, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: A helluva theory, Doctor Plant.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: There’s not much time, Will. We have to
find her before the apes and we have to do it within four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Jesus, Billie! Four weeks? We’ve got a theory
- that’s all. We don’t even know half the problems we’re dealing with.
You can’t put a deadline on science.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Science, Will? What about people? Isn’t
that what this is all about. I’m sorry - I thought there were children
dying.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sure. Of course it’s about that too.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: But then, you don’t care muchabout people
do you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No - I guess I don’t. Not for a long time.
Ideas and knowledge are what matter. They’re the shining ideals. That’s
the only way we progress.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Progress to what? We’re both children of
our age, aren’t we? We’ve grown up to believe the more we know, the more
advanced we are. But what does that mean if we’ve forgotten the things
of real value. You know the reason I came? It’s got nothing to do with
science or knowledge. I’m going to have a child -that’s why I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Uke you said, the women’s out there
somewhere. Why ere we traveling with them? We should cut ourselves
loose.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We wouldn’t last a day. We’ve got to keep
moving, Billie. The apes are like storm-troopers.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Right behind. I think Strider has some sort of
tribal intuition. He says he can hear their hoof beats in his head.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>a sparkling river</strong>: winds through a beautiful valley.
The two horses splash along the water’s edge. Strider and Aragorn are
mounted on one, Will and Diamond on the other. They turn a curve -
Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>the cave of the rainbow</strong>: Ape soldiers are swarming
over the cave. A TRACKER uses torchlight to study footprints. He looks
up at Orak -</p>
<p><strong>tracker</strong>: There’s four of them, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Four? The Tracker points It a at of prints
-</p>
<p><strong>tracker</strong>: It’s woman. Blue Eyes has a mate.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Excellent. I look forward to meeting her.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: My Lord - hoof prints.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Malakai! Bolag!</p>
<p><strong>an eagle circles</strong>: Soaring and hovering in the sky.
We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in skins edged with feathers - is
perched high on a jagged peak. He’s a LOOKOUT. He tenses -</p>
<p><strong>series of wooden platforms</strong>: are built into the rocky
crags, opening into caves. They are connected by ladders and bridges
slung across dizzying drops. The inhabitants here live with their totem
-this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle.</p>
<p><strong>the lookout post</strong>: Kip follows the direction of the
Lookout’s pointing finger. Will and Diamond lead the other two - all on
foot now - along the path.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s the traveler! With a woman…</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: The fool - he’s brought an ape with himl He
reaches for a bow but Kip’s hand falls on his arm, stopping him.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Who’s the other one, though? Aragorn!</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: It’s the Ranger! The Ranger is free!</p>
<p><strong>on the platforms</strong>: The tribes-people burst into
action - running for the bridges, scaling the ladders.</p>
<p><strong>a wooden bridge swings through the air</strong>: Whack! It
locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse. It’s a primitive
drawbridge. Aragorn steps on to it, leading the others across.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: The ape travels with me - treat him as a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you
my life. Welcome, Traveler.</p>
<p><strong>inside the eagle’s nest</strong>: A series of caves,
connected by vaulted arches, extend in to the mountain. They’re crowded
with members of various tribes - children are playing, flint-knappers
are fashioning tools, women ara cooking.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are the seven tribes here?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: All except the Antelope. They hunt the plains
far to the west - they have the longest journey.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will they come?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Who knows - maybe the apes have found them.
Nobody has seen them for many summers gone. Why?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m searching for someone - a young woman. She
looks like us … I thought she might live with the tribes.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Is she a relative - was she born to your
hearth?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To all of our hearths. My race reveres her. We
think of her as the first woman. Without her. our lives are nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Women are of the spirit - we believe that. too.
Mother Earth mates with the totems. Only through woman can their
children walk the world.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Have you seen her?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’re sure? Perhaps some of the women have
seen something?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: She looks like you, you say? No offense,
Traveler, but the women say you’re the ugliest man they’ve ever seen. A
woman that looks like you - I’m sure they would have talked about
it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ugly?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: I’m sorry I can’t help.</p>
<p><strong>another torch is lit</strong>: They ring the walls of the
small cave. By their light we see the skins, the feathers and the
symbols of each tribe’s totem - the eagle, the tiger, the rainbow…</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: We’ve traveled without rest - there are
soldiers a day behind. The ape says it’s an army.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: And there are more coming from the north. Five
squadrons et least, the runners say. It’s led by the old warrior
Nazgul.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Is that why you called the gathering?</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: Great things are moving, Ranger -</p>
<p><strong>a rainbow</strong>: A stranger walks out of the west, the
moon hides the sun, armies are on the march - come the new moon, nothing
in Middle Earth will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: We either fight or flee - the Tribes must
decide.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I know you, Kip - you always were a
fighter. What do the others say?</p>
<p><strong>eagle</strong>: It doesn’t matter what we say - the Ranger
has returned. We’ll follow wherever he leads.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: I’ll walk the path Mother Earth has laid
for me, but I’ll walk it no more as Ranger.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: A man leads from his heart and winter has
come early to mine. I took the life of my daughter - and some of your
kinfolk with it. I did my duty -nothing more can be asked of I men. But
now others must walk in my place.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: If I should have had a son, I would have
hoped for a man as fine as you. This is my last act as Ranger of the
Easterlings-</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Take care of my father’s people. Guide them
well. You must decide what is best for the Tribes. For me… I was the one
that had to strike the blow, but it was the apes who killed my child.
Tomorrow I will go to fight them. What father could do any less?</p>
<p><strong>kids’ faces, wide-eyed</strong>: They huddle together -
staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape. Strider is building a
small fire at the side of the cave, Diamond lays down furs for sleeping.
, She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the meeting. Will
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They’re going to war. They leave at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They’ll be slaughtered.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: They think if they leave the valley, their
totems won’t follow. Without them, they say they’re dead anyway.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We should go now.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Oh, nol We’re not fighting someone else’s
war -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Listen to me -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We’ve got four weeks, Willl Four weeks to
find her. She’s not here, so whet are we waiting for? Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Listen, Billie! We know the future - but if we
beat the apes, they can’t harm the woman.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Beat the apes?! And say we don’t - or say
one of us gets captured. What then? Don’t you understand? Four
weeksi</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah, I understand - but those things aren’t
going to happen. We know things the apes can’t even dream of. This is
our world, Billie - men won it with their minds. All we need is
knowledge and science. We’ve got them both. We can win!</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What are we going to do - dazzle them with
calculus? This is an army, Will - you said it yourself.
Storm-trooperst</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Look -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Taste it. That’s saltpeter - the natural form
of potassium nitrate. The caves are littered with the stuff. You’ve
smelt the air - there’s sulfur all around. If we burn timber, that’Il
give us charcoal. You’re s scientist - you know what it means.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: It’s strange, isn’t it? Give s man s
problem and the first thing he thinks about is weapons.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’re a frail species, Billea. It’s only
weapons that have made us bigger than we are.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Or smaller.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s the apes who are going to be a whole lot
smaller after this. We can beat themi No more experiments - no more
problem.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I hope your right, Will.</p>
<p><strong>fires burn</strong>: all over the eagle’s nest, turning piles
of timber into charcoal. The camp is a hive of activitycolumns of
tribes-people make their way up from the valley carrying piles of sulfur
rock; women and children sit in circles, pounding the saltpeter into
dust. Will moves among the tribal leaders, watching as they measure and
combine the elements in bowls.</p>
<p><strong>straw man flies towards us</strong>: He looks like a
scarecrow except he’s dressed in captured ape armor. Rigged to a flying
fox, he speeds past a rock face. All of the tribes-people are gathered
on the side of a crevasse, watching.</p>
<p><strong>kip</strong>: You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We’ve still got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Apes believe men are the devil’s children.
Maybe they’re right. What have you done, Will - what have you unleashed
on the world?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Nothing, Strider. The future, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: I can’t fight with you tomorrow, Will. To
kill an ape in a brawl is one thing, but I can’t go to war against my
people.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I never expected you to.</p>
<p><strong>water flying, hooves pounding</strong>: Drak and his cavalry,
pennants flying, gallop along the edge of a river. Ranks of infantry,
followed by horse-drawn supply wagons, travel behind.</p>
<p><strong>the ford of the three rivers</strong>: A jumble of logs and
broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the river. The Praetorian
Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir.</p>
<p><strong>in the trees</strong>: A shadow of movement. Tribesmen glide
through the dappled light of the forest, almost invisible in skins and
camouflage.</p>
<p><strong>trails of fire</strong>: whip along the ground - out of the
forest and on to the flattened rocks that form part of the ford. The
Guards’ horses shy away. The apes look down in puzzlement -</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Apes - chargel</p>
<p><strong>the shore</strong>: Boom… boom! More explosions rip the river
bank to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>in the forest</strong>: Batteries of cross-bows are mounted
on a series of long wooden frames. The Eagle leader and his warriors run
from one to the other, touching flames to rope fuses. Fire sizzles
towards the crossbows, each one loaded with a charge -</p>
<p><strong>on the ford</strong>: The ape cavalry are plunging through
the smoke and debris. Wham! The hail of arrows cut them to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>the jumble of logs</strong>: floats in the middle of the
river. The leader of the Rainbow Tribe, water streaming off of him,
kneels on the tangle of trees and branches, reloading his bow. This is
no jumble of logs - it’s a firing platform they’ve anchored therel</p>
<p><strong>the ford</strong>: Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam
into the milling ranks of apes. Right in front of him, an arrow rips
through the throat of the leader of the Praetorian Guard. Drak turns to
Nazgul, yelling -</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul
spurs his horse back across the weir.</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up
the river bank. Bam! They hear the charges go off - the hurl themselves
down. Another volley of arrows scythes through them -</p>
<p><strong>in the forest</strong>: The Eagle leader and his men work
feverishly to reload and recharge the batteries of crossbows. One of the
warriors looks up - terror on his face.</p>
<p><strong>the ford</strong>: The ape infantry pour across the ford,
charging over the bodies of their fallen comrades.</p>
<p><strong>the forest</strong>: Riderless horses, part of the ape
cavalry, charge wildly through the trees. We tilt up - their riders have
abandoned them and taken to the trees. The branches are thick with apes
firing, cutting down groups of running tribesmen.</p>
<p><strong>the rock platform</strong>: Will and several tribesmen hurl
camouflage aside revealing a long iron barrel wedged in the rocks. One
of the warriors tilts it up, aiming it at the trees; another stokes
pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>a rocky gorge</strong>: Its rugged walls are lined with piles
of huge boulders. Aragorn and a group of warriors are fighting
hand-to-hand, being forced back by scores of ape infantry.</p>
<p><strong>in the trees</strong>: An ape sharpshooter sights down his
crossbow - straight at Aragorn. He fires -</p>
<p><strong>among the boulders</strong>: Wham! The crossbow bolt smashes
into Aragorn’s shoulder, sending him reeling. One of the tribesmen turns
- it’s Kip. He sees Aragorn on his knees.</p>
<p><strong>in the trees</strong>: The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his
sights. His finger reaches for the trigger. He starts to squeeze -</p>
<p><strong>high among the boulders</strong>: Will. He stands almost at
the top of the gorge, lowering a crossbow. He looks down at Kip’s men -
the apes, vastly superior in numbers, are swarming forward, driving the
tribesmen back.</p>
<p><strong>on theground</strong>: Apes are rushing forward. They hear
the explosion. Several apes turn - the huge boulder, split into chunks,
flies towards them. The apes scatter. Smashl The chunks knock apes aside
like skittles.</p>
<p><strong>the dust from the explosion</strong>: swirls past Drak. He
looks up - he sees Will on the ridge, silhouetted against the sky.</p>
<p><strong>on the ridge</strong>: Will moves fast along the top of the
ridge. He stops - looking down on the river. On the other side, Nazgul
and a platoon of apes unload huge leather bladders from the wagons and
empty them into the river.</p>
<p><strong>the side of a cliff</strong>: Will falls down, down,
down.</p>
<p><strong>in the river</strong>: A tree branch and other flotsam is
being carried downstream by the current. A pair of hands emerge from the
water and grab hold of it. Will’s head follows.</p>
<p><strong>the oil slick</strong>: erupts in flames as the arrow hits
it. The whole surface of the river is suddenly transformed into a raging
blaze.</p>
<p><strong>in the river</strong>: The current pulls Will down the river.
He looks back - the molten fire spills over the weir. Anguished screams
are carried on the wind. A pillar of black, oily smoke rises up high
into the sky -</p>
<p><strong>the eagles’ nest</strong>: The platforms and rocky outcrops
are crowded with the women, children and old folks. Diamond and Strider
stand together. All of them stare down at the river valley. The pillar
of smoke rises higher.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They’re here!</p>
<p><strong>outside the main cave</strong>: A chorus of chattering
voices. The new arrivals are surrounded by members of their sister
tribes. The leader of the Antelope stands in the center, listening to a
woman -Kip’s wife. Whatever she’s saying is lost in the hubbub.</p>
<p><strong>antelope</strong>: Quiet!</p>
<p><strong>antelope</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>antelope</strong>: We go - now!</p>
<p><strong>diamond and strider</strong>: stand on the platform, watching
several old men lower the drawbridge. Whack! It locks into place. The
antelope warriors cross it and disappear down a narrow trail.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: She’s here.., holy God - she’s herel It’s
not a woman - it’s a child!</p>
<p><strong>a young girl</strong>: helps her mother set up camp. She is
about 10 years old, tawny-haired, taller and straighter-backed’than any
of her people. She looks like us.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Her name is Aiv.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Ev? Of course. My people have a name like
that - “Eve” is how we say it.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I’ve come a long way to find you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: To keep you safe.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do you have children?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I was hoping you had a son. Aiv’s a sweet
girl. She’s the child of my heart. But the way she looks, nobody will
want her as a mate.</p>
<p><strong>swirls of dust</strong>: rise up from I mountain path.
Whatever’s causing it is hidden from view by the peaks and crags. The
tribal-people gather on vantage points, watching it come closer. Strider
cocks his head - listening. A shadow of fear passes across his face.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Horses! It’s horses!</p>
<p><strong>broad wooden platform</strong>: An ape horseman flies across
the platform. He leaps off the edge, on to a lower platform. Diamond’s
right in front of him!</p>
<p><strong>a rock shelf</strong>: She looks across the broad area in
front of the cave - apes everywhere, weapons flashing, people
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>in front of the cave</strong>: Diamond runs faster than she’s
ever run, sprinting to grab Eva. Drak wheels his horse - he sees
Diamond. His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the Blue Eyes! And a
woman! He leaps his horse forward -</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: Grab the female!</p>
<p><strong>high rock ledge</strong>: Strider - Diamond clutched under
his arm - lands on a ledge high above the fight. Diamond turns fast and
looks back -</p>
<p><strong>in front of the cave</strong>: Eve crouches over the body of
her mother. The woman’s mouth is frozen in an anguished scream, her dead
eyes stare straight ahead. Eva shakes her, desperately hoping for some
sign of life. Nothing. Eve starts to cry.</p>
<p><strong>on the rock ledge</strong>: Diamond, anguished, tries to go
to the little girl but Strider holds her in an iron grip. He swings
Diamond off her feet, and leaps for an overhanging branch of a tree. He
jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from sight.</p>
<p><strong>charred and smoking wreckage</strong>: floats at the shore of
the river. It is what remains of the firing platform - the bodies of
several of the Rainbow warriors still on board.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I was so sure…</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: You said we’d win.</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: You gave us hope - that was the cruelest
thing.</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: Get the weapons you need. The apes’Il be
coming back for their dead. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>clouds of smoke</strong>: rise into the sky - the eagle’s
nest is on fire. Drak and his apes make their way along a narrow
mountain trail - they’ve put the humans’ camp to the torch.</p>
<p><strong>huge rock overhang</strong>: high up the mountain-side.
Standing underneath it, hidden in shadow, are Diamond and Strider. They
look down on the mountain trail. Diamond sees Eve.</p>
<p><strong>the mountain trail</strong>: The young girl stumbles along
the road, tied by a length of chain to Drak’s saddle. She’s bruised and
bleeding, her ankles shackled, barely able to walk.</p>
<p><strong>the rock overhang</strong>: Diamond looks at her, close to
tears, but there’s nothing she can do. She watches the convoy wind along
the trail.</p>
<p><strong>in the river</strong>: It’s twilight. Will and the Lookout
are wading around a knob of land that protects one end of a tiny
beach.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: It’s called the Crossroads of the Fallen
King - it’s where our forefathers are laid to rest. It’s sacred to us -
anyone who’s still alive will make their way here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s Kip’s wife. She’s come from</p>
<p><strong>the eagle’s nest -</strong>: He goes towards her, passing the
other tribes-people. Nobody greets him. They just watch him pass. He
stops in front of Kip’s wife. Her eyes are red from crying.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: rm sorry about your mate.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve been to the eagle’s nest. I was looking
for the woman I was with. We searched but… What happened - was she
captured?</p>
<p><strong>kip’s wife</strong>: I threw myself off a platform. I don’t
know what happened to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>shaft of moonlight</strong>: shimmers on the water. Will sits
on a rock that straggles into the water. His face is grim, his heart
heavy with grief. He’s making something with his hands - twisting and
turning them - but in the dim light we can’t see what it is.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cave</strong>: A shaft of moonlight falls on a
semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their end - it’s like Stonehenge.
The surviving tribes-people are gathered in their shadow.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It’s half a day since the battle. Any that
survived would be here by now - we are all that remains of the Seven
Tribes. The Ranger himself died on the field. We must decide ourselves
what to do.</p>
<p><strong>wounded warrior</strong>: Like you say, Kip is dead. Maybe
it’s a sign -the Rangers have left Middle Earth forever. Perhaps it’s
telling us to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Leave the valley? This is where the
eagles fly. This is their home. Nobody can live without their totem - we
all know that!</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we
stay here, we die. But if we travel beyond the Tower of the Moon, we’ve
got a chance. Who knows - maybe our totems will follow us?</p>
<p><strong>the beach</strong>: Now we see what Will has been making -
it’s a boat made out of twigs and leaves. A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged
mast. He leans forward and drops it in the water. He watches the current
carry it away. Farther and farther it bobs out into the river -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m sorry, Billie. I should have listened - it
wasn’t our war. All you wanted was a baby…</p>
<p><strong>in the river</strong>: The current carries the boat past a
jagged boulder. An ape’s hand reaches out and picks it up. He lifts it
up to look more closely. We see his face - it’s Strider. He turns the
toy over in his hand, looking at it quizzically. He hands it to Diamond,
wading along behind him -</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: It looks like someone made it.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: It’s a boat - it’s gaff-rigged. Oh,
Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>on the beach</strong>: Will is walking up the beach. He
stops, listening. He hears it again -his name! He turns and heads
towards the river. He sees Diamond coming round the headland, splashing
through the water.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I thought I’d lost you.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How did you find this place?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Strider. His father was a tracker. We’ve
been following a trail for hours.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: He saved my life, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thank you, my friend - thank you.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: What did you expect? You would have done
the same for me.</p>
<p><strong>shower of sparks</strong>: as Will puts a log on the fire.
From inside the cave we hear the murmur of voices as the argument goes
back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Some times when we want something so bad, we
can take a thing and twist it in our head. You’re sure about this,
Billie?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I’m pregnant, Will - I’m not crazy. She’s
not like them - she’s a mutation. Evolution’s always trying to improve
on itself. It’s turned out a child that can walk taller and run faster,
one whose brain-pan holds a mind that can think laterally. I’ve seen
her, Will. I’ve held her in my arms - she was us.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You said she was with Drak.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: On a chain.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s two days’ march to the city. Was she
wounded - can she make it?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: She can make it. Will?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It’s decided - we’re leaving the valley
forever. Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have
been broken. Long may their spirits haunt you You and your mate can
travel with u but we’ve got misery enough to carry. Our hearth is not
home to ny ape.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Then it’s not home to us. The ape’s better
than any man I’ve known.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Go with them. Will - everyone needs their
own kind.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Of course we can’t… The city, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We call it a city - it’s more like a fortress,
Billie. It can’t be done.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: The three of you got out - everyone thought
that was impossible too.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We were lucky. But that’s the trouble with
luck - it runs out. I don’t want to be back in the city when it
does.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What about Eve - what do we do, just forget
about her?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. Maybe we can’t stop the apes giving her
the disease - but they’ll have to turn her loose. That’s the only way
she can infect others. So we lay a plan and we find her. Then it’s our
job to stop her having children. If we can do that, it can’t be passed
on through the race.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: How long will that take - less than
twenty-five days ?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We can’t take our eye off the goal. If we
solve this, you can have other children. Not if wa throw our lives away,
though.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Whose, Will - whose children?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: guess that’s your call.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What sort of father would you make? You
told me once the only thing that matters is knowledge. That’s wrong.
Science and technology can only take you so far - in the end it’s our
humanity that maners. That’s what makes us great. You’re a wonderful
scientist, Will -but what sort of person are you? What would you do if
it was your child?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I don’t know how to do it - not the humanity
part, that’s easy compared to getting into the city. I just don’t
know…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It sits on a river. There’s only one bridge
-heavily guarded. Even if we could cross it, all the ridges and roads
are patrolled -</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: There’s one place that’s not.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Down here - it’s called Funeral Rock. It
sits at the bottom of the temple. From there you can make your way into
the city. Even so, you still have to cross the river.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Maybe there is a way…across the river, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’ll love it - there’s barely any science to
it at all.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: We’re going? Is that right - we’re
going!?</p>
<p><strong>three silhouettes</strong>: travel fast along a high ridge.
The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind them. We recognize their
physiques - Will in the lead, then Diamond and Strider. As they cross
the face of the sun, we dissolve to -</p>
<p><strong>lights twinkle</strong>: on the buildings and terraces of the
apes’ city. Will and his two comrades are on a bluff, looking down. The
sound of music and laughter drifts towards them on the night air.
Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out of a stone chimney.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They’ve started up the furnace. Let the
games begin.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What games?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The apes kill their prisoners for sport. The
furnace takes care of the bodies.</p>
<p><strong>a hidden ledge</strong>: much closer to the city. Will and
the others move fast along it, deep in the shadows. The river thunders
by below them, separating them from the city. The only way across is the
massive iron and wood bridge. Ape guards patrol it.</p>
<p><strong>a steel arrow</strong>: flies through the air. Tied to its
shaft, trailing out behind, is a rope made from vines. Will lowers a
crossbow. He watches the arrow fly through the mist and spray -</p>
<p><strong>the river</strong>: races by just below and pours over the
Falls of No Return. Whack! The arrow buries itself in the trunk of a
massive tree standing on the bank.</p>
<p><strong>on the other shore</strong>: Will and Strider haul the rope
taut and tie it round a tree. It stretches from one side of the river to
the other. All it has to do is hold. Will turns to Diamond. He shouts to
be heard over the roar of the falls -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You first. We’ll be right behind.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: It sure as shit ain’t Kansas, is it?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>the tree trunk</strong>: The arrow pulls part way out of the
tree. The steel shaft shivers but it holds. Everything seems okay.
Suddenly -</p>
<p><strong>on the rope</strong>: Everything bucks and shudders. Diamond
screams. She looks down - straight into the vortex of the whirlpool. Her
blood runs cold - she freezes.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go! Billie - go!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Billiai What about the baby?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Move, Billiel Nowl</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: The arrow moves another inch out of
the trunk. The rope fixed to its shaft is strained to breaking point.
But still everything holds…</p>
<p><strong>the iron and wood bridge</strong>: One of the guards patrols
the bridge. Out of the corner of his eye - flash of something. He looks
towards the Falls.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Gimla.</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: Another strand of the rope breaks. We
follow it as it unravels - past Diamond and Will. Before we get to
Strider it stops - a section of the rope is so badly frayed it can’t go
any farther. It’s going to break any moment.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: They’ve seen usl Will looks up-river to the
bridge. Through a hole in the mist he sees ape guards pointing and
yelling. A whole squadron runs to join them.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: No! Save yourselfl</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope
and is trying to pull it in. The weight - of the men and the current -
make it impossible. All she can do is try and hold them.</p>
<p><strong>on the rope</strong>: Strider’s fingers are slipping free.
Will grabs him - man and ape, hand to paw. Will holds him.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: We’ll both die. Let gol Will shakes his
head - no. Hanging on to the rope one-handed, the current tearing at his
body, he tries to haul Strider in.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Another minute, we’ll both be dead. Do it,
Willl</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: If nothing else, I made it to the Falls No
Return.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The sacred words, Strider - what are the
words?!</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: “In the beginning…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: ‘In the beginning was the word and the word
wes God…’</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: You know the words?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You’ll walk in the next world, Strider.</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ve seen the future, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>strider</strong>: Good-bye Will. Take care of Billie.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And the word was God. Yea, though I walk
through the valley of death, I will fear no evil…</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all
the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Amen.</p>
<p><strong>on the bridge</strong>: We see who’s been coordinating the
firing. It’s Drak. Archers are kneeling on the bridge, trying to sight a
target through the foaming water and clouds of mist.</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: Diamond ia hauling on the rope,
pulling it in. Will, up to his neck in water, tows himself along it. His
feet find a footing - he starts to scramble up the bank. Diamond goes
towards him -</p>
<p><strong>on the bridge</strong>: moment’s long enough. Drak’s seen
him. In one fluid movement he adjusts his aim and fires -</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: Diamond is almost in Will’s arms.
Sswhack! The arrow rips into WiU’s back, through his ribs. He pitches
forward. Diamond screams. He falls into her arms.</p>
<p><strong>huge stone arch</strong>: The survivors of the Seven Tribes
travel fast along a forest trail. All of them are burdened down with
possessions, weary from the road - they are leaving the valley.</p>
<p><strong>kip’s wife</strong>: We thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Hunted, but not dead. A dozen of us were
driven back in the battle -</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: For three days a squadron of apes have
tracked us. Last night we ambushed them. We’re heading now for the
eagle’s nest.</p>
<p><strong>kip’s wife</strong>: There is no eagle’s nest.</p>
<p><strong>kip’s wife</strong>: We’re all that’s left of the Seven
Tribes.</p>
<p><strong>a fire crackles</strong>: All of the tribes-people are
gathered around it.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: There is no-one else, Aragorn - you are the
Ranger.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: No. We must all follow the trail we think
best. You’ve decided yours. For me I’ll go to the city of the apes and
take what revenge I can. I’ll go alone - but like the traveler, I think
death will be the only thing I find there.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Then it will find us, too. Warriors follow
their Ranger. That’s always been the way of it in Middle Earth.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: But nothing’s the same now. Think of the
women-folk. What will become of them?</p>
<p><strong>kip’s wife</strong>: You’re right - there’s so few of us now,
nothing is the same. You must allow the women to follow, too.</p>
<p><strong>lookout</strong>: I found it on the battlefield. There were
those who said the Rangers had left Middle Earth forever - I didn’t know
what to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: Douse the fire. The Seven Tribes are going
to war.</p>
<p><strong>on the shore</strong>: The apes, carrying torches, search the
river bank and surrounding cliffs. We push in on a pool of darkness
behind them -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You can’t go on, Will - not like this.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What about the baby?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I’ll keep going - I’ll try and get Eve.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Alone? Don’t be ridiculous -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Look at you - you can barely walk.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: If I can just get up - help me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Don’t do this to me - pleasel</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: You’ve done enough - more than anyone else
could. You’re one of the finest men</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Billie!She’s almost through the tangled
roots.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I made a mistake once - I went on a journey
with someone I loved. At the end, I let her go into danger alone.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Where was that - Berkeley, Will?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I knew I’d found the chemical key. I was
working with three young researchers. One of them was a woman called Ali
Conoily. We were engaged. They were the ones that went into the tanks. I
didn’t know as much as I thought I did. They died in there.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Why didn’t you go, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We all wanted to. It was a great adventure. Wa
drew lots for it. I should never have agreed, but we were young - and
like the young we thought life would last forever.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Robert Plant died too, didn’t he - in a
way?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The experiment was unauthorized. There was an
inquiry. They said the theory had no basis. ’Ludicrous” was a word they
used. My career had gone up like a rocket. It came down like the stick.
I couldn’t find work anywhere</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: “Will Robinson” - that was your joke, I
guess. You were Lost in Space, were you?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yeah, but I never realized it’d be so
appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: had twenty years to work out where my research
went wrong - so what, though. It was just a mind game. But I’ve learnt a
lot of things - the most important is that sometimes you get a second
chance. A second chance for a lot of things -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And when you do, you have to grab it and make
sure you never let it go. I’ve got the heart, Billie. It’s my body
that’s failing me.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Give me your hand, Will.</p>
<p><strong>a giant chasm</strong>: It’s several hours before dawn. In
the gloom - whooshl Kip’s Wife rides a flying fox across a precipitous
drop.</p>
<p><strong>the funeral rock</strong>: juts out into the roaring river.
Will and Diamond scramble out of the darkness and land on the rock.
Will’s face is haggard with pain but he forces himself forward. He’s
loosening up. going faster as he moves -</p>
<p><strong>a darkened room</strong>: Torches flicker on the walls. From
somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear the sound of a crowd. A young
ape, barely in his teens, stands in the middle of the room, almost
naked. His face is painted with strange ochre markings.</p>
<p><strong>the stables</strong>: The sound of the crowd is much louder
here but still we don’t see them. The prisoners from the Eagle’s Nest
are crowded into the corrals.</p>
<p><strong>an arena</strong>: -like a small bullring - in the center of
the stables. Now we see the crowd - apes, all males, sit in the
bleachers. They roar as a door is opened and the young Tribe-Boy is
pushed into the ring.</p>
<p><strong>in the corral</strong>: The Boy’s mother is huddled down,
being comforted by other tribes-people. A huge roar goes up from the
arena as the first blow is struck. The sound carries over to -</p>
<p><strong>a terrace</strong>: Drak is alone, walking a high ridge. He
stops, looking down on the twinkling lights. The city is virtually
deserted but Drak doesn’t move - he’s uneasy, troubled by something he
can’t put a name to.</p>
<p><strong>the cool and lovely room</strong>: The five baby apes sit on
cots. They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe into the smallest
ape’s arm. The baby starts to cry. Doctor Zora comforts her as she draws
out a cup of blood. She turns to her assistant, Ben-Guri</p>
<p><strong>doctor zora</strong>: Is the girl animal ready?</p>
<p><strong>ben-guri</strong>: They’re doing it now.</p>
<p><strong>inside the laboratory</strong>: Eve is struggling and crying
as an ape guard carries her towards an operating table. He and another
guard start to strap her down.</p>
<p><strong>vet</strong>: That must be Zors with the blood.</p>
<p><strong>outside the hall of learning</strong>: Drak turns a corner of
the building. He stops and touches the ground with his finger. He lifts
it to his mouth and tastes it. He rises to his feet, following trail of
blood.</p>
<p><strong>a torch</strong>: is ripped from a bracket. It’s Drak.. He
shines it down into a stone well. The flame splits the darkness.
Floating in the water at the bottom of the well is an ape guard -dead,
an arrow through his throat.</p>
<p><strong>in the arena</strong>: The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust,
bleeding badly from a rip across his ribs. His spear lies next to him, a
wooden shield raised across his head. The Teenage ape , rains blows down
on it with a sword.</p>
<p><strong>apes</strong>: Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p><strong>a stone corridor</strong>: Will’s got Eve slung over his
shoulder. They’re stumbling down a corridor - past other labs and
research rooms. They burst through a sat of doors, into -</p>
<p><strong>a courtyard</strong>: at the back of the Hall of Learning.
It’s deep in shadow. From behind they hear the sound of pounding feet.
Will looks around, not sure which way to go. He glances across a terrace
- the doors to the stables fly open. The ape warriors charge out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can you ride?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go for the stables. Head for the eagle’s nest.
I’ll try to join you there.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Delay them. Now go, Billie. Go!</p>
<p><strong>the primitive elevator</strong>: rops down the side of the
ravine. Standing on it are Nazgul and about</p>
<p><strong>the primitive elevator</strong>: a dozen Praetorian Guards.
Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums are lighting up the
streets and terraces. Ape soldiers are running everywhere -
searching.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The flame-thrower rolls along a
street. The driver’s canopy is hidden by flapping tarpaulins. In the
chaos nobody pays it any attention.</p>
<p><strong>on the elevator</strong>: Nazgul sees the machine rolling
towards them.</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: That’s strange - why does Drak need the
Flame?</p>
<p><strong>nazgul</strong>: Stopl Take it backl</p>
<p><strong>the flame-thrower</strong>: dead guard is draped over the
side of the machine, blood dripping from his headWill is in the cabin,
working the controls. He sees the elevator slow in mid-descent. He
throws a lever forward. For a moment, nothing. Then -</p>
<p><strong>the central square</strong>: Smash! It hits the ground in a
shower of blazing timbers and dead apes. Ape soldiers - standing nearby
- stare in shock. The smell of roasted ape fills the air.</p>
<p><strong>eve sits alone</strong>: She’s on the floor of the stables,
deep in shadow. She’s scared, looking ahead -</p>
<p><strong>the prisoners</strong>: are shackled in the corrals. They see
Diamond running out of the shadows towards them. She tossel them the
keys -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Arm yourselves. Find Will - he needs youl
She turns and goes. The prisoners start to unlock the chains.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows,
sweeps her up and keeps running.</p>
<p><strong>in the arena</strong>: The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where
they fell, their spilt blood staining the dust.</p>
<p><strong>in the corrals</strong>: Diamond gallops a stallion through
the corrals. Eve’s clutching the saddle in front of her - hair flying,
her eyes sparkling with exhilaration. The stallion gallops faster.</p>
<p><strong>clouds of smoke and flame</strong>: The crashed elevator hal
set the surrounding buildings on fire. Ape city is burning.</p>
<p><strong>in the cabin</strong>: Will sees Drak and the guards appear
through the swirling clouds of smoke. They look like the horsemen of the
apocalypse. As Will throws the lever we sea a primitive gauge above his
head. It’s in the red -</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Whoosh! The tongue of flame shoots
through the smoke. It touches the guards with a deadly kiss, throwing
them screaming from their horses. But Drak blasts through -</p>
<p><strong>in the cabin</strong>: Will is engulfed in a backdraft of
black oily smoke. He peers through it - Drak charges towards him! Will
hits the lever again. The flame erupts from the barrel. Then it dies -
out of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Drak gallops forward. He raises
weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon. He aims -</p>
<p><strong>in the cabin</strong>: Will throws himself aside. He smashes
both hands down on a lever on the floor. A hiss of steam. The machine
lurches forward -</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Drak tries to get a clear shot at
Will. The machine gathers speed down the incline, coming straight
towards Drak. He veers his horse aside and wheels around. He charges
alongside the cabin - it’s empty</p>
<p><strong>on the machine</strong>: Will clings to the outside of the
Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled square. He’s out of sight of
Drak - but not for long. The ape and his stallion loom into view behind
the machine, Will scrambles back into the cabin -</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Apes are scattering as the runaway
machine flies across the square. Drak is at full gallop, veering from
one side of the Flame to the other. Will clambers back and forth - cat
and mouse at full tilt.</p>
<p><strong>inside the house</strong>: The barrel of the Flame acts like
a battering ram - it blasts through the walls in a shower of burning
timbers. It crashes through the kitchen and stops in a courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>city street</strong>: Diamond’s horse flies down a street - a
high terrace towers on one side, a row of burning buildings on the
other. The road turns right. She swings around it - apes! A platoon of
them right in front of her. She screams at Eve -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: stands on a terrace, his cloak blowing in
the wind, his one cruel eye blazing with anger. Flanked by two ape
warriors, he looks down on the burning buildings.</p>
<p><strong>ma-gog</strong>: Kill him! In the name of God, kill himl
Sswhish! The blade of a sword cleaves through frame. It cuts one of the
ape warriors from neck to waist. Ma-Gog spins - it’s Aragorn, armed to
the teeth, behind them.</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: For my people!</p>
<p><strong>aragorn</strong>: And this - for my daughterl He drives the
spear into the High Priest’s heart. The cruel eye flickers and dies.</p>
<p><strong>on the rooftop</strong>: Will has seen it all. He screams
-</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Behind you! Aragorn - behind!</p>
<p><strong>on the terrace</strong>: Aragorn turns. It’s Drak, on
horseback, thundering down on him. But the leader of the Seven Tribes
knows no fear - only the memory of his lost child.</p>
<p><strong>on the rooftop</strong>: Will stares in anguish. He turns
away - he sees Diamond. She’s at full gallop - Eve clinging to her back
- charging along a road several terraces below. She’s got a clear run
for the iron bridge and freedom.</p>
<p><strong>inside a house</strong>: An ape mother cowers in a corner,
her two children clutched to her, the sounds of battle all around. She
looks up in terror -</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: and Eve fly down charred street .They head
towards a large open square.</p>
<p><strong>outside the stables</strong>: Smoke and dust swirl through
the air. The freed prisoners are fighting ape infantry. Drak races past
the battle. The rope from the harpoon is tied around the saddle,
dragging Aragorn’s body through the dust.</p>
<p><strong>a curved road</strong>: on a high terrace. Flying around a
corner - Will! His coat is billowing, the horse’s mane streaming in the
wind. He hits the straight-away and gallops even faster.</p>
<p><strong>on the road</strong>: Eve clings tight to Diamond’s waist.
The little girl looks back - Drak is thundering behind them, pennants
snapping in the wind, armor glinting on the horse’s chest. It’s an
awesome sight.</p>
<p><strong>out of the tunnel</strong>: comes Will. He looks down to the
lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming back towards him! He turns the
horse around - back into the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>down a rocky sude</strong>: into a dead-end cul-de-sac just
above the roadway. Apesi Two of them are guarding the Claw and the
Bells. Will fires from the shoulder - he drops the first ape.</p>
<p><strong>on the road</strong>: Diamond’s horse is lathered in sweat,
almost blown. Eve looks over her shoulder, her eyes wide with fear -
Drak is close behind, gaining at every step.</p>
<p><strong>in the cul-de-sac</strong>: Will leaps from the Balls on to
the Claw.</p>
<p><strong>on the road</strong>: Drak swings the harpoon on to his
shoulder. He sights down the barrel. Eve sees the weapon lock on to
their backs. She screams a warning et Diamond -</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Billie!</p>
<p><strong>on the claw</strong>: Will is in the driver’s seat. He throws
a lever - nothing happens. He tries another -the long jib that supportl
the two iron jews swings towards the road.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: aims the harpoon. He’s got Eve end Diamond,
one behind the other, in his sights.</p>
<p><strong>drak</strong>: A bargain - two for the price of onel</p>
<p><strong>on the claw</strong>: Will spins a small steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>on the road</strong>: Drak is close behind Diamond. The
harpoon’s massive spring is coiled. Drak’s finger curls around the
trigger, about to fire.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Keep your hands off her, you dirty ape.</p>
<p><strong>in the square</strong>: Apes stare up at their warrior lord,
clamped in the Clew. He let out a blood curdling scream. The bottom half
of his torso - everything from the waist down - falls towards the
ground. Maybe it’s just the wind, but the legs still seem to be
kicking.</p>
<p><strong>on the road</strong>: Diamond end Eve have dismounted.
Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming towards her. She holds out her
arms and they embrace. Neither one says a word, they just hold each
other tight.</p>
<p><strong>clouds of smoke</strong>: almost obscure the setting sun.
Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge watching the tribes-people.
They’ve harnessed horses to ropes tied around the statues on the avenue
of idols - one after another the stone monoliths come crashing down.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: If nothing else, we helped the tribes take
back their valley.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Our valley, too Billia.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There’s one thing I never told you - I never
worked out how to get back.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: A small point. But give me some credit. I’m
a scientist - I knew that.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But you came anyway.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: That was love.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For the baby?</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: For the both of you.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: I only have one regret. We’ll never know if
we succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Of course we will. You’re pregnant - if the
baby’s born alive, we’ll know it worked.</p>
<p><strong>sunlight glistens on the ocean</strong>: The surf rolls in on
a golden beach. At the water’s edge, a line of footprints. We follow
them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff. He’s building something out
of iron and rock and sand but we can’t make out what it is.</p>
<p><strong>diamond</strong>: Will He turns and runs to the mouth of a
large cave.</p>
<p><strong>inside the cave</strong>: Diamond lies on her back on a pile
of animal skins. Her belly is exposed, heaw with the unborn child. Eve
crouches next to her, trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s started? She nods her head then grimaces
with pain as another contraction starts.</p>
<p><strong>the sun is setting on the sea</strong>: From inside the cave,
we hear Diamond scream.</p>
<p><strong>in the cave</strong>: Will kneels between Diamond’s legs. Her
face, glistening with sweat; is a mask of pain. She holdl Eve’s hind
tight and pushes.</p>
<p><strong>the cave</strong>: Will and Eve help Diamond. She comes out
of the cave, still holding the baby. It’s magic hour - they stand on a
rock ledge, looking at the ocean washed with color from the setting
sun.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s to make sure we never forget where we
came from. The baby starts to cry. Will puts one arm each around Diamond
and Eve.</p>
