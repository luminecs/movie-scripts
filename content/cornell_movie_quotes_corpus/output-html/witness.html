<h1 id="witness">witness</h1>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: …a brother has been called home. God has
spoken through the death of our neighbor, Jacob Lapp…</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: …husband of Rachel, father to Samuel, son
of Eli. His chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no
more. He was needed in our presence, but God needs such men, too. That
one should be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. Still, we would not wish
him back. Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: Lapp was a good farmer. None better.</p>
<p><strong>beiler</strong>: But not the man to buy a horse for you.
Hochstetler, wasn’t it your father sold him that horse with a ruptured
testicle?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Told him it was a bee sting made him limp that
way.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: That horse had one good ball. That’s
all it takes.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let us
hope he walks close with God.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sure he does, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: I… I was at the feed store. And I saw
your horse, so…</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: You will come back soon?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Quickly, Mother Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You be careful out among them English.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I need time, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Look, Mama…!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I see, darling.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Is this where we’re going?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Of course not. We’re going to Baltimore.
It’s much nicer in Baltimore.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where is that
train, please?</p>
<p><strong>ticket seller</strong>: Delayed three hours. You’ll hear an
announcement when it’s time to board.</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: Will you come on, for Christ’s sakes!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You found the body?</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported it.
It was the kid.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What kid?</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: How’n hell do I know what kid? The kid in
the funny black threads.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Hi, kid.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What do you want of my son?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’m a police officer. I’m going to have to
talk to the boy. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here
is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me… our train is leaving
soon.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: There’ll be another train. The man who was
killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It’s my job to find out who did it.
I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Who’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Who’d you see, Sam? The man on the floor?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: No… I saw the man who killed him.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Anybody know about this?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I didn’t even know about it.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked
like?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: his clothes and</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Black… I understand. What else,Sam?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Not Zwartich, like him �</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Try that one again, Sam �</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: May I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Zwartich. It’s the way we say… dwarf. Not
like him… very big.</p>
<p><strong>donahue</strong>: Close it all down… I want a man on every
exit… I want the lab in here now! And I want to talk to you,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: All right, talk.</p>
<p><strong>donahue</strong>: This is homicide � not Internal Affairs! So
why are you behaving like you own this case?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: We were running Zenovitch… That’s all I can
tell you. But I want it, Terry. I’ve got a call into Schaeffer.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Momma… are they angry with us.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No… No. It is just the English way.</p>
<p><strong>donahue</strong>: You ought to think about coming back to
Homicide, Johnny… Stick with Internal Affairs and you’re not gonna have
any friends left.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’ll buy a dog.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: How reliable is this kid?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Oh, he’s good.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Amish.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names
tonight � street chemists… the guys processing this P2P into speed.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: So one of them got to him.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You know who?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You’re still convinced there’s a link to
the department?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: If there isn’t I’ve just wasted the last six
months.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: That’s the problem. We need results. The
press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the ‘speed
capitol of the country’. You know the sort of thing. It’s getting
political. The Commissioner’s getting very uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I’ll make it, but
Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they’ll blow the
whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: When word gets out that Zenovitch was a
cop, all hell will break lose. You’ve got 24 hours. That’s all I can
give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go
back to the Homicide Department.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Tell you what… why don’t you and that
blonde � what’s-her-name � come over for dinner Sunday. How ’bout
that.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What’s-her-name moved to Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Well, anyway, don’t get crazy. I’ll do
something for Zenovich’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I got there late, John.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Let’s just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich
made a mistake. You didn’t let anybody down. It happens �</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are you taking us?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: We’re looking for a suspect. We’ve reason to
believe he’s still in the area.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You have no right to keep us here.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a
homicide.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t understand, we have nothing to do
with your laws!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Doesn’t surprise me. I meet a lot of people
like that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s not a joke.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You’re right. It’s not a joke. Listen, I know
a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and
I’m really sorry you an Samuel got involved.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He wants to know who you are. Your name. I
told him we don’t need to know anything about you.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Book. John Book</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sammy, where’s Coalmine?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What you got there, the Salvation Army?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Coalmine.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Try “Happy Valley”.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Put some light on him.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Look at him.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: John Book, you listen to me! I will have no
further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us!</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No! We do not stay in hotels.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How could you do this to me tonight? I told
you I had company</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sorry. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Where’s Timmy and Buck?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Upstairs, asleep. Where’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You’ve got a man here and the kids are
upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: That’s none of your goddamn business! So
keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut! Anyway, they like
Fred.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Oh sure, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Who are these orphans, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: They’re Amish.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: John said you’re Amish.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I don’t want to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: They are English. They don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I wish dawdie was with us.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Wrong door, kid.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You didn’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wanted to. you were kind to take us in
last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your
brother. He’s so… agaanisish!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Just a minute. I’ll pour you some
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re not carrying a bullwhip… how’d you
manage to put my kids to work?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I made it a contest… the one who does best
gets his cereal back first. Children like to help… they only need to be
kept after a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh, is that so? No offense, lady, but I’m
not so sure I like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place
upside down!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please, I didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I know exactly what you meant! Listen, maybe
I’m not a world-class housefrau, but maybe I don’t have time to polish
the goddamn china and keep after the kids! It’s none of your business,
but I don’t happen to have a man around here full time. So I sell
cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes I can even pay the rent
on time! So maybe I’m not Mary Poppins, but maybe I don’t need to have
it jammed down my throat like this.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: There is that clean enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Jesus, Elaine… Somebody die and leave you a
broom?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Go to hell, Fred!</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: What’s bugging her?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I brought your coffee.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it that way.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s okay. Look, I shouldn’t have blown my
top. It’s like… somehow… I’ve let everything get away from me. And you
sort of made me face it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at
him.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: God, Fred…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: At home you’d never hear a woman scream at a
man that way.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You just wouldn’t. It’s not the Amish way.
But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your
brother last night.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Listen, I don’t know what’s going on or how
you got mixed up with him, but don’t you let that self-righteous son of
a bitch push you around, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Now what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The problem is I don’t happen to think my
son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under
his coat and goes around whacking people.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Whacking?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes. And I also want to leave this city.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Believe me, I’m trying to get this over with
as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and
testify.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We do not go into your courts.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: People who don’t go into our courts when
they’re told to sometimes go directly into our jail.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Look, I’m genuinely sorry…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No you’re not � You’re glad, because now
you’ve got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They
don’t seem to like you very much.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: They kid a lot.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I would not be too sure.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He says you look very tired. I thought the
same thing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But not a good tired.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What’s a ‘good’ tired. Tired is tired.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Just wanted to see if you were on your
toes.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your sister said you don’t have a
family?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She thinks you should get married and have
children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except
she thinks you’re afraid of the responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Oh? Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because
you think you’re right about everything. And you’re the only one who can
do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like
none of the other police would know a crook from a… um… bag of
elbows.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I think that’s what she said.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good appetite.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Afternoon, gentlemen. I’d like you to meet
Samuel Lapp. We’d like a little help.</p>
<p><strong>kaman</strong>: There’s a Sgt. Carter on the phone for
you.</p>
<p><strong>kaman</strong>: And, Captain, don’t want to rush you, but I’m
gonna need these files back in a half hour. We got a lot of work to do
round here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why don’t you arrest that man? Are you
protecting him because policeman?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Listen, I’m the cop that polices the police.
I’m not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I’ll make an arrest
when I know everybody involved.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But why would they murder…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Because � somehow � they knew I was getting
close. Look, it’s narcotics… They make dope out of chemicals… they sell
it on the street for millions of dollars. They’ll do anything. And they
can get away with it because they’re cops.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m afraid. I’m afraid for Samuel. I want to
go home.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You’ll be safe. You don’t have to worry.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Look, they’re thinking as long as they keep
the killer out of Samuel’s way, we can’t make an I.D. There’s no way
they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I mean it. You will be safe.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn’t we feel
safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It was McElroy, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Last guy I would have figured. But he’s part
of it.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: I hope you don’t have any doubts about
that.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: If I did, I’d have kept my mouth shut… It
fits, Paul… Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago… Guess
who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere… he knows the
stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven’t figured out how to
process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a
pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Who else knows?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Just us.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Okay, what are you going to need to clean
it up</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: More people… Gotta pick up where Zenovich left
off. People from outside the department.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at
Treasury. I’ll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their
balls off for me. I’m counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: What’s your first move?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: A hot shower… I haven’t changed clothes in two
days.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Who else knows?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Just us.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey, buddy, what’s the score? Little too much
to drink?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a hospital!
Here; I’ll give you a hand.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No! No hospital!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to die in
the street, that’s his business!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at that
blood?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on, buddy… you’re gonna bleed to
death!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I told you, Henry!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman’s
name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now.
Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What the hell are you talking about? What’s
happening.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Nothing. I’m not going to be around for a
while. I’ll call you when I can.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Johnny, what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Listen to me � Schaeffer’s part of it. Maybe
at the top of it.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Yeah… I can put it all together when I get
back, ’Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Good. Take care of that woman’s name for me.
And watch your ass.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: It’s John. He says you have to leave now. He
says it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Put my car in the garage and close the
door.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: John, I don’t understand any of this.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You don’t know anything… borrowed your car.
Didn’t say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: John, why?…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Just do it!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where are you taking us now?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You couldn’t wait until morning?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You said we would be safe in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kinner un Narre…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Stay for awhile. Rest. I’ll make coffee and
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What about Samuel? Will you come back to
take him to trial?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: There isn’t going to be one.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Who was that man?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: His name is John Book.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Momma � look.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But John… why didn’t you go to a
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No, no doctor…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Gunshot… they’ll file reports… they’ll find
me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But �</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: And when they find me, they’ll find your
boy!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Is the English dead?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Looks dead…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Stoltzfus is coming.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: That has no place in this house.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It will go when he goes.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: That’s the English is it?</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: I feel… burning.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: This man should be treated in town. The
bullet entered there… and came out there. But there is the danger of
infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No, he must stay here.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Didn’t you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies?
Then the sheriff will come. They’ll say we broke their laws �</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’ll pray that he doesn’t die! But if he
does, then we’ll find a way so no one knows!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Rachel, this is a man’s life, we hold it in our
hands.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I
tell you that if he’s found here, the people who did this to him will
come for Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What else can we do?</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: Make a poultice… three parts milk, two
parts linseed oil… for the infection.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: Lapp, I’ll have to speak with the diener
on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: As you see fit, Stoltzfus.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s all right! You have got to lie
still.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes, much better…</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Looks like we’re going to need some help
from you folks down there.</p>
<p><strong>undersheriff</strong>: …want to help any way we can, Chief,
but you got to understand we’ve got upwards of seven thousand Amish over
here.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: I’ve got the woman’s name, Sheriff. Lapp.
Rachel Lapp. That should simplify your work.</p>
<p><strong>undersheriff</strong>: How about an address?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Ah… no.</p>
<p><strong>undersheriff</strong>: Maybe a road or route number?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>undersheriff</strong>: Problem is, Chief, ’bout every third
Amishman around here is named Lapp. That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
Chief, if the Amish have taken your man in, I wouldn’t want to hang from
a rope until you find him.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Thank you, Sheriff. It’s been an
education.</p>
<p><strong>tschantz</strong>: Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to your
credit.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: He was touched by God’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The leadership of our district… the diener.
Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and
see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first
day. I think he saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Can I have something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Does anybody know I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Only the elders.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: How long have I been here?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Two days.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But
I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: See. Anyway, you don’t have any clothes on.
And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: Rest, Mr. Book. That’s the ticket. And
drink my of my tea.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Tell him his tea stinks.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You tell him. When you’re able.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re all very happy that you’re going to
live, John Book. We didn’t quite know what we were going to do with you
if you died.</p>
<p><strong>hershberger</strong>: …but a gunshot wound. Very serious.</p>
<p><strong>tschantz</strong>: It is not the first time we have done
this. In the Englischer war of the revolution, old Elmer Miller’s
grandfather took in gunshot English soldiers. Saved them, too.</p>
<p><strong>erb</strong>: Still, he should be among his own people.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’ll leave as soon as he is able. He
already wants to go.</p>
<p><strong>hershberger</strong>: How long will that be, Stoltzfus?</p>
<p><strong>stoltzfus</strong>: A month. Maybe less. With God’s healing
love.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Then go away, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Elaine, I’ve come to apologize for Lt.
McElroy. He overstated the department’s position.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you
know � anybody who knows John � knows that’s a goddamn lie!</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Of course, Elaine. But as long as there’s
any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Better you should get off my front porch
before I get my mace!</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Elaine, I don’t want to have to take you
in for questioning. You’ve got his car, you were the last to see him
�</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: But… if you had to guess?</p>
<p><strong>mcelroy</strong>: She say where he is?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: I don’t think she knows.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: What about Carter?</p>
<p><strong>mcelroy</strong>: Tight. But I’m working on him.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Lean on him.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You ever handle a pistol like this,
Samuel?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: No pistol. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Tell you what � I’m going to let you handle
this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma.
I’ve got a feeling she wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: Okay, Mr. Book.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Call me John.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You don’t want to point that at people you
just started calling by their first name.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Samuel!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wait for me downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: John Book, I would appreciate it if, during
the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I
unloaded the gun -</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s not the gun. Don’t you understand… It’s
you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please, it has nothing to do with you
personally.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Put it up someplace Samuel can’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Friends?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: The gun � that gun of the hand � is for the
taking of human life. Would you kill another man? Eh?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What you take into your hands, you take into
your heart.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I would only kill a bad man.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Only a bad man. I see. And you know these bad
men on sight? You are able to look into their hearts and see this
badness?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I can see what they do.</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: I have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: And having seen, you would become one of them?
Don’t you see…? The hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the
head… leads the heart. The one goes into the other into the other into
the other… And you have changed, and gone amongst them…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: “Wherefore come out from among them and be ye
separate, saith the Lord!”</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: continuing from</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Enjoying your reading?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Very interesting. I’m learning a lot about
manure. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your shirt and jacket are still stained with
blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Your husband’s?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes. It’s good that someone can have the use
of them. Besides, in your clothes you’d stand out to strangers.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I should tell you these do not have buttons.
See? Hooks and eyes.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Something wrong with buttons?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Buttons are Hochmut.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Hochmut?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr.
He is not plain.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Anything against zippers?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You make fun of me. Like the tourists.
Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They
seem to think we are quaint.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Quaint? Can’t imagine why.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Where’s the nearest telephone?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley.
They’re Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in
the houses even.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No. I’d want a public phone.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well… the store at Saltzburg… But you won’t
be going to Saltzburg for a while.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’m going this morning.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But Stoltzfus said…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I know what he said.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You can go with Eli. He’s taking Samuel to
school. But you’ll have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Hurry up now, John Book!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: My… eh… gun?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: The… bullets?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh. The bullets.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Not much good without them.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Johnny! Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Never mind. I’m coming in to take care of
business. How hot am I?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Too hot. Don’t do it. Don’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Listen, Johnny, don’t do anything stupid.
You couldn’t get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put… Stay
in touch � I’ll let you know when maybe it makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I hear you. I’ll stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s more like it. Where are you at,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Where I’m at is maybe 1890.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Make that 1790.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: If you are well enough to do that thing, you
can do work for me.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sure, I’m sorry. Hope you don’t mind me
plugging in to your battery. Mine’s dead… How can I help? What can I
do?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Maybe milking.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Milking?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Cows. You know, cows?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’ve seen pictures.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Good, you start tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Veck oufl. Time for milking.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Good, firm twist and pull, eh? Right. Now you
try it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Didn’t you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had
your hands on a teat before?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Not one this big.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Careful, son �</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: That’s Luke. He doesn’t like strangers.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Good morning. Book, is it? You are the
Yankee they talk about?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I thought I was the English.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: English, Yankee. It’s the same. My name
is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler. You look plain, Book. Very plain.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: I came to see Rachel Lapp.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Try the house.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: You bet. you take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Pigs.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the
district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We had some lemonade and he left.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: A real fireball.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You know carpentry?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I did some carpentry summers when I was going
to school.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What else can you do?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I can whack people. I’m hell at whacking.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Whacking is not of much use on a farm.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Now hold on. There’s a lot of people who think
being a cop is a legitimate job.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sure it is.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Tonight I’ll let out those trousers for
you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Eat up, Book. What’s the matter with your
appetite?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Guess I’m not used to so much.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Not used to hard work. That’s what makes an
appetite.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a
fine policeman.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook’s
barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But… You may not be well enough.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’ll drink some more of Stoltzfus’ tea.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: When will you be going?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Not long… A few days.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You like it… Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No… You just stop �</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Next thing you know you’ll be off drinking
beer and racing motorcycles.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What is this? This Myusick?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’s not her fault. I �</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: How can this be? How can you do such a thing?
Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have done nothing against the ordnung.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our
house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of
English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more
blood. Now English music… and you are dancing to English music! And you
call this nothing?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have committed no sin.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does
not look… Don’t you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him.
Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you… shunned!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That is idle talk.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do
it… quick! Like that! And then… then I can not sit at table with you. I
can not take a thing from your hand. I… I can not go with you to
meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I am not a child.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You are acting like one!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I will be the judge of that.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No! They will be the judge of that! And so will
I… if you shame me!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You shame yourself.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You’d lie to protect him.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You admit you’re lying?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I admit I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You’re the first one he’ll contact.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s got my number.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: It’s funny. I know he’s hiding somewhere
with the Amish, I know it. Can you imagine John Book at a prayer
meeting? Our John Book?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Either you’re a member of the club or you
aren’t, Elton. Tell me what you know…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What I know, Paul, is… He’s going to take
you out…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we’re
going to be friends whether you like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: See… Sugar. You like sugar, don’t you for
Christ’s sake?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Won him over just like that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
Eli is ready to go to Zook’s.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Wait here ’til I find a gang you can work
with.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Book! Good to see you!</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Eli says you’re a carpenter, Book.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: No matter. Come with me. We can always
use a good carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Your hole is healed, then?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Good. Then you can go home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. yoder</strong>: Everyone has an idea about you and the
English.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: All of them charitable, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. yoder</strong>: Hardly any of them.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Nail it!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: We admire our work!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Hey, Sam…</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: …I want to say a thing.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What’s that, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Same to you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Last night.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: If… we’d made love, then, I couldn’t
leave.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Maybe I ought to learn to drive this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Pick myself up another useful skill.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Samuel, who is that?</p>
<p><strong>samuel</strong>: It looks like Hochstetler’s mare.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Uh oh, they’re leaving us behind.</p>
<p><strong>tourist lady</strong>: Could I… ah, you know?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Lady, if you take my picture, I’ll rip your
brassiere off and strangle you with it.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you a member of the family?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: What? I’m a friend of his.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter was
killed in the line of duty…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schaeffer</strong>: How are you, John?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. schaeffer</strong>: John Book!</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: I’ll take it in the study.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: You can hang up, dear.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn’t have
taken Elton out.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: How bad did Mac get you? We figured
pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’m fine. I’m going to live a long time.
That’s what I called to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Johnny �</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You might want to pass it along to Mac.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You’re out
there all alone… We’re getting close… real close… Maybe if you listen to
me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in �</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’ve already got something worked out. Be
seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do nothing. This happens from time to
time.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s not our way, John. We’ll have nothing
to do with violence! John!</p>
<p><strong>youth</strong>: Here comes another one!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: You’re making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>hochstetler</strong>: Everything is all right, John.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Pick up the hat.</p>
<p><strong>local man</strong>: Never seen anything like that in all my
years.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s from… Ohio… My cousin.</p>
<p><strong>local man</strong>: We’ll, them Ohio Amish sure must be
different. Our Lancaster brethren, they just don’t have that kind of
fight in them.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: John, lost control of himself. He… will be
repentant.</p>
<p><strong>local man</strong>: You’re Rachel Lapp, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes. Samuel! We’re going.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Kid’s nose is broken!</p>
<p><strong>local man</strong>: We’ll take him up the hospital. Good- day
to you, Mrs. Lapp. This ain’t good for the tourist trade, you know! You
tell that to your Ohio cousin!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You should not bother with that birdhouse.
If you’re leaving tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I’m leaving tonight. I’m going to need my
clothes. And my gun.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There was a time when I thought you might
have stayed.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: There was.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There was a time when I would have welcomed
it.</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I was being foolish?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking
about living this life.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re so sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Aren’t you? After today?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: but… her voice</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There is always a way! But you are such a… a
Glotzkopp you cannot see! You’d rather go back to that city! To nothing!
No woman! No children! No land!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Land! Are you crazy? I’m no Amishman and I’m
no farmer! I’m a cop. That’s what I know and that’s what I do!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What you do is take vengeance! Which is a
sin against heaven!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: That’s your way, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s God’s way!</p>
<p><strong>book</strong>: Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a
little help!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I could never love a man who was so…
little.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The other night… when you saw me after my
bath… I… I tried to look as I thought you would want a woman to look. I
am sorry… that I did not.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There… White Oak Road a couple of miles
before it ties into two-twenty- two. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: My man Holmes here put it together. Fine
officer, Chief. He spoke to the doctor at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked on
the phone. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>undersheriff</strong>: Sure you don’t want us to post some
backup units?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: If we need any help, we’ll give you a
shout. I’d like to slip in there quiet, then get out before we attract
any attention.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Maybe I’ll take a drive over that way.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Let ’em be. It’s their dirty laundry.</p>
<p><strong>mcelroy</strong>: Weird, man. No fuckin’ electricity. What do
you figure they plug all their shit into?</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: They don’t have any shit.</p>
<p><strong>schaeffer</strong>: Outside � Check out the rest of the
house.</p>
