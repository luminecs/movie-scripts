<p><strong>black</strong>: Some microphone feedback followed by:</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay, here we go… everybody watching? Our
screen goes WHITE as a POWERPOINT PRESENTATION BEGINS…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’d like to tell you all a little lov e
story… But the images n screen are JOURNALISTIC PHOTOS OF</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Whoops… wrong file… LAUGHTER O.S. and we
begin PULLING BACK TO REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>a reception hall - day</strong>: The lights are dim. We’re
looking at a blank, pull-down movie screen in a darkened ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hang on, I got this– Someone O.S. starts
CLINKING a fork against a wine glass. Is joined by others, and then we
HEAR calls of “Kiss! Kiss!”</p>
<p><strong>on a bride and groom</strong>: sitting at the main table, In
silhouette, seen from behind, lit only by the votives sprinkled along
the table: JOHN GROGAN and his bride of two hours, JENNY. In response to
the crowd, they kiss. Standing right by them is SEBASTIAN – tall, good
looking, rugged type –John’s best man.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Alright, now I’m ready– And now, on THE
PORTABLE SCREEN, Sebastian’S MONTAGE BEGINS: John with his Mom in front
of the college dorm, etc.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Here’s John, first week of college. Nice
hair, right?</p>
<p><strong>not</strong>: You think that feathering ’S easy? true. Takes
a very well p wrist action… CHUCKLES from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m just saying…</p>
<p><strong>several photos of john</strong>: Throughout college…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Was John a star athlete? A shot of him
fumbling a frisbee,</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Umm, no. Was he a ladies man? With
mid-eighties hair, bad glasses.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>him</strong>: What he was, was John, and we loved for it.</p>
<p><strong>an</strong>: Taken r. Sebastian. up l ^a n�ghte Sebastian
turns the camera on himself, holds Sharpie pen, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And he was always looked after by his
guardian angel and best friend.</p>
<p>****: People are staring at me - is my fly down?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No, no, it’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All right, enough with the - - all right,
what? What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh, wait, there’s something on your
forehead. John brushes it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You got it. Leaf or something.</p>
<p>****: A leaf. On my forehead.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah, it musta had some sap on it. They
pass a cluster of CO EDS who laugh at John.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And then there’s Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>4 photos of jenny</strong>: Looking, indeed, very cool, very
put together.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Studious, hard-working, quiet.</p>
<p><strong>photos of a wilder jenny</strong>: In short-shorts, wet
T-shirt, throwing water balloons at a frat house. Standing on an empty
keg of beer, rolling it like it’s a log.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, okay, sometimes not so quiet.</p>
<p><strong>video of jenny</strong>: Ordering a bunch of guys around,
telling who to go where, as the camera ZOOMS OUT, we see they’re playing
touch football - except she tackles. Hard. And then does a little
victory dance over the fallen. Jenny’s the captain, in charge…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay, maybe a little high-spirited, maybe
voted Miss Kegger once or twice too often on Fraternity ROW, but a good
girl underneath it all. Now could they not fall in love?</p>
<p><strong>two photos juxtaposed</strong>: One of John “flexing” beside
a lake, another of Jenny screaming at a football game with a beer in her
hand.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Now, in any decent love story, you gotta
have the great first meeting.</p>
<p>****: All right, I’m zooming in. Whoa. Not a flosser.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Turn it off. And as he REACHES for it - WHAM’.
He hits another car! The camera goes flying. Fumbles. SCREAMS.
YELLS.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: They’re okay! They’re getting out.
Sebastian manages to right the CAMERA and unsteadily films John getting
out of the car, heading towards the car he hit. The passenger door opens
and Jenny comes out. She’s covered in frosting and the remains of a
birthday cake which she was carrying in her lap. The damaged car is full
of balloons.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you a complete idiot?!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And so one of the truly great love
affairs of the late eighties began. In the home video, Jenny advances on
John, hurls the rest of the cake at him, starts flailing at him with her
hands.</p>
<p><strong>5 continued:</strong>: The driver of the car, another co-ed,
gets out and yells at CAMERA .</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Brought together by their love of fast
cars, spirited Baskin- Robbins Dreamy Drizzle Ice Cream cake.</p>
<p><strong>6 different photos now 6</strong>: John and Jenny both at
typewriters.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: From there, they went on to work together
at the school newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>shot of jenny in the newspaper office</strong>: Shot of Jenny
standing at the head of a table full of reporters.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Although, technically, they didn’t work
together so much as John worked for Jenny who was the editor of said
paper…</p>
<p><strong>shot of jenny and john kissing</strong>: In her office,
through the semi-closed Venetian blinds.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Let’s just say there were some flagrant
workplace violations.</p>
<p><strong>camera</strong>: the words “NEED JOB” are spelled out in
white adhesive tape.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The point is their love grew, blah blah
blah… And that love continues tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And now, please join me in raising a
glass to my future neighbors down in Florida, and to the dawn of both a
marriage end a brilliant journalistic team, the new Woodward and
Bernstein, this time with sex. Bad sex, probably, but - anyway: to John
and Jenny Grogan.</p>
<p><strong>and now push in on john and jenny</strong>: She’s had an
ffect on He’s not so much break applause.e him. They kiss as</p>
<p><strong>9 snow falling</strong>: PULL BACK TO REVEAL we’re looking
out a window.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: MmzmII</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How do I get vou?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m serious. In what world does a guy like me
get someone like you?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you kidding? You’re part of the plan.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The plan.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Step one. Meet an incredibly sweet, smart,
sexy guy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Done. Step two?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marry him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Check. Step three? She smiles, puts her face
right up to his…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Now that one’s a surprise… They kiss and as
we push past them, into the snowy window, we END CREDITS and…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You know you got this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m John Grogan.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Wrong. You’re John Friggin Grogan who’s about
to get a job. She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Um, okay, see now I don’t wanna get out of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: i really just wanna sit here and make out with
you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: –Get out of the car. He nods, starts to get
out, then pauses.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who am i again?</p>
<p>****: Kidding.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Sebastian says you won some award?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, sir, I got a Mitchy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like a Pulitzer, but for western Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: A Mitchy. Min-hmm. So, tell me, why did you
want to leave the estimable -</p>
<p>****: - Kalamazoo Gazette?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were in
college together, and he was always talking about South Florida… mostly
about the women of South Florida, but anyway, after my wife and I got
married we thought it might be nice to come</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: For the women?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh, no– for the… the… uh…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: For the work?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. That.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Your wife’s Jenny Havens, right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, Jenny Grogan now–</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: She take the job at the Post?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I tried to get her over her</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Damn fine writer.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: What’s the matter, the Post didn’t want Yo
m?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, she does features. I’m more a straight
news writer. This is a better paper for that.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Straight news writer, huh. Meaning you think
you’re a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Meaning I know I am.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: And the six other sweaty-palmed college grads
I’m interviewing today, you think you’re better than them?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, sir. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m not. But
I do know that I always seem to surprise myself. Ten years ago, I was
doing bong hits and playing Donkey Kong, never dreamed I’d get into
college. But I did, and I graduated with honors. Two years ago, my
buddies told me that the most Jenny Havens would ever say to me was,
You’re sweet, but I don’t like you in that way.. But she did like me in
that way– and my buddies can suck it because I married her. I certainly
never thought I’d win some award with a dumbass name–</p>
<p>****: The “Mitchy.”</p>
<p>****: Exactly sir. But i surprised myself and I won it. And if you
give me the chance, I’m pretty sure I’ll surprise you, too. Arnie
considers him a moment.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: That’s quite a speech, son. You rehearse
that, or come up with it on the fly?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Elevator, on the way up.</p>
<p>****: How’d I do? Arnie just looks back at him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s got me on a little thing they like to
call… Desert Storm–</p>
<p><strong>you got the job!</strong>: She gets out of the car and the
two embrace right there on the street. She takes out her notebook,
crosses something off on her “list.”</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: okay… “Jobs.” Done.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what’s next? Lunch?</p>
<p>****: House.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You like the quote about the speed bumps?</p>
<p>****: “If they save even one life–”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: -“it would be worth it. And with that, Janet
Dickerson’s mother’s eyes filled with tears.”</p>
<p>****: That one just felt exactly right, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, no, it’s good. What happened to the
Desert Storm piece?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s it. The injured girl’s dad’s in Kuwait.
What, that’s not in there?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Uhhhh… they must’ve cut it… And they kinda
misspelled your name. John Egan…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What– you’re kidding– He reaches for the
paper, but she holds it away.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Forget it. It’s good, John. It’s got facts,
some color. It’s a solid piece.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks. I’m almost done with yours. This idea
of voting machines sounds</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well, except on the other page I talk about
what could happen– He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, it continues… An awkward moment as he now
searches for the new page, has to fold back the paper. No escaping the
fact that ie article is longer and more important than his. She finally
gets up…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You know what? The rest is just okay, really
pretty boring…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, I’m enjoying it… He tortures himself
and keeps reading. She moves to the sink, starts to rinse out her
cup…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow, they really gave you a lot of space,
didn’t they? She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT
on the sill.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Damn. I killed another one. How am I ever
going to take care of a kid, I can’t even keep a plant alive? John looks
up from the paper. “Kid?” She comes gives him a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’ll see you later, Mr. Gorgan. She headsout,
leaving John staring terrified at the plant.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: A kid, huh…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well, what’d you expect? You bought a
house, man. A house with a mare room…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s wrong with a spare room?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: It’s empty, John. That’s what’s wrong
with it. And you know what else is empty? Her womb.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m starting to worry that we’re already at
Step Six.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know Jenny, she’s got her whole life
organized and planned out… Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back
to John.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You want my advice? Get her a PuPPY•</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A puppy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Something other than you she has to take
care of. You have a kid, you’re a dad. You’re not you anymore. You have
a dog, you’re a master. You’re still a guy. With a life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And a dog…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Whatever, man. You’re still free. You’ve
stopped the clock.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What clock?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay… you know in movies when there’s,
like, a bomb and it’s ticking down, ten seconds left, and there’s some
guy with a wire cutter going, “red wire… blue wire… which one do I cut?”
And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and SNIP. Silence. The
world is saved.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay… is the bomb strapped to a dog… because
I’m not sure I’m</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: John, you buy this dog, you’re saving
your world. Because that ticking you hear, is not a bomb, it’s her
biological clock. John looks back at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>arnie .</strong>: Sebastian! They both turn as Arnie sticks
his head out of his office.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Your travel’s approved. Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: In motion.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Colombia. I got a guy down there, says he
can put me next to Pablo Escobar– I’m doing this piece, I follow a
single coca leaf from Colombia, to the streets of Miami.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you and I once talked about doing
something like that. We were gonna call it, “From Plant to Pusher.”
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p>****: –there was another fire at the county dump. Some kinda methane
leak.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Actually, it’s Grogan–</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I want two paragraphs for the blotter.</p>
<p><strong>18 continued:</strong>: John nods, looks off at Sebastian who
now sits down at his cluttered desk, pulls a DUFFLE BAG from under his
desk. John watches with envy as Sebastian starts stuffing cameras,
recorders, a bowie knife, into the duffle…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So uh, what kind of puppy? Sebastian looks up
at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: To, y’know, cut the wire.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Get her a lab. They’re supposed to be
just like little kids. But easier to train.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This isn’t the ihop…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A little surprise first…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Sorry about the smell.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: When can I look?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just hang on… Lori opens a door to a laundry
room.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Now. Jenny opens her eyes and sees a
utility room. Nine yellow yipping Lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard
box towards John and Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh my God… they’re adorable…</p>
<p>****: Wait a minute, my birthday’s a month from now.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: That’s okay, they can’t leave for another
three weeks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, we never even talked about this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re right. Let’s go. He’s kidding. And
besides, Jenny’s already on the floor, letting the puppies climb all
over her.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Look at you guys…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: I got papers on the mom and the dad, so you
can register these.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is the father here too?</p>
<p>****: Oh, yeah, somewhere. Anyway, girls are $400, boys are $375.
Except this little guy here.</p>
<p><strong>and</strong>: She points to one male puppy, who is clearly
the goofiest most excited.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You can have him for $325.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How sweet. He’s on clearance…</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Well, he’s a little too stocky for the breed,
so he probably won’t show.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s so sweet…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He likes you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, I don’t know if I’m ready for a</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You have to wait three weeks for the litter to
get weaned, before you can bring ’em home anyway.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Plenty of time to get ready.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I won’t even be here. I’m gonna be with my
sister then…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No problem. I can take him. Be good bonding
time. Get him all trained in time for you to come home. A chuckle from
Lori.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s give ’em all the scare test.</p>
<p>****: The what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I hear the best dog in the litter is the one
who doesn’t spook easily. They turn out to be the most people-
centered.</p>
<p>****: Uh, how are you gonna– John turns away, and then suddenly turns
back with a loud step and a “BOO”! All of the puppies scatter. Lily
barks. But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail
wagging.</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: Well, that’s your guy. John scoops him up.
Clearance Puppy licks his face. John hands him to Jenny. She lets him
lick her face…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I would’ve picked you anyway–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Meant to be. He watches her cuddle the puppy
and knows he’s done the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You really sure about this? I mean, a puppy’s
a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How hard could it be? We hear A COMMOTION is
coming from the woods, something crashing through the brush, breathing
heavily. They both freeze as the sound comes their way.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s that? Just then they are nearly
knocked off their feet by a huge, rampaging Labrador, soaking wet,
covered with mud and burrs. It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed
look in its eye. It jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels
past Lori into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it goes.
A beat.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think we just met the dad.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Call me as soon as you get him home. Oh, hey,
we need a name.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How ’bout I just call him “Clearance Puppy”
until you get back. I only hope he doesn’t say his first word without
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa! He got big… This is the right one,
right?</p>
<p><strong>lori</strong>: You should see him pack away the puppy
chow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, what if I run into any problems?</p>
<p>****: Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are final, though. Not just for
him. I tell that to everyone.</p>
<p>****: You want help getting him in the car?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, that’s okay, I’ll just… John opens the
door, indicates that Marley should jump in. Instead, the puppy runs
around the car, barking, jumping up on the bumpers. John finally catches
him, lifts him up, puts him on the front passenger seat atop some
towels.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p>****: Well, anyway, thanks for– But Lori’s already inside her house,
the door closed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey… guy. The dog just stares at him
quizzically. Uncomfortable alone with the dog, John turns on the radio.
BOB MARLEY plays and the puppy THUMPS HIS TAIL.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You like Bob Marley? The dog THUMPS HIS TAIL
AGAIN. John turns up the music. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP faster this
time.</p>
<p><strong>good boy–</strong>: Bob? Marley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley. Okay– Marley. Cool. But now the pup
starts wriggling towards John, John tries to put him back…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No– stay boy… stay. Okay, not really safe,
bud– Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console. He
remains like this, his tail thumping… John gives up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Alright, fine, but just this time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is our house… The dog immediately pees on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And now it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This one’s water. This one’s food.</p>
<p><strong>26 continued: 26</strong>: Marley starts pawing the food
bag.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: C’mon, man, you’ve already had kibble and half
a seat belt. All right. Special treat. But just today… He opens the bag
and Marley tackles it. Several cupfuls spill onto the floor. John goes
to the pantry to get the dustpan and brush. When he returns, he finds
Marley has eaten the food in the bowl AND every last scrap of spilled
food. And now he’s squatting to pee again…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, no! He picks up the puppy and rushes
him outside.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, now. Pee. He motions with his
zipper.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: C’mon, man, do your thing. Alright, I’m gonna
show you this one time… From behind, we see John peeing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Except you gotta lift your leg. See, this is
how you guys do it… Marley looks at him, squats and pees…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Or you could do it like that. Just not in
front of other guy dogs.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley. I like that…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you sure? Because it can be temporary…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No, it’s good.</p>
<p>****: He must be exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yeah, he’s pooped. Marley lets out a
SQUEAK as he tugs at a couch cushion…</p>
<p>****: Oh, he sounds so sweet!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah… He’s very cute. Just like a little kid
only furrier.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Put the phone by his ear… John chases after
the dog who burrows under the couch, his tail sticking out so that John
can’t get him…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh, okay, he’s listening. John just holds the
phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Marley! Who’s my good boy?! Mommy can’t
wait to meet you…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Anyway, don’t worry, he’s doing great. Like
he’s lived here his whole life. All eight weeks of it. And you know what
else? I think he’s going to be pretty easy to train. I mean, he’s
curious which means he’s smart, right?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Of course he is. I can’t wait to see him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just him?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Jealous?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not the one sleeping in a box.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I love you. I’ll see you Friday.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll see you in the morning, okay? Marley
looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aw, come on, don’t. You’ll be fine, alright.
And tomorrow, we’re gonna tear it up. I’m thinking kibble, park, chew
toy, the whole nine yards. Okay? we good? Marley doesn’t-look so good,
looks kind of sad. John turns and gets out of there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal! He listens a
beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So I’m there in this cave, right?
Blindfolded. And I can feel the machine guns, there’s like nine of ’em
around me… and they tie me to a chair and then Escobar comes in and
says– are you ready?</p>
<p>****: I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I think you captured his
narcissism just right.</p>
<p>****: Can you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some of it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Man, I wish you could’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, but then I wouldn’t have been able to do
the piece on the water main break at the library. That would have
sucked.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Your time will come, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll drink to that– They toast with their
beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at his watch.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You gotta be somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. No, it’s the puppy. It’s his first</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You got adoc?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley. A little lab. Like you said. Remember?
The bomb…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh, right. Smart move. You’ll see. You’ve
just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two
years.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Millers got robbed again. And that mutt of
yours hasn’t shut up since you left. John looks towards the garage where
we hear WHIMPERING.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No no… I just wanted you to know I’m back. The
puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the box and pets
him…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay? Yeah, I
know, good to see you, too. But I’m just inside the house, I’ll see you
in the morning. Big day tomorrow. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just this one time. John climbs into bed,
shuts off the light. Marley whimpers and John rolls onto his stomach,
reaches into the box and strokes his back, the puppy lays down, still
whimpers…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, come on…</p>
<p>****: Hey. Remember this? One love, one heart…</p>
<p>****: Let’s get together and feel alright… John nods off, one arm
hanging over the side of the bed into the box, his hand resting on
Marley’s back as the puppy now snoozes peacefully and we then…</p>
<p><strong>40 fade in: close-up of marley’s face 40</strong>: Tail
rising in the b.g., wagging.</p>
<p><strong>40 continued:</strong>: As John opens his eyes to see Marley
snuggled up against his face. Marley’s eyes looking into his. John
reaches over the puppy and shuts off the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She comes home today. Hung over, he sits up,
looks around the messy room, half due to John’s bachelor housekeeping
habits, half due to Marley. Not only has everything has been chewed, but
some time during the night Marley discovered how much fun toilet paper
is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We should probably clean up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh. It’s already completely gnawed up. John
looks at Marley who emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper, rams right
into the screen door, bounces back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, it’s a screen, you’re not gonna</p>
<p><strong>get through–</strong>: Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few
steps, gets a head of steam, then rams into it again, this time goes
right through it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: –there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be back in an hour. Be good.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How’s my puppy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m okay. A little tired, but</p>
<p><strong>otherwise–</strong>: She nudges him. He gives her another
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley! She takes off for the side door of
the garage.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh my God. It’s a mess. It’s almost
incredible that it’s all due to a single puppy. The box is in shreds; so
are the blankets. A puddle of urine on the floor. A large piece of dry
wall has been chewed off near the big garage door. The garbage cans are
overturned. Marley is whimpering in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow. Okay, this is not how I left it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How long has he been in here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: An hour, at the most. Jeez… he Alg drywall.
That’s just not right.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Look. He’s shaking– Another bit of THUNDER
and the puppy whimpers louder.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm? He licks
her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the Pluto stuffed animal. She
hugs him…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Look at us. She looks up at John and smiles.
He returns the smile. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley, no! Jenny chases him into the
kitchen, past John who holds up the newspaper…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He gave me an extra paragraph… Marley bursts
through the back screen door…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, no! John chases him across the
backyard. Marley goes under the fence and John starts to go over
into…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, no! They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing
on his patio watching.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi, Tom– Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Happy Thanksgiving… Marley goes through a
hedge and out onto…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley, no!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t understand, why me?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I’m in a bind, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But I’m a reporter, not a columnist.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: It’s a step up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, but it’s a step away from what I wanna
do.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: It’s also better pay, you set your own hours,
pick your own topics…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: and it’s only temporary, just until I find
someone permanent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What happened to Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: You may have noticed that in every other
column, he went on about The Pie Palace?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I really haven’t read his–</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Turns out he’s been getting free meals in
exchange for mentioning the joint. It’s also why he became such a fat
ass. John nods. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Anyway, it’s twice a week. And like I said,
it’s only until I can find someone else to replace him. Then you’re back
on, uh… whatever beat you were on.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Your dog’s funny.</p>
<p>****: Uh, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He tried to eat one of our tires.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little known
fact, helps the digestive tract…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Right. Along with the occasional black
Converse high top which I’d still love to get back by the way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: ’Preciate that.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I think he dislocated my shoulder. He doesn’t
heel– hell, he doesn’t even walk, he sprints, and I had to pull him off
three dogs…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Poodle?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, among others. There was a Yorkie, a
Dalmatian and a bichon frise that may never be right again. What’re you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Arnie gave me a column.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re kidding? Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yeah, it’s a big honor. I get to write
about zoning laws and yard sales.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I bet you make something out of it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s only temporary until he finds someone
else. I’m just trying to get something down for Tuesday. She gives him a
kiss, starts out of the room</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’ll think of something. And John, I’m
serious abut Marley. He wreaks havoc everywhere he goes. We gotta do
something…</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Incorrigible? I don’t believe in that.
All dogs want to learn. But they can’t when their owners are
weak-willed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m very strong-willed.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: And where is your animal?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s over there. With my wife. He was a little
excited. He usually needs a little time to calm down. Ms. Kornblut looks
at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: I see. He calls the shots. Which of
you will be the trainer?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: we thought we both would, since we want him
to listen to both of us at home -</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: A dog can only answer to one master.
Which one of you has the most natural authority in your own
relationship?</p>
<p>****: I’ll watch.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: I thought so. We begin.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Sit!</p>
<p><strong>56 continued:</strong>: The students order their dogs to sit,
and most of them do. The ones that don’t require only a little effort to
get the idea. Whereas: Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps
up on her and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to tug him into
place and he grabs the leash in his teeth, shaking it playfully.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: That, class, is an example of a dog
that has been foolishly allowed to believe he is the alpha male of his
pack. And therefore he cannot be a happy animal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, he looks really bummed. Kornblut hears
him, death stares John.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: You. Joker. Rotate in. John looks at
Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to take.</p>
<p><strong>57 cut to: a heavy choke chain 57</strong>: As Ms. Kornblut
demonstrates on her wrist.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: The choke chain. When your animal
walks properly by your side, there’ll be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
around his neck like a noose and loosens as soon as he stops
pulling.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does it hurt them?</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Well, it’s not called a hug chain. But
they learn to like it. Go on, collar your dogs. Everyone else quickly,
easily gets the choke chain around their dogs’ necks. Of course.
Meanwhile: John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley’s
neck. Marley, liking its shiny jingling, tries to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>57 continued: 57</strong>: Much tussling, and John finally
gets it around Marley’s neck - but Marley still manages to grab it in
his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He likes it.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: That’s because he’s eating it… Get it
out of his mouth. Class? Give your dogs the sit command. All the dogs
sit; John forces Marley’s butt down.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: The leash is held in two places. Loop
around your right hand, left hand at waist level. Dog always on your
left, of course.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That means us, pal. He rearranges Marley so
he’s on John’s left.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Now, when you give the heel command,
step off with your left foot - I don’t want to see any right foot first
steppers - and walk. If your dog gets ahead, administer a correction by
forcefully bring your left hand down and towards the right, and he’ll
respond. Shall we? One, two, three - now! Just as the dogs and owners
prepare to step off, Marley lurches ahead of the pack…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, heel! Marley takes off like a fighter
jet, dragging John behind.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Correct him! John gives a mighty yank
on the leash. Marley coughs, hesitates. John loosens the leash - and
Marley explodes forward again. John yanks, Marley stops, John releases,
Marley explodes forward.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Rein in that dog! All right, everyone,
line up again. Demonstration. Mr. Grogan? Pay attention. She takes the
leash from John and efficiently guides him into line with the other
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: It’s a simple question of confidence
in one’s own authority. Shall I demonstrate a simple walk?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
obey his leader. Marley? Heel. And she steps off confidently - but
Marley is a bit more confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he
falls back on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park. She manages to
turn Marley around, and the whole process begins again as they make
their way back to the line. Her face is flushed with embarrassment,
anger, and exertion, but Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It’s
like a walking tug-of-war. With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to
return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts
humping her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down, and
then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee. John and Jenny
rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps up Mrs. Kornblut. She’s
livid.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: That’s it! He’s out!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He usually just does this with poodles. Maybe
it’s the hair.</p>
<p><strong>ms. kornblut</strong>: He’s a bad influence on the others.
Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes hold in a group - he has to
go!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, that was fun. Congratulations, Marley.
You flunked obedience school.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You know, John, there is something else we
can do–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, I’m not doing that to him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s painless. And he’ll be a lot more
comfortable. It’ll calm him down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you know why he’ll be calmer? Because
he’ll have nothing to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’re you talking about? There are plenty
of other things that’ll make him</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s where you’re wrong. Trust me, Jen: I
know. I’m a guy. And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only
thing we really look forward to is sex. Runner up: the possibility of
sex.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, Please. Every book says he’ll live</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’ll just feel longer.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, he’s out of control. It’s the right
thing to do. John sighs, looks at Marley who’s now humping the stuffed
“goofy” that Jenny gave him as a puppy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It won’t be so bad, buddy. You’ll see. Sex is
overrated. Marley looks-at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, I’m lying, and I think you know that… so
maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it. Jenny cuts him a
look. He lowers his voice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Poor son-of-a-bitch. A guilty John cracks the
window just a bit and Marley begins listing to starboard, leaning
against John to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto
John’s lap…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here… Marley now
jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to catch the fresh
air</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Least I can do. John lowers the window and
Marley gets his whole snout out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here you go… John lowers the window again and
now Marley sticks his whole head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue
hanging out like he’s drunk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s so happy. He has no idea what’s about to
happen to him. Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half
open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s fine. He just wants a little</p>
<p><strong>fresh–</strong>: Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out
the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, grab him! Before John can do anything,
Marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving
car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s onto our evil plan, and he’s making a
break for it! But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing
for a foothold…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh, little help here… John’s stuck. He can’t
pull the dog back in the window and he can’t open the door. He can’t let
go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them.
John hangs on for dear life…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I got him!</p>
<p>****: What are you looking at?! He’s losing his balls today! Cut the
guy some slack!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Strip mall get approved?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Riveting planning commission vote.
Knuckle-biter. 8 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You up for a beer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t, I gotta finish the column. Maybe
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Can’t, I’ll be in L.A. Part of that drug
piece I’m doing–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. Another time then. John watches him
move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big smile as he passes. John
sits there another moment, looks at his desk. A photo of him and Jenny.
One of Marley with a flip flop in his mouth. John chuckles to himself,
then deletes the column, starts typing a new one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m really sorry, I’ll go back and do the
zoning piece–</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: The hell you sorry for? It’s hilarious. John
sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is, Arnie’s face doesn’t
say “hilarious,” but…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I loved it. Getting kicked out of obedience
school, the humping, the “Great Escape,” all of it. Hysterical. Again,
Arnie’s face remains dead serious as he passes the paper back to
John.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Run it. As is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you, sir. John starts out of the
office.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Hey, Gorgan…</p>
<p>****: Tell him not to feel bad. Sooner or later, we all lose our
balls.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be sure to pass that on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: To two years.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That was fast.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good, though, right?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Really good. He lifts out of his chair and
kisses her, a long one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So. What’s next?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I was thinking desert.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I mean on your list.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My list?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ed, Remember, when we first got marri you had
this whole checklist, with like the game plan.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what came next?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Let’s see… a new car maybe?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: afterthat? We can do that. What was</p>
<p>****: You sure you wanna know?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: well, it was between a new roof and a baby.
He studies her for a long moment, then…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can probably live with a few leaks.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Really? Because a leak can turn into
something bigger… and that can be a big responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I was just thinking that we might want
everything fixed before we went to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, we’ve already fixed Marley.
Literally.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You’re serious about this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think so. JENNY t an And you know we’re not
talking abou actual roof here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I got that. She looks back at him,
finally nods. They are. Then..</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have a baby,
we should stop trying to not have one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If I’m following you correctly – and I think I
am – this is the part where we go home and get it on, right?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Did you eat some kibble?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? And now they part and we see MARLEY’S
HUGE FACE RESTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED, watching, panting up a
storm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley– get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>know</strong>: it’s fine, he’s a dog, he doesn’t what he’s
looking at.</p>
<p><strong>resents</strong>: Oh, he knows, and trust me, he the hell out
of me right now. Go on, Marley! Get out! But Marley jumps up on the bed,
tries to climb on both of</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley! And now they both start laughing as
the dog tries to lick their faces…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: This is even funnier than the last one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: You’re good, Gorgan. And not just the dog
stuff. The piece on the women of Boca last week. What’d you call
them?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Boccahontis.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Hilarious. John nods, starts for the
door…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Is it true what you wrote? You and the wife
are trying to have a kid?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, we’re not really trying.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: How’s that work?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Are you having sex?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: ant? With the intention of getting pregn</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: i guess.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Congratulations. You’re trying. John just
stands there. Arnie looks back at him.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I assume you’ve thought this through?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I mean…</p>
<p>****: .yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Grogan.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I just thought I’d let you know that I’m
ovulating.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just in case you wanted to come home.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Like right now.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Daddy! And now, another KID,
4-year-old girl, jumps up in and out of frame…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I wanna push the button!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Daddy can’t lift you right now–</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You said I could push the button!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Alright, okay, I’ll just– He tries to pick
her up without leaning over…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ow! You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Okay, you know what? Never mind, no button!
A very uncomfortable John now steps forward…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want me to give her a hand?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh– would you mind? John lifts the girl up
to the panel. She runs her hands, from top to button, down the panel,
pressing every single button.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sarah! Goddammit–</p>
<p><strong>70 continued:</strong>: And now the little girl starts
bawling in concert with the baby, while a trapped John backs up into the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi. John watches the young couple go, arms
around each other.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, boy.</p>
<p>****: Jenny?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Out in a sec! John stands there, Marley
looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So. This is us not trying. The bathroom door
opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky two-piece thing…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, Sailor. She walks into the bedroom. John
looks back at Marley as he follows her into the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Catch you later, buddy. And closes the door on
the dog.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So the puppy wasn’t enough?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, technically, we’re not trying. But you
know Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: But things are good right now, just as
they are, right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, things are really good.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So why change it up with a kid? I mean,
have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The bomb, right?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes. The bomb. And just so we’re clear,
the countdown sequence has been reactivated. By you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, it’s been a few months and nothing’s
happened. Which actually makes me wonder if–</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Mr. Grogan? The BARTENDER sets a PHONE
down in front of John.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Phone call. I loved that thing you did on
your dog watching you and your wife have sex? Really funny stuff…</p>
<p>****: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Seriously, man, your stuff is
classic.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, it’s just temporary, but thanks. John
cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I just wanted to let you know that there’s a
naked blonde in your bed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. Why don’t you two get started and I’ll be
there as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Very funny. Can you come home? I’ll make it
worth your while.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. Alright then. I’ll see what I can do. He
hangs up. Looks at Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh, I’m sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I forgot,
I had this thing, I gotta deal</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: She’s calling you home, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. See you later. John starts out of the
bar. Sebastian calls after him.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Tick tick tick!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, this baby thing. I been thinking
maybe we should take a break. You know? Obviously, it’s not happening.
Maybe that’s nature’s way of saying it’s not good timing. No sound from
Jenny. He struggles on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe this is a sign that we’re not ready for
this. I mean, have we really thought this through? Because–</p>
<p><strong>behind</strong>: He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom
door. From her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Great. Wow, that’s… great.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: But you just said</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, no, I mean– okay, this is definitely
awkward now, but…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You wanna start over?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: By all means.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you. Okay, well… I gotta be honest, I’m
a little panicked.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you panicking because I’m pregnant… or
because you’re afraid I’m going to hit you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Both. It’s a twofer thing.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. No. Not at all. Yeah, yeah I’m pretty
scared.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Me, too. But we’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p>****: Look at me… He looks at her. She smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p>****: I believe you. He looks at her stomach, kisses her there…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s probably the last one about Marley for
a while. But in about nine months, I’m gonna have a new subject, might
be just as fun. Jenny’s pregnant.</p>
<p>****: I’m very happy for you. Have you bought her a present?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: A gift, John. She’s carrying a child. Your
child. Don’t you think that’s worth something?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: You don’t wanna make the mistake I did.
Listen to me. There’s gonna come a time, she’s fat, she’s nauseous, her
ankles are swollen, and she’s gonna look at you, and this is what that
look will mean: “You bastard. You did this to me. You dick, you ruined
me.” But then…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: she’s gonna remember that little ring,
bracelet, anklet, whatever, that you bought her, and she’s gonna feel
better. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Can I just–</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Go ahead. There’s a jeweler on the corner.
Mention my name.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, John, it’s beautiful… She sets it down on
the coffee table, then moves close to him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Thank you… She kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was just thinking about you when I walked by
the store and saw it in the window…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: That is so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put it on… She turns back to the coffee table
and looks around…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Where’d it go? It was right here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You just put it down. It can’t have</p>
<p><strong>just disappeared–</strong>: And then he stops. Looks off. So
does Jenny…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh God… Marley stands a few feet away,
looking strangely gleeful. A glint of Gold in the moonlight dangles from
his mouth. They both get up, start to move towards him…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey, boy. Come here. Look what I got for
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t want any trouble…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, here’s a little something– treat.
Marley She reaches into her pocket for an moves looks at her. Is this a
trick? He considers. Then he closer. John tiptoes up behind him, ever so
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I just want to give you a treat and a big
kiss. That’s a boy… Inch by inch, Marley approaches her. But then,
behind Marley, John knocks against a table. Marley freezes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He made me! Go! Jenny lurches for Marley,
going for his collar, and John leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters
away. Ah, a game! He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air
and his puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver
Marley back into Jenny. Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries
open his mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Dr. Jay’s sending over a laxative.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes.</p>
<p>****: You know, years ago, when I pictured my life, somehow standing
in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride’s swallowed
and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn’t spring to mind.</p>
<p>****: Aha! Jackpot!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I think it’s shinier than before.
Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only threw up
eight times.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My hero.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: How’s that crazy dog of yours? I’m a big
fan.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The heartbeat’ll be very fast, like a little
train. That’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not that I
care. He can be any sex he wants. Male, female, we don’t care.
Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Shhhhh… hang on… She listens for a moment
with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Sometimes you,can’t hear it, depending on how
the baby is lying.- You’re ten weeks, right?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Next Monday, yes.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Might be a little early for that. Let’s go
right to the sonogram. Did you bring your blank tape?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ready to roll.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Let’s get a good picture first. It’ll be on
the monitor there. The Nurse begins running the instrument around
Jenny’s stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen.</p>
<p>****: Hmmm. This one doesn’t seem to be picking up anything. Excuse
me, I’ll be just a minute… She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each
other, but inside each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to
expand. We wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then… smiles
down at DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sherman</strong>: Hi, guys. Let’s have a look at your
baby, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sherman</strong>: All right, there we go. Good. Now, look
over there. Much better resolution, right? Jenny and John, holding
hands, look at the computer screen. They see a sac, which, with a click
of the mouse, Dr. Sherman expands and expands. But it’s empty. Jenny
tries to smile.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Is there anything in there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. sherman</strong>: Not what you’d expect to see at ten
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not quite ten weeks. Dr. Sherman looks at
them directly. Kindly:</p>
<p><strong>dr. sherman</strong>: Jenny, I’m sorry, but there’s no
heartbeat. John and Jenny are still, silent.</p>
<p><strong>dr. sherman</strong>: One in six pregnancies ends this way.
it just happens sometimes, that’s all. I’m very sorry. But you’re young
and healthy and in a couple of months, you can try again.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you come by my office on your way out and we can talk
some more. He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He tries
to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: How could this happen? What’d I do wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You didn’t do anything–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I must have. Otherwise, how could I lose
it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny, it’s not something you have any control
over. It’s like the doctor said, it just happens–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not to me… I did something wrong. I know it…
I did something wrong. I’m sorry, John…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t say that–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: But I am– I’m sorry–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t need sorry. You didn’t do anything!
She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there, staring at the
videotape in his hands. Outside in the hall, the door to another
examining room opens and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly.
Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made even
worse.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In a couple of months, we can try again. Okay?
Jenny just looks out the window.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want some tea?</p>
<p>****: Hey, you know what I was thinking? We still have those tickets
from your parents for the honeymoon in Ireland. We can finally do
that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Take some time off. It’ll be fun, clear our
heads, right?</p>
<p>****: Jenny? No answer. He goes into the living room and stops
cold:</p>
<p><strong>john’s pov - jenny &amp; marley</strong>: Jenny sits on the
couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his shoulders between her knees,
his big head resting in her lap. His tail hangs flat between his legs.
His eyes are turned up at her, and he whimpers softly. Jenny strokes his
head a few times and then, with no warning, buries her face in the thick
fur of his neck and begins sobbing. They stay like that for a moment,
Marley statue- still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.
John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No words, just
being there. A lesson here. Her head down, Jenny raises one arm up
towards John and John goes to the couch and wraps his arms around both
of them. We then…</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: Oh. He’s… big.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds. He just wants
to say hi. He won’t hurt you. Just stand still and be calm. You’re a dog
person, right?</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: well, actually -</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: - Ready?</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: okay? John releases Marley who springs on
Debby, knocking her back.</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: I’m okay! I’m okay!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not supposed to do that. You have to knee
him. Anyway, it won’t happen the whole time. Just maybe when you come
home. This is everything you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is
a spirited dog who loves interaction. We’ve never left him before but
we’re sure he’ll behave just as he does when we’re at home. They kiss
him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to Marley, grabs his
leash and struggles with all her might to hold on to Marley.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: reads about Ireland in the guide book. Jenny sees
a woma with a child. She smiles. No tears.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: There are just a few things about
Marley you need to know. He eats three times a day. If he looks starved,
feed him again. Of course all this food has to go somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: Use the red shovel and the blue
bucket. Watch your step. Don’t worry about the color. He likes
mangoes.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: Marley’s ears get a lot of wax
buildup. Once or twice while we’re gone, please use cotton balls and the
blue ear- cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear old clothes and try not
to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: Marley is an excellent watchdog. And
in this neighborhood, that’s a good thing. You can rest easy at night,
knowing he’s on the job.</p>
<p><strong>jenny’s voice</strong>: Thunderstorms are his weak point.
Well, one of his weak points. You can give him sedatives if you think a
storm is arriving. He doesn’t like them, so push them down into his
throat as far as they go.</p>
<p><strong>debby is</strong>: Marley is tearing through the house,
terrified. chasing him with a bottle of tranquilizers.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: We do not allow Marley to get up on
any piece of furniture, chew on anything except his toys, drink out of
the toilet - keep the lid closed and the brick on the lid -</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: - actually, you might want to keep the
bathroom door closed in general.</p>
<p><strong>john’s voice</strong>: Other than that, enjoy him! Thanks so
much. Love, Jenny and John.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butterly</strong>: And if you need anything during the
night, I’m right next door. The blankets are wool. Good heat in
them.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, they’re electric?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butterly</strong>: No, not in this house. My brother
died in a fire, God rest him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butterly</strong>: In this room, actually. It’s been re-
papered. Good night. God bless. Jenny sits on the bed. The CREAKING is
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Look, I know we haven’t had sex since… you
know. But there’s no way we’re breaking the streak tonight.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No kidding. ’Cause it’s not just God watching.
God, his mother… .and apparently his best friend.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s July, but I think I can see my
breath.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t feel my toes. John gets out of his
bed and into Jenny’s. Much SQUEAKING.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My God. Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s not the mattress. It’s the shrieks of
over-sexed souls in hell.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You wanna join them? He looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you sure, because we don’t have to…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t help myself. Knowing it hasn’t
happened in this house in 50 years is a turn-on. They roll into each
others’ arms, the bed squeaking.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe she’s deaf…</p>
<p>****: They heard us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No… He jumps as Mrs. Butterly slams the teapot
on the table.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. butterly</strong>: Tea? I’m off to Mass. Mrs. Butterly
leaves. John and Jenny look at the other guests. They smile bravely.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow. Any of you hear her bed squeaking last
night? I hope she hits confession before Mass, that’s all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Debby. So how was– -Debby hurls the
binder of instructions at him.</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: There were eleven thunderstorms while you
were away. Eleven! And you were right. He doesn’t like
thunderstorms!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, yeah, wow. Eleven, huh? That is a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: And those goddamned dog tranquilizers don’t
work!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you give him four at a time?</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: I mean on humans! She hobbles to the car,
tries to get in with her crutches. They frustrate her and she ends up
beating the ground with them until she throws them down. She’s losing
it.</p>
<p><strong>debby</strong>: And just so you know, I am a dog person. But
that’s not a dog! That’s evil with a dog face! That’s also humping your
leg! Lose my number!! And she gets into her car and guns it, splintering
the crutches as she peels out. John and Jenny, watch her go, turn and
look at the front door. Marley’s face in the little square window at the
top, peeking out at them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s only thunder… John goes back to work. We
hear more THUNDER, and Marley starts howling, knocks over a floor lamp…
John looks off towards the bedroom…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny?! Can you help me out here? I got twenty
minutes to file this column! We follow John as he gets up from his desk,
heads towards the back bedroom…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny? We follow him into the room, an anxious
Marley close at his heels. She’s not here, he turns around just as she
steps out of the bathroom, smiling…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Luck of the Irish… She holds up a pregnancy
test with a clear BLUE line, her exuberant face lit up by a FLASH OF
LIGHTNING. John goes to hug her, as Marley HOWLS in the b.g., we
then…</p>
<p><strong>fade out.</strong>: SUPER: “Nine Months Later.”</p>
<p><strong>routine:</strong>: He chews through a sock. He drinks out of
the toilet. He works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub.
Another night and he’ll be in. He chases a fly. Finally he goes to his
bed on the floor of the bedroom. He settles himself down to sleep. He
yawns, he scratches, he closes his eyes. He snores. And then - He wakes
up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He gets up, sits by her side
of the bed, and waits. Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>whoa–</strong>: She catches her breath, leans over to
John.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John. John, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I think it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Ow! Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see
Marley glaring at John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay. I’m not hurting her. Jenny MOANS
again and now Marley’s eyes narrow. He takes a step towards John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please don’t scream, honey. He’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You put the car seat in this weekend, right?
They won’t let us take the baby home without the car seat installed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like I’d forget that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do what you
do best… Unsure, Marley licks the box.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, don’t lick it, eat it! Destroy it! You can
chew through drywall, man! I know you can do this! Marley catches on. He
starts shredding the box.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Car seat’s in!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah. You? Marley barks from the back seat.
They both turn and look at him. What’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Here… Stay. Be good. Please, God. No
storms. Stay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, boy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here’s the thing: in a couple of hours, we’re
gonna bring the baby home. And you’d be doing me a really big favor if
you didn’t freak out. I’m gonna try and do the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, boy… let’s go outside…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hello, Marley… She crouches down, gives him a
kiss, rubs his back. And that’s when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and
the dog freezes. Where’d that come from? We hear the coo again and this
time Marley lifts one paw in the air like a bird dog, and points in the
direction of the car seat that we now see sitting on the bed…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what I think would be a bummer? If he
ate the baby…</p>
<p><strong>116 continued:</strong>: She moves to the car seat and turns
it around so that now we see the baby for the first time. She smiles at
Marley…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This is Patrick, Marley. Jenny unbuckles
Patrick from the car seat and crouches down beside Marley and lets the
dog sniff the baby’s toes, then up his legs, finally his diaper which
puts Marley into a Pampers stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley’s
eyes glaze…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: See, he’s not gonna hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, but I’m gonna have to put a lock on the
diaper pail.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I have the quote right here– Patrick crawls
over Marley, who’s supremely patient as Patrick takes a fistful of his
eye.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well, have legal call them again and get a
release for it. They told me it was on the record– Marley– Patrick,
that’s his eye– No, not you, Karla, just get the release. I’ll call you
back.</p>
<p>****: Be gentle, Patrick! Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her
face. Then…</p>
<p>****: Laundry.</p>
<p><strong>the floor</strong>: To where Marley waits, eagerly vacuuming
up the cereal. It continues to RAIN CHEERIOS and we then BOOM BACK UP
and see that Patrick is now eight months old, laughing as he throws the
cereal onto the floor…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I need to go in tomorrow for a few hours, see
my editor. Think you can watch the baby for me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure. John looks around the room. The place is
a disaster area.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Remember us?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You mean, those younger, skinnier better
looking people? Yeah, I think I remember them. Vaguely.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I miss them. He turns back to his work.
She looks at him, sets her pad aside, comes up behind him, puts her arms
around him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: They’re still here. He looks up at their
reflection in the window, not so sure.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Honey, don’t go out there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stay here. Call the police.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: He said not to scream or he’d stab me, but I
screamed… And John sees the blood on her shirt. He takes hold of
her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay okay okay, I’ve got you…</p>
<p>****: Where’s your mom?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: At work…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny’ll call her…</p>
<p><strong>125 continued:</strong>: Marley sniffs at the ground,
growling more and more intensely. We hear SHOUTING, “He went that way”
as several neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he,
too, bolts into the night—</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley! NO! But he’s gone and John has to stay
with the girl. We hear SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down
on the ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: All this time we’ve been living here, I never
got your name.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, you’re gonna be alright, Lisa, the
police are on the way… John looks off, wondering where Marley is…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t find him anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Maybe we should get in the car, drive
around.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll get the keys… John’s coming into the
house when a police cruiser pulls to the curb in front of the house. A
POLICEMAN gets out of the driver’s side, then opens the back and leads
Marley out. He bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We found him outside the 76 station on
Radford. He had the guy cornered in the men’s room.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: So you caught the guy?</p>
<p>****: jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the barrel of my shotgun,
and ate half my radio mic. They look at Marley wagging his tail,
panting.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Anyway, the neighbors all said he belonged
here, but none of them wanted to drive him, so…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks for bringing him home.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Helluva dog. John nods as The Officer heads
back to his car. Jenny crouches down and gives Marley a big hug and a
back rub…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: My hero.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Stay. –and starts to unhook Patrick from his
car seat. Marley bolts out of the car and heads straight for the
house…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can I see a set-up, please?</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Certainly. First home?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, we live up in West Palm, over on
Churchill?</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Ooooh. Well, I think you’d find this
neighborhood to be quite a pleasant change. And now Marley bolts past
him into the house, tracking wet footprints all over the floor, jumps up
onto the REALTOR.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Oh… my… hello…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, who’s dog is that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny? A wet Marley bounds into the house,
heads for the back. John follows.</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: Jenny is crouched on the floor when John
appears in doorway.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. You alright? She stands up, smiles the
best she can.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m fine. Where you guys been?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wanna show you something.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A house. It’s a little pricey, but I think we
can do it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, I know we’ve talked about it, but I’m
not sure this is the right time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And when would the right time be, Jen? After
one of us gets stabbed in the driveway?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: C’mon, honey, we’re cramped in here. This was
supposed to be our three-year house, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know, but we can’t afford to buy a new
one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure, we can. With both our salaries–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, about that… I don’t think I’m gonna be
able to keep working.</p>
<p>****: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? Are you sure? She steps away, revealing
the counter where FOUR PREGNANCY TESTS are lined up, all with the same
result: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Already? I mean, how old’s the one you
got?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: About eight months.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Jesus. Haven’t you heard of birth
control?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn’t work. You
know what else doesn’t work? The one about how “A dog will stop your
wife’s biological clock.”</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey, I’m not the one, keeps getting her
pregnant. John gives him a look, sees Arnie heading into his office,
takes a breath and gets to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m sure he’ll give you the raise.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: He always gives me one. John just shakes
his head, starts for Arnie’s office.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Why should I do this, why are you worth
it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because I’m doing a good job?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, since I took over, the column has
doubled in readership…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: So you are doing a good job.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: So why not make it permanent?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You mean, like forever?</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: That’s what the word “forever” means.
Yes.</p>
<p>****: John, you know how many yo yo’s in the other room would kill to
have their own column? You took a piece of crap About Towner and turned
it into something fresh.</p>
<p>****: I hate to break it to you, son, but you’re a good
columnist.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I just had this idea about myself, you know,
that I was a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Yeah, well sometimes life comes up with a
better idea. Tell you what. You make it a daily column and I’ll double
your salary. How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>****: You’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: well, I don’t blame you. I just thought I’d
come over and say– But Marley comes running over and she crouches down
to greet him. She hugs him a while…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I’m gonna miss you. John watches as she holds
on to him a bit longer, thanking him as well. John turns away, starts
back for the van to give her a moment. She stands up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Where you moving to?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Boca.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh… what?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Nothing. I just… never pictured, you know, a
guy like you moving to Boca.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A guy like me?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you think I’m young and cool. And you’re
not just saying that because I saved your life?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved my
life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh,</p>
<p><strong>wait–</strong>: He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a
chewed-up black Converse.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I believe this belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Thanks. I’ll have to chew up the other one to
make it match. Have fun down there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. It’s gonna be great.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Shhh, honey. Come on. John follows now…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is he wet?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: No. And I can’t get a burp out of him. I
think it’s colic.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Want me to drive him?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We can’t do that every night. From the other
room, we HEAR Patrick CRYING, “Mommy!”</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll do the washer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can you take him? I just need a minute to
myself. John takes the baby and instantly Conor starts crying
louder.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Happens every time.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You just need to spend more time with
him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s okay, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m doing it! It’s fine! You tell me to spend
more time with him, I do it, and then you take over because I’m not
doing it right.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t want you changing him when you’re
mad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not mad! He hears himself, lets her change
the baby. She takes him, sits down with him in a rocking chair, tries to
nurse him…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Conor, come on… Conor, please… She finally
stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly at John.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Mothers
are supposed to be able to give their baby everything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s just colicky, Jen. He’ll grow out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, here’s an idea, you stay here and I’ll
go to work while he grows out of it. He holds up his hands, what does he
say to that. She looks up at him a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m just tired, alright? Go on. She then
resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of the room. She rocks
back and forth, looks up with a dark expression as she hears his CAR
START.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: It’s post partum depression…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Her hormones are all on tilt and she’s
depressed. It happens. After my fourth kid was born, I’d wake up, find
my wife just staring at me with a mallet in her hand. I thought she was
gonna kill me in my sleep. I still do…</p>
<p>****: Did you get her the gift?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Huh. That usually works. Arnie gets off the
desk, says to the Photographer:</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Alright, Janice, make him look pretty. The
man’s an official columnist now. Arnie moves off and the photographer
looks up from her camera and smiles at John. He smiles back. She keeps
smiling… so does he… she finally indicates his hair…</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: You have a Barney sticker in your–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh– thanks. He rakes his fingers through his
hair, grabs the offending sticker, looks at her…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I must look like hell… I don’t think I’ve had
a full night sleep in two months.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Stress?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Kids. I got one with colic, and another, can’t
make it through the night without coming into my room every two
hours.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Well, I think you’re holding up great.
You look cute.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Yeah, like a cute, exhausted Dad. It’s
adorable. John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,
he’ll never reach it. She smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: You certainly look a lot better than
Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him to take a new picture, but he
liked the one they took the day he started the column, nineteen years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nineteen years, huh… And just when he thought
one dagger was brutal enough, his expression goes really pensive. And on
that look, we see a FLASH as she takes his picture and go right to:</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll get him. John leaves the room. Jenny sits
there.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Mommy? Jenny wakes up on autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, honey, let’s go back to bed. She leads
him out of the room. And a second later Conor starts crying. John lies
there a moment, then gets up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jen, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>reverse - on jenny</strong>: She’s crying, her back to John
who’s now in the b.g. A moment, then…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You ruined it! Bad dog! She leaves the room
and John looks at the dog.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You just had to eat the book? What, have you
got some kind of death wish? I’m telling you, you better chill, or
she’ll kill you. Right after she kills me.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Look! Jenny turns and sees A BUS, with
John’s picture on the side, an advertisement for his column. She watches
it pass.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Uh-huh. I see him. And she goes back to
loading the car.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Stay. She now lays down and closes her eyes.
A moment of peace. And then, somewhere in the distance we hear a faint
BEEP BEEP BEEP as some truck backs up. Marley lifts his head, perks up
his ears and listens. Please don’t bark, dog. Please don’t bark. BEEP
BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room… Jenny opens her eyes with
a start as Marley runs barking through the house, we hear something
CRASH and break O.S.</p>
<p><strong>149 continued:</strong>: And now Conor’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck
everything! Why?!! She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates,
and just shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for
Conor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why’s Marley out in the–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want that dog out of here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. I’ll take him out. She looks up at
him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I want you to get him out of here and keep
him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’d he do–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I mean it, John. I want him gone. I want him
gone for good.</p>
<p><strong>sees the</strong>: A sad John posts a “DOG FOR SALE” sign. A
CO-WORKER sign and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: That the dog in your column? Obed ience
school? Necklace in the poop? Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>puts</strong>: John watches the guy walk off, scribbles a new
it up. This one reads “E F D TO GOOD HOME.” comes up to John.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You giving up the dog? i thought yo u
loved that thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny wants him out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That’s harsh, man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what else to do. She’s really
unhappy. Maybe the dog is just one too many things.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: They’re all unhappy. Trust me. Well… who
knows? Maybe you’ll get lucky and nobody’ll want him. John just nods,
thinks about that. Sebastian glances around, then takes John aside.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Listen, there’s something I gotta tell
you.</p>
<p>****: I’m leaving the paper.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I just gave Arnie my notice. John looks
over at Arnie’s office, the door’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: He’s not too happy about it. He called me
an ungrateful quizzling and threw a stapler at me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You going over to the Post?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m going to New York. Sebastian smiles.
John doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The Gray Lady came courting last
week.</p>
<p>****: Times, I’m talking about the New York</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know who you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t seem happy for me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am. I’m just in shock. I mean, I’m in
Florida because of you. Woodward and Bernstein. Remember? That was the
idea.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah, that was the idea before you
decided to be the Andy Rooney of South Florida.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t decide to be anything–</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Exactly. Boom. That hurts John. They
stand there a moment, considering each other, then.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Look, man, you’re happy doing your thing
and I’m not trying to piss on that. I mean it, you’re good at it. I just
wanted you to be the first to know. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Smart boy.</p>
<p><strong>the</strong>: Yeah, uh… Monday, then. Give us weekend.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Up to you. John looks at the dogs in the
back, all of them trying to get his attention.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: These are all responses to the column you
wrote last week. John thinks a moment…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: One where you said you may have to give the
dog away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh. I assume they all want me to keep him.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: No. They’re all saying they’d take him. Arnie
moves on and John stares at the letters.</p>
<p><strong>158 continued: 158</strong>: Marley follows, jumping up,
trying to get the toys back out of the box. John grabs a frisbee, looks
at the dog.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t lo any more of these, ok ay? Because
they s e ’re not gonna keep getting you more, and I won’t be there to
look for them… He looks at Marley standing there wagging his tail.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re gonna be fine, alright. I’ll just be
different. Maybe e it’ll, b better, nobody poking your yanking your
tail. Who knows? Could be better.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s all packed up. Patrick will want to say
good-bye, but Conor’s too young</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you mean? Three days ago, you were
pretty clear–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know, but you can’t do it. I won’t let you.
You can’t give away Marley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, wait. I’m lost. You told me you didn’t
want him around. What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: The fact that you would have done something
like that, for me, that you love me that much…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: well, that blows me away. And we’re not doing
this. It was wrong of me to ask. He comes over and sits down beside
her.</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: Maybe not, maybe Marley is one thin too many.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I got overwhelmed, John. I mean, be. one
tells you how hard it’s gonna</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Which part?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: All of it. Marriage. Being a parent. It’s the
hardest thing in the world and no one prepares you for that. No one
tells you how much you have to give up.</p>
<p>****: me. I gave up so much of what makes me But I’m not allowed to
say that. People think you’re a bad person if you say that. But it’s how
I feel sometimes, and I need you to know that.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: It’s not your fault. It’s just something I
have to figure out. But Marley going, that won’t fix anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: Okay. She kisses him on the cheek, then gets up and goes into
the bathroom. He sits on the edge of the bed, staring down the hall…</p>
<p><strong>his pov -marley</strong>: to how they’ve At the end of the
hall, panting, oblivious both just been spared.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I made reservations at Sunny’s. Thought we
could all sit outside.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Sounds perfect. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: To a perfect day with my boys.</p>
<p><strong>behind them</strong>: A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a
poodle on a jeweled leash, shrieks excitedly as she meets up with
another woman, same type, with another small fluffy’dog. The little dogs
yip. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has spotted
the poodles and is now locked and loaded.</p>
<p><strong>on john and jenny</strong>: As suddenly their table suddenly
leaps away from them and starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into
other tables, banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE
as it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones. The four Grogans sit
facing each other across, their drinks suddenly in their laps. Marley is
pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards the now-terrified
small dogs. He is chugging forward with every ounce of rippling muscle
he has.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley! John hurries after the dog; Jenny
stays with the boys.</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: As Marley-with-table approaches
the small dogs, they break free of their leashes and run. Several
innocent bystanders are knocked off their feet. There’s a florist kiosk
in the center of the plaza; Marley- and-table take out most of the
merchandise. Security guards look around wildly. It’s pandemonium, but
Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a, one poor
poodle runs for her life. Finally, back where Marley started, the
terrified toy poodle leaps into Jenny’s arms. Marley tries to brake
-</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, no! - and suddenly, he is jerked back.
John has tackled the table Marley’s dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on
his bac k, then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog
in the world. Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent.
They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps out of her
arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny’s head is in her hands, her
shoulders heaving…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jen, you okay?</p>
<p>****: Jenny? And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her
whole body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES– –A BABY
CRYING and we now go to…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Boys, say hello to Colleen… We PULL BACK TO
REVEAL: Patrick, now six and Conor four, standing beside the bed with
John. They all crowd around “mom” as the NURSE now takes a picture. On
the FLASH, we…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John, telephone.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Mom, look what we did!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Who was on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Philadelphia Inquirer. She looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They’re offering me a job.</p>
<p>****: As a reporter. I guess the editor was down here on vacation,
read my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I said thank you very much, but I’m happy
where I am. I mean, it’s a big change, Florida to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Anyway. John smiles at her, then goes to his
sons…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: C’mon, guys, back to work… She watches as he
kneels down beside the boys, resumes digging alongside them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, that’s part of the job. To get reader
response.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: re? You notice any recurring themes the</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. We’ve got a lot of cranks in Broward
County.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Yeah. Including y�gu the last couple months.
“.. .if he doesn’t like it here, he</p>
<p><strong>from your</strong>: should move”… “more whining resident
malcontent”… “is there anything good about Florida according to
Mr. Grogan?”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Arnie, I’m a commentator. We’ve got issues
here. Over-crowding, crime, immigration tensions, runaway</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Florida hasn’t soured, John. You have.</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe it’s turning 40 next week,
or maybe…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Maybe what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe I’m sick of my column. I don’t really
think I’m all that interesting.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Are you kidding? You’re the comic voice of
South Florida’s middle class. You’re a national treasure. Well, a
regional treasure. Municipal treasure, for sure. You’re just a little
burned out. Why don’t you take a coupweeks off? Consider it my birthday
present.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Happy birthday, honey! And he kisses Jenny.
Hugs the kids. Jenny watches him as he i en t e d , distracted. shakes
hands, hugs their friends, disor</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Forty. Jesus Christ… He looks at Marley a
moment, then…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, buddy, you and me are the same age. You
got more grey hair than me, though…</p>
<p>****: Mind if I just hang here for a minute? And sits on the floor,
his back against the washing machine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, who wants to help me here? Kids? Marley,
you too. Jenny squats down with the cake, and John and his kids start to
blow out the candles.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One, two - And then Marley jumps the gun,
takes a huge bite of the cake, lit candles and all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: - three.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, tell the truth, were you really
surprised?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Thanks, Jen. She sits down on his
lap…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You want your present?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is it what you gave me last year? Because that
was real nice– She hands him an envelope.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Happy Birthday. He opens it, pulls out an
AIRLINE TICKET.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A plane ticket?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: To Philadelphia. So you can talk to the
editor of the inquirer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That was months ago–</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I called the editor last week. They’d still
like to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jenny, I couldn’t do that, uproot us. We’ve
got our friends, the schools…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: First of all, you don’t even have the job
yet, it’s just an interview. Second of all, you don’t have that many
friends.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you. What I was trying to say, is that
our life is here.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Baby, I got news for you, our life is
wherever we are. And you’re not happy here anymore, doing that column.
You’re restless, John. I feel it. I feel it when you read Sebastian’s
articles every day. And I feel it when you sit out in the driveway an
extra five minutes before you come in.</p>
<p>****: Maybe it’s time for a change.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for that.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Not so late. She stands up in the dark, lifts
her dress over her head.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re not old, John. We can still surprise
ourselves. He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She
surfaces and smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey. You want your other birthday present or
not?</p>
<p><strong>into</strong>: John can’t get out of his clothes fast enough.
He leaps the pool and swims over to her, kisses her.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: We’re not old. And then we hear ANOTHER
splash.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh-oh… And a moment later Marley’s head goes
bobbing by.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Hey, Gorgan. John smiles to himself, walks
over.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: I just wanted to say good luck up there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Also, there’s a good chance that every piece
of advice I ever gave you, may in fact be total crap.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I appreciate it just the same. They stand
there a moment, awkward. Then…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: This would be where a mushier guy would tell
you he’s proud of you, give you a hug, and send you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Really glad you’re not that guy, sir. Arnie
nods, goes back into his office and shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>174 in. airplane - day</strong>: The Grogans are in the back
of the plane.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look. There’s Marley! THROUGH THE WINDOW they
can see Marley’s crate arriving at the plane on a luggage truck. Marley
is asleep, heavily drugged. Conor starts banging on the window.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Hey, Marley! We’re up here!</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: He can’t hear you with the engine
going.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not to mention the tranquilizers. I think he’s
already reached his cruising altitude.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: is that a dog?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Marley’s Sad. Marley’s our dog. He’s with
the suitcases. John smiles weakly at the Passenger.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What an imagination, huh?</p>
<p>****: We don’t have a dog. He makes the crazy sign with his finger,
gesturing at Patrick. The MOANING gets worse. John just smiles
tightly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley! Marley jumps into a pile of leaves,
scatters them everywhere, rolls over onto his back and knocks over a
rake, which falls and breaks a basement window.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And… we’re home.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Hey, John. Settling in okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m fine, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Good. I want you to meet Billy… He indicates
the twenty-something guy beside him. John and Billy shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Billy’s gonna show you the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re the Florida guy, right? The dog
columns…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, some of them were, but–</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Cute stuff. C’mon, I’ll show you around.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? And then Conor and Patrick burst into
the room.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: It’s here!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Okay, time for lunch!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll bring this in. Go on up. The kids and
Marley head up to the house. John drags the toboggan up the hill. He
pauses at the top and looks down at the toboggan run. He gets on the
toboggan.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Honey, what’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t remember the last time I rode on a
toboggan..</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Exactly. He starts sliding down the hill.
Marley runs for him as he builds up speed…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley, no!</p>
<p><strong>181 continued: 181</strong>: But Marley jumps onto John’s lap
as they get going…</p>
<p><strong>on the toboggan</strong>: Flying down the hill. Marley is
much heavier than the kids, and they sail past the place where the kids
stopped, through the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging
branches,</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John! The creek! The toboggan bumps over the
crest of a small hill and sails through the air, landing with a crash on
the iced-over creek. John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the
opposite side. A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in
delight. John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley
comes up and romps with him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey… wanna do it again?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>183 patrick’s bedroom - night 183</strong>: From the low
angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side, sleeping. And then we see
Marley’s head rise and reveal itself as Marley lifts it to look at John
standing there. He’d been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He
looks at John, knows he’s not supposed to be there, but…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s alright, pal. I won’t tell.</p>
<p>****: We kicked ass down that hill, didn’t we? John smiles at him and
continues up to bed.</p>
<p><strong>184 continued:</strong>: A moment later, a yellow dot appears
on the horizon. As it gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as
we now see that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside
Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Hey, boy. We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as
the boys start up the road towards home, Marley bounding between them,
nipping at Patrick’s backpack.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hit me, I’m open! Patrick throws the ball to
John who catches it, mocks stiff- arms his way to the front steps with
the boys now hanging off him as he gives the play-by-play…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My God, look at Grogan– two three- hundred
pound linemen literally hanging off him, but he won’t be denied! And now
Marley jumps on them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from the
Strong Safety and the unthinkable happens… GROGAN GOES DOWN… And he
collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps, Marley all over them,
licking whatever faces he can get. Colleen comes out the front door,
stands at the top of the steps…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Mommy says dinner and take off your
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Alright… c’mon guys… They all get up, start up
the steps. Marley follows, takes one step when his hind legs buckle.
John looks back at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You okay, boy? C’mon… Marley tries the second
step and again his legs give out. He looks up at them…</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: What’s wrong with him, Daddy?</p>
<p>****: Nothing’s wrong. He’s just tired. Right, Dad? John sees the way
Patrick is looking at him, knows he’s protecting his little brother.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s right. Football just took it out of
him. C’mon, let’s give him a hand. And now the three of them go to
Marley, help him up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Too much color.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Yeah, I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s a
good piece, but… you’re reporting now, John. I want you to tell the
story, I don’t want you to be in the</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m pretty sure I don’t mention myself–</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: The point is, I still feel you in there.
John sits there, thinking about that.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: All I’m saying is: less you, more facts.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Marley! They all begin waving their hands in
front of their faces.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I think someone needs to go out.</p>
<p>****: Come on, boy… Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the
front door.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s pouring out there… He grabs his slicker
and heads back out…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley! Now Jenny appears in the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley! John starts off into the dark…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He can’t be too far…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’ll show up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s just out exploring. You know how much he
likes the woods.</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Bobby says dogs, when they’re going to die,
they go away to do it. That’s what his beagle did.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And that’s true… for beagles. But not labs
like Marley. He’s just out there making trouble somewhere. Don’t
worry…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Well, if you see him… thanks. He hangs
up, goes to the window.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m gonna get in the car, maybe drive</p>
<p><strong>over to–</strong>: Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay, boy, it’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: He’s on an IV for fluids and a
sedative.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: His stomach twisted. He ate or drank
something quickly, took in a lot of air and his stomach flipped. I got a
tube down which let out some of the gas. I think i untwisted it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So he’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: For now. But once this happens, it almost
always happens again. And if it does, there’s not gonna be anything I
can do. He’s too old for that kind of surgery.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What if it doesn’t happen again?</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: More than likely, it will.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But what if it doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: I just think you should prepare yourself
that he might not make it through the night.</p>
<p>****: Maybe one percent of dogs ever survive</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One percent? What’s that number based on?</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: Mr. Grogan–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll tell you what it’s based on: regular
dogs. Lady, we are so far from ’regular”, you have no idea.</p>
<p>****: My guy here… He once ate an entire answering machine, and
digested it. Then went back and ate the phone for dessert. So don’t give
me numbers like “one percent,” because you don’t know him. But I do, and
I’ll see him in the morning. We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the
exam room, walks down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he
PASSES US as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car and
stops. We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and
doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re just gonna have to wait and see. If he
makes it through the night, I think we’ll be alright. He notices the
album.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’re you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Your old columns. He’s in a lot of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>198 continued:</strong>: John rotates the album for a better
look.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You saved these?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Every one. He looks up at her.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Even on the crappiest day, when the boys were
driving me nuts and the laundry wasn’t done and a hundred other things
were hard, I knew I had this. Five minutes of you. Sometimes they were
funny and sometimes they were sad, or silly or whatever, but they were
all you. And for those five minutes, you made me feel better. She gets
up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his head. Then, as she
starts out…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You should read them. They’re pretty
great.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello? Alright. Thank you. He hangs up, sees
Jenny now standing in the doorway, tying her robe, looking at him
anxiously.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s coming home.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Marley’s back! John opens the tail gate
just as the kids come rushing onto the porch, Marley’s tail wagging as
he’s lifted out of the car and set on the ground, the kids now
surrounding him…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice place. How long you been here?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Two years, little more. Sebastian sees
John looking at all of the unpacked boxes.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m in and out of town so much I really
haven’t had a chance to settle in. I hired a decorator, but she and I
got into a thing and it got messy–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Beer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t, I still got one more interview to
do.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but
beer and hunk of Parmesan.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s the piece again?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Right, you told me that. So you’re down
in Philly now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just outside. More space for the kids.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Whatta you got, five now?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Three. Here’s a picture of everybody… John
pulls a photo from his wallet, hands it to Sebastian.</p>
<p>****: Jenny’s holding up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, she’s great. And that’s Colleen our
youngest…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s with the ladybug get-up?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yeah, that’s a funny story. She had done
this pageant at her preschool two weeks before, but she didn’t wanna
take off the costume, plus Marley went ballistic for the antenna which
is why it looks like he’s trying to eat her head.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, that is funny. So I was thinking later on maybe Thai?
There’s this new place in the meat Packing District. How’s that sound?
Be just like old times. John stands there a moment, feeling the distance
between them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh, well, actually I’m headed back home later
today.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In fact, I should probably get going…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Alright. Good seeing you, man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For sure.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh, hey, be sure to check out the
Delegates Lounge at the U.N… Great Mojitos, really hot interpreters.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks for the tip. And John goes out the
door. Sebastian takes out his blackberry, dials…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey, it’s Sea-bass. What’re you up to
tonight?</p>
<p>****: Oh. No, that’s cool. Another time then. He hangs up, stands
there in the middle of his big, empty apartment a moment. He then dials
another number.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey, it’s Sea-bass. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello? Anybody home? He sees a note , and
peers into:</p>
<p><strong>the kitchen</strong>: Where Marley is up on his hind legs,
eating something off the counter. John puts his keys down, but Marley
doesn’t react. John sneaks up behind him. Marley keeps eating the
grilled cheese sandwich off the plate…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Marley? Hey, boy. Marley looks up briefly as
if he heard something, but then returns to eating. John is right behind
him. John reaches out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally
guilty. Then he turns and greets John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s the matter, boy? You didn’t hear me?
Huh? He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s go for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, boy, just a little further to the
top… Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy. John looks at him,
can see how tired he is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what, this is a good spot right here.
John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the damp earth
beside Marley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s just sit for a while. The two of them
sit there, looking out at the beautiful countryside below. John strokes
Marley for a moment. Looks at the grey hair, the tired eyes that now
look back at him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey. So… you’re gonna tell me, right? When
it’s time? Because I don’t wanna make that decision on my own. So you
just let me know when you’re ready, okay? Marley rests his chin on
John’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Marley? Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not up here.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in
front of the dying fire.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess I could move his bed down here. John
sits down beside Marley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Man. He’s always slept with us. Now he can’t
even make it upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He looks pretty comfortable to me.</p>
<p>****: I’ll go get his bed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey Jen? why don’t you grab a blanket for me,
too. She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow from the
couch and lays down beside Marley.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is a good spot. I may never sleep
upstairs again.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Hey. Scooch over. He looks up and see that
Jenny’s brought a blanket. She lies down with them. John puts his arm
around them both. Marley’s tail begins gently pounding the floor.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’d be twice a week. Six hundred words.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: And what’s the subject?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go through.
But funnier.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I don’t get it. I thought you came here to
be a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I did, but I think we both know that isn’t me.
I’m a columnist. A good one. A SECRETARY sticks her head in the
office…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: John– your wife’s on the phone. She says
it’s important…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be right there. Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t get him back inside. He’s lying out
there in cold… and he won’t move…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Patrick came home and we got him here.
Dr. Platt said if he’s comfortable, leave him here for a while and see.
But he’s no better. John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but
doesn’t wag his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -
then over his stomach, the dog flinches.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m taking him in. The kids all come into the
room, Colleen carrying a stuffed sheep.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Is he sick again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, he is, honey. But I’m going to take him
to the hospital and they’ll try to make him better. Conor bends down,
nuzzles Marley’s face.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: Get better, Mar.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: You can take Lamby, okay? But don’t chew
her other ear off. Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers
right in</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: Goodbye. When he looks up at his father,
John can see that Patrick’s crying, that he knows what the other two
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You wanna walk? He sets him down gingerly.
Hesitantly, Marley walks over to the tree that countless dogs have peed
on, sniffs it, then looks around. John looks around, too. It’s a crisp
spring night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nice night, huh? Marley looks around, then
looks at John. There’s something in his expression. John nods, knows
what he’s saying.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, boy. Okay. John, his heart breaking,
bends down to carry Marley up the front steps of the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: I did everything that worked before. But
no luck. There’s still surgery,</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: –not strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: There’s blood in his stomach. The lining
might be compromised. I don’t know what we’ll find if we go in there
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you give me a minute? I need to… I need to
call my wife.</p>
<p>****: It’s me. It’s the stomach thing again. Nothing’s working. They
could do surgery, but…</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I know. Jenny nods as tears come. They stay
on the phone, quiet, just being with each other. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I love you, John.</p>
<p>****: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: I’ll give you some time. She goes. John
stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed lamb out of his pocket, places
it under a paw. When John puts a hand on his flank, Marley’s eyes
flutter open. His tail THUMPS gently.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, buddy. He pets Marley’s head, runs his
hands all over Marley’s body. His coat, still shedding. His tail. He
takes up each paw, each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same
time. He leans down, puts his nose on Marley’s neck and breathes him in.
Then he goes around, squats down so he’s on Marley’s level. He looks
into Marley’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen, you know all that stuff we always said
about you? What a total pain you are? The world’s worst dog? Well, don’t
you believe it. Don’t believe it for a minute. You loved us, every day,
no matter what. And that’s a pretty amazing thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, I don’t know where you’re going from
here, but you remember this: You’re a great dog, Marley. You are a great
dog.</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: He won’t feel a thing. He’ll just slip
away. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re ready. Dr. Platt inserts the needle into
the I.V. and presses the plunger.</p>
<p><strong>dr. platt</strong>: He’s gone. FROM ABOVE, the dog on the
table, the doctor discreetly going to the side, and John laying his head
next to Marley and putting his arms around him as we now…</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: He’s wrapped in his blanket…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So he’ll be warm.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: You guys want to read your letters?</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Mine is a picture. Of me and Marley. And
grasshoppers. And ice cream. Mommy wrote what I said. “Dear Marley. I
will never forget you, forever.” And those are kisses.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s beautiful, honey. He’ll like it. Drop it
in. Conor? Conor reads his piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>conor</strong>: “Dear Marley. I loved you all my life. I hope
you like heaven and that there’s lots to chew on. Your brother, Conor
Richard Grogan.” John puts his hand on Conor’s shoulder as Conor drops
in the letter into the grave.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Patrick? Do you want to say anything?</p>
<p><strong>patrick</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I’d like to give him something. Jenny reaches
behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace John gave Jenny when she
first got pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: This little necklace has been on quite a
journey. John smiles at her, remembering. So much shared history.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your dad gave this to me to celebrate the
beginning of our family. But you know what? Our family had already
begun. She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the
blanket, lets her hand rest there a moment, then stands up.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Good-bye, Clearance Puppy.</p>
<p><strong>john’s pov - the house</strong>: All lit up. We see the kids
sitting by the fire while Jenny moves about the kitchen getting dinner
ready. John sits there watching them. watching his family. The family
that both he and Marley grew up in. He gives the fresh dirt a final,
loving pat and then, as the last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and
heads for home.</p>
