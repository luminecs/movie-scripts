<p><strong>lojur</strong>: Captain, she’s not answering her helm –</p>

Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We
have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require

<p><strong>14 omitted 14</strong>: THRU THRU 22 22</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Search me. Anybody know how come we made the
A list?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: My shore leave was just cancelled. Isn’t this
just for top brass?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Where is Mr. Sulu?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain Sulu… on assignment… anyone seen
Spock?</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: This briefing is classified. There
will be no recording devices. Ladies and Gentlemen, the C-in-C.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Two months ago a Federation Starship
monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis. We believe it was
caused by over mining and insufficient safety precautions. The moon’s
decimation means an almost eighty percent loss of available energy and a
deadly pollution of their ozone. Due to their large military
expenditures, the Klingon economy is in a very weakened condition. They
do not have sufficient resources to manufacture air shelters in large
enough quantities to sustain anything like their current population.
Last month - at the behest of the, uh, Vulcan Ambassador - I opened a
dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council. He
proposes to commence negotiations at once.</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: Negotiations for what?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The dismantling of our space stations and
star bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to seventy years of
unremitting hostility - a hostility the Klingons can no longer
afford.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If the Klingons sue for peace, we could
accumulate savings in defense expenditures, leaving the Federation
economy free to grapple with urgent social problems…</p>
<p><strong>a military man</strong>: Bill, are we talking about
mothballing the Starfleet?</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: I must protest. To offer the
Klingons a safe haven within Federation space is suicide. Klingons would
become the alien trash of the galaxy. And if we dismantle the fleet,
we’d be defenseless before a bellicose people with a foothold on our
territory. The opportunity which presents itself here is to embargo
trading, force them to run through their own resources faster, and bring
them to their knees. Then we’ll be in a far better position to dictate
terms.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sir -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sir, I’m no diplomat, but the Klingons have
never been trustworthy. I’m forced to agree with Admiral Donald. This is
- - a terrible, a terrifying idea…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It is imperative that we act NOW to support
the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his
empire that it would be better to attempt a military solution and die
fighting.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We have volunteered to rendezvous with the
Klingon ship that’s bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him
safely through Federation space.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why, in God’s name?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I have personally vouched for you in this
matter, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You have personally -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Surely a full Ambassador would be better
equipped to -</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: I don’t know whether to congratulate
you or not, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: WE volunteered?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There’s an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon
could go to China.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How could you vouch for me? That’s… … arrogant
presumption -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was asked by my father to open neg-</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I know your father’s the Vulcan Ambassador for
heaven’s sake, but you know how I feel about this: they’re animals.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Jim, there is an historic opportunity here
-</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: DON’T TRUST THEM. DON’T BELIEVE THEM -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They’re dying.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: LET THEM DIE.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Has it occurred to you that this crew is due
for retirement in three months? WE’VE DONE OUR BIT FOR KING AND
COUNTRY.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You should have trusted me.</p>
<p><strong>24 omitted (poss. alternate) 24</strong>: &amp; &amp; 24 VFX
24 VFX</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Well, I’ve heard some whoppers in my
time…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: They’re mothballing the fleet?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We will regret this…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Captain on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: As you were. Lieutenant…?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Saavik, sir. We were told you’d need a
helmsman - … so I volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you. The
Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class
as the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make
you very proud…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I don’t believe so, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: She’s a Vulcan all right.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: All right, let’s get this over with… departure
stations… Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Aye, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You find the engine room?</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Right where I left it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Standby. Get me the dock master, Uhura.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Control tower, reading, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Control, this is Enterprise requesting
permission to depart.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: This is control. Enterprise, you are
granted permission to depart… 30 seconds for port gates…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Clear all moorings…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Awaiting port gates from this mark.</p>
<p><strong>filtered voice</strong>: Mooring lines cleared…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Aft thrusters -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you. Lieutenant, one quarter impulse
power…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Captain, may I remind you that
regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Uh, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You heard the order, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. space dock 26</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>27 omitted 27</strong>: THRU THRU 29 29</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: … I don’t care if I’m senile. If I sit in this
chair and give the word you jump.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Kronos, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m still in the chair, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. space 31</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice over</strong>: Captain’s log. Stardate 8679.225.
They say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks - and maybe they’re
right. It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the
Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I have never trusted Klingons and never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the murder of my boy. Spock
says this could be an historic moment and I’d like to believe him, but
how on earth can history get past people like me?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Sorry -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: We’re almost at the rendezvous - I
thought you’d want to know…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Right -</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I gather you are not enthusiastic about
the assignment… I don’t think many on board are.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant
-</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I always wanted to try that.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Only don’t try putting words in my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>spock’s voice</strong>: Enter.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor
at the Academy I have followed your career with… satisfaction. And as a
Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Sir, I speak to you as a kindred
intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in
the affairs of the Federation?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am not certain such speculations are
included among your duties, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>voice filtered</strong>: Klingon battlecruiser off the port
bow. All hands on deck. Repeat…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: In time you may come to view so- called
turning points with… skepticism.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You must have faith.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Faith…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That the universe will unfold as it
should.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Captain on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Captain, shall we raise our shields?</p>
<p><strong>35 the main display 35</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Never been this close.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our
signal.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard
rudder, bring us alongside…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Right standard rudder, Z plus five
degrees…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Channel open, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James
Kirk commanding.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor
Gorkon.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Chancellor. We’ve been ordered to escort you
through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uh, would you and your party care to dine this
evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United
Federation of Planets?</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: We’d be delighted to accept your gracious
invitation.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ll make arrangements to have you beamed
aboard at 1930 hours.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: I shall look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I hope you’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: - there is a supply of Romulan ale
aboard - it might make the evening pass more… smoothly?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Officer thinking, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Guess who is coming to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. space 39</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit
mixed…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Energize…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Chancellor Gorkon.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock,
whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer,
Montgomery Scott, chief engineer…</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Commander, face to face at last.. you have
my thanks..</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur… my
military advisor Brigadier Kerla… and this is General Chang my chief of
staff.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I’ve always wanted to meet you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m not sure how to take that.</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: Sincere admiration, Kirk -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: As one warrior to another…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uh, right this way, gentlemen. I thought you
might enjoy a brief tour…</p>
<p><strong>2nd crewman</strong>: What about that smell? You know only
the top of the line models can even talk.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: You men have work?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Then snap to it.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Your research laboratory is most
impressive…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet’s been charting and cataloging
planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic
sensors…</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: This cannot be easy for you, Captain… I
would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Would you care to go topside?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Captain, you’re not going to show them the
bridge??</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov…</p>
<p><strong>younger crewman</strong>: Would you want your daughter to
marry one?</p>
<p><strong>42 repeat 39 vfx 42</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: I give you a toast: the undiscovered country
- the future.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: HAMLET, act three, scene one.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: You have never experienced Shakespeare until
you have read him in the original Klingon.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: “To be or not to be, that is the question”
which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was
illegal.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: One of the advantages of being a thousand
light years from Federation headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: To you, Chancellor Gorkon: one of the
architects of our future.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Perhaps we are looking at something of that
future here.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Commander Spock, mindful of all your work
behind the scenes, and despite the cordiality at this mess, I do not
sense an acceptance of our people throughout your ship.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They’re naturally wary, ma’am. We’ve been at
war a long time.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: How do both sides overcome ingrained
prejudice?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Perhaps with a few small steps at a time.
Like this one.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a
peace treaty.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Captain Kirk, are you willing to give up
Starfleet?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet’s
mission has always been one of peace -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Far be it for me to dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Come now, Captain, this dinner is off the
record: in space all warriors are cold warriors.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We have never tried to –</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: You hypocritically presume that your
democratic system gives you a moral prerogative to force other cultures
to conform to your politics.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: That’s not true…!</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: General, are YOU fond of Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We do NOT impose democracy on others. We do
believe that every planet has a sovereign claim to human rights.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: “Human rights.” Even the name is racist.
The Federation is basically a “homo sapiens” only club…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Present company excepted, to be sure…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Well, I suppose we’re not perfect -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Don’t let them put words in your mouth - ! I
haven’t served 30 years in the engine room of a starship to be accused
of gunboat diplomacy!</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: In any case, we know where this is leading:
the annihilation of our culture. Klingons will replace those on the
lowest rung of the Federation employment ladder, taking menial jobs and
performing them for lower pay…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: That’s economics, not racism -</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: But you have to admit it adds up to the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Don’t be naive, Commander -!</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Who you calling naive -?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We’re explorers not diplomats!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Starfleet’s killed an awful lot of natural
phenomena in the name of “exploration”…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We follow orders…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Since when has THAT been an excuse?
Diplomacy must resolve these -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Right - leave it to the politicians to muck
it up and leave us defenseless…!</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Well. I see we have a long way to go.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has
been most… edifying.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We must do this again soon.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: You don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: I don’t blame you. If there IS to be a Brave
New World, we old people will have the hardest time living in it.
Commander Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Chancellor. A pleasure to meet you,
Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Captain, Commander…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: General Chang, a pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: “Parting is such sweet sorrow, shall we say
goodnight till it be morrow?”</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Energize.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Did you see the way they ate? Terrible table
manners.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I don’t believe our own conduct will
distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m going to sleep it off. Let me know if
there’s some other way we can screw up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Captain’s log. Stardate 8679.15. The
Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company for dinner last night.
Our manners were not exactly Emily Post. Note to the galley: Romulan ale
no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But is wasn’t the ale. That was just the
excuse we needed to say all the things that were really on our
minds…</p>
<p><strong>spock’s voice</strong>: Captain Kirk, you are wanted on the
bridge. Captain Kirk…</p>
<p><strong>vfxa vfxa</strong>: Saavik still has the conn. Spock is at
his post.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, I’m really tired…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We are reading an enormous amount of neutron
radiation.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Curiously it appears to emanate from us.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: From Enterprise?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Saavik, you know anything about a neutron
energy surge?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, anything unusual?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Just the size of my head -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I know what you mean…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What the -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We’ve fired on the Chancellor’s ship -</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Torpedo room–?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, monitor!</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Direct hit -</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Confirmed, Captain!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who’s doing that?</p>
<p><strong>advisor</strong>: We’re hit –!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Gravity generator!</p>

<p><strong>uhura</strong>: He says we’ve fired on them in a blatant act
of war.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We HAVEN’T fired -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: According to the data bank, we HAVE -
twice…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Captain, they’re coming about!</p>
<p><strong>53 onscreen 53</strong>: VFXB VFXB</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: They’re preparing to fire.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Shields up, Captain –?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Captain, our shields – !</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, signal our surrender.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: WE SURRENDER.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat
Enterprise surrenders –</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Captain, if they fire at us with our shields
down –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Negative, Captain. According to Inventory
we’re still fully loaded.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Stand down your weapons.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Captain, if –</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Stand DOWN, Mr. Scott. All stop. That’s an
order.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What the Hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I wish I knew. Uhura?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: It’s pretty chaotic over there. There’s been
some weapons fire and a lot of shouting…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m going aboard. Spock, you have the
conn.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I am responsible for involving you in this. I
will go.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’M going. You are going to be responsible for
getting me out of this. Meantime we’re not going to be the instigators
of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Perhaps you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Good luck, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I’m going too. They may need a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura, tell them we’re coming. And tell them
we’re unarmed.</p>

<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I give you my word I don’t understand what has
happened.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: We’re here to help…</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Chancellor Gorkon!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: My God, what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You feign ignorance?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: WHAT HAPPENED?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You crippled our gravitational field with a
direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic
boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s a DOCTOR!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: How can I trust –</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Are you carrying a surgeon?</p>

<p><strong>bones</strong>: Then let me help!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I need some light. Can we get him onto the

<p><strong>bones</strong>: Sweet Jesus…! He’s lost a lot of whatever
this stuff is…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Can you - ?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Jim, I don’t even know his anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: The wounds aren’t closing…</p>

<p><strong>bones</strong>: Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me?
Chancellor…?</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Father…!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones…?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: He’s gone into some kind of arrest… come on,
dammit!</p>
<p><strong>gorkon</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I
place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the
Chancellor of the High Council.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He just tried to save him!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Take them away.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: They’ve been arrested.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Mr. Spock, we’ve got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I assume command of this ship as of 0130
hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken
place, and request instructions.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: But we can’t allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire
won’t retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what
he wished to avoid.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: At least we must keep track of where they
are taken, sir. I -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’ve already addressed that question,
Mr. Scott. We’ll e able to follow the Captain’s movements.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: How did you - ?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: In the meantime we must endeavor to piece
together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this
ship fired those torpedoes.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: NO WAY!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please
accompany me.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: And if we can’t piece together what
happened? What then? Sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then Mr. Chekov, it resides in the hands of
the diplomats.</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: The Chancellor of the High
Council is dead - the result of an unprovoked attack while he traveled
to see YOU under a flag of truce on a mission of peace. Captain Kirk was
legally arrested for the crime. May I remind you that he and Doctor
McCoy boarded KRONOS ONE of their own free will. None of these facts are
in dispute, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I will demand a full investigation. You
can be assured we will cooperate with all our power to get to the bottom
of the matter. In the meantime –</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: In the meantime we expect the
Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law you claim to
cherish. Kirk and Doctor McCoy WILL stand trial for the assassination of
Chancellor Gorkon.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Out of the question. Ambassador Sarek,
there must be some way to extradite these men -</p>
<p><strong>ambassador sarek</strong>: Mr. President, I share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm
my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation: Kirk and Dr. McCoy were
properly arrested, and the Klingons are within their rights to try
them.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: And what is the position of the Romulan
government, Ambassador Nanclus?</p>
<p><strong>ambassadort nanclus</strong>: In the absence of specific
instructions from my government, I must concur with my colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: But surely you cannot believe that James
Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador nanclus</strong>: Mr. President, I don’t know what
to believe.</p>
<p><strong>klingon ambassador</strong>: I am waiting for your answer,
Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This President is not above the law.</p>
<p><strong>sec’y voice</strong>: Mr. President, Starfleet Command is
here from San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Send them in.</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Admiral Donald…Bill…</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: Mr. President we cannot allow
Federation citizens to be abducted.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: At present I’m awaiting a full report
from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar
Law.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I’ve prepared Operation Retrieve based on
the rising danger of terrorism and hostility between the Klingon empire
and the Federation. Put simply, we can go in and rescue the Starfleet
hostages and be out in 24 hours with an acceptable rate of loss in
manpower and equipment. We have the technology –</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Suppose you precipitate a full scale
war?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Then, quite frankly, Mr. President we can
clean their chronometers.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador nanclus</strong>: Mr. President, they ARE
vulnerable. There’ll never be a better time…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’d prefer not to be the President to
push the button if I can avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>admiral donald</strong>: The longer we wait, the less
accessible the hostages will be, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I’ll bear it in mind, Admiral. I think
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I do know it. And I’m afraid they’re
going to save it again. By standing trial.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Do you know I agree with everything they
said?</p>
<p><strong>ambassador sarek</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. President. And I
know my son must feel equally responsible. It was at my request that he
persuaded Kirk to undertake this mission.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: I want the crew of Enterprise in my
office tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>ambassador sarek</strong>: They’re still in space,
Mr. President - adjacent to the Neutral Zone.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Then tell your son to get the hell back
here before the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We’re to report back at once.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Doctor
McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Trouble?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We’ve been ordered to -</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: In nineteenth century France, workers
who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden
shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word
SABOTAGE.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We are experiencing a technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Excellent. I mean too bad.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I will inform Captain Spock.</p>
<p><strong>munitions businessman</strong>: You have our total support,
Mister President. My factories are standing by. We can gear up to full
weapons production in less than a week.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Thank you, Henry. Right now we’re
pursuing diplomatic channels…</p>
<p><strong>munitions businessman</strong>: Of course. No one wants a
war…</p>
<p><strong>ambassador sarek</strong>: If I may, Mr. President. The
important thing is to keep the peace process alive. If the new
Chancellor is so disposed, perhaps we can attach a rider, get some
assurance that these men won’t be executed. Then, in a year -</p>
<p><strong>sec’y voice</strong>: Mr. President, you have the new
Chancellor of the High Council calling.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Mr. President, I’ve been named Chancellor
of the High Council in my father’s place.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest
condolences on your recent loss. I want to assure you that this shameful
deed –</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Mr. President, let us come to the point:
you want the conference to go forward and so did my father. I will
attend in one week - after I’ve had the opportunity to master the
details of this position - on one condition: we will not extradite the
prisoners and you will not attempt to rescue them in a military
operation. We would consider any such attempt an act of war.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: We look forward to meeting with you next
week, Madam Chancellor. I hope you will be our guest here on –</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: After recent events you will understand I
prefer a neutral site. And in the interests of security, let us keep the
location secret.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: As you wish, Madam Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: Attack them now, Madam Chancellor - while we
still can…!</p>
<p><strong>first general</strong>: Attack or be slaves in their
world!</p>
<p><strong>second general</strong>: We can take whole by force what they
propose to divide…!</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: You don’t seem to understand our situation,
General. War is… obsolete. As we are in danger of becoming.</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: Better to die on our feet than live on our
knees…</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: That wasn’t what my father wanted -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: He was killed for what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Kirk must have a fair trial.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: But I want a conviction. You will represent
the State, General Chang.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: With the greatest pleasure, Madam
Chancellor.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: It’s as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still
registers every torpedo.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice.
One computer is lying.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: A computer canna lie, sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You can check the torpedoes visually, if you
like -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: We’ll have to check every one of them,
Mr. Scott.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: That could take hours!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Nevertheless.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: And if they’re still in place?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Then someone forged a data bank entry.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: They’ve named Gorkon’s daughter
Chancellor - it was on the news.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: I’ll bet that Klingon bitch killed her
father…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Her own father…?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Such things have happened before,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They don’t place the same value on life that
we do, Spock - you know that… take my word: she didn’t shed one bloody
tear…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: That’s hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as
Klingons have no tear ducts.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch,
Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Not as yet, sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Curious. You haven’t been assisting Commander
Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Commander Uhura has been experiencing
technical difficulties sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Very well. For twenty-four hours we’ll agree
that this conversation did not take place.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: A lie?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: An omission. After that -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Twenty-four hours from now we won’t have a
clue where the Captain is.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I know precisely where he’ll be.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You do? Where?</p>

<p><strong>chang</strong>: The State will show that Enterprise fired on
KRONOS One without provocation, the Chancellor and his advisers having
been lulled into a false sense of security with an invitation to a state
dinner aboard Captain Kirk’s vessel at 1930 hours that same evening. Do
you deny all this?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Prisoner will respond.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I don’t deny we invited them to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Where you drunk at that dinner, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Isn’t it a fact that you served Romulan ale,
a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming
potency?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The drink WAS served…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: And you still maintain your ship did not fire
on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The
record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There… were no other ships in the sector.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Did you have occasion to refer to your ship’s
data banks during that night?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I checked the data banks, yes.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: And what did they tell you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: The witness is excused - for the time
being.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: After the first hit, we lost our
gravitational field; I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then 2 Starfleet crewmen came walking toward us -</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Perhaps they merely wore Starfleet
uniforms -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I move that remark be stricken as purely
speculative…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: So ordered. Colonel Worf, we are interested
in facts, not theories.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: If the gravitational field was not
functioning, how could these men have been walking?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: They appeared to be wearing magnetic
boots.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Gravity boots.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: They fired on you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: With Starfleet issue phasers. They dashed
into the Chancellor’s stateroom, we could hear more phaser fire; then
they went back the way they’d come.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Towards the transporter room?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical
status?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Aside from a touch of arthritis, I’d say
pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: For 27 years I have been Ship’s Surgeon and
later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months
I’m due to stand down.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Stand…?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Retire.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale
at the officers’ mess on the night of question, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: We all did. But that doesn’t mean -</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: General Chang, come to the point or abandon
this line of inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first
examined him?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Have you saved patients as “barely” alive as
he was?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I didn’t have the knowledge of Klingon
anatomy I needed.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You say you are due for retirement. May I
ask: do your hands shake?</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled -</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I was nervous -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You were incompetent! - whether deliberately
or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I tried to save him! I was desperate to save
him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: The Chancellor herself will testify that the
defendant’s hands shook.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: And now we come to the architect of this
tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain,
that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: That isn’t true…!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: That, either as an instrument of Federation
policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow
conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the
Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to
make certain the job was complete.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Objection: Captain Kirk has not
been identified as the assassin.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: I offer into the record the following excerpt
from Captain Kirk’s personal log.</p>
<p><strong>kirk’s voice</strong>: I have never trusted Klingons and
never will. I have never been able to forgive them for the murder of my
boy…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Are those your words?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Spoken by you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Louder, please. We cannot hear you.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Those words WERE spoken by me.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Send to commander Enterprise: “We stand ready
to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.” Attach our
co-ordinates.</p>
<p><strong>communications officer</strong>: Is that wise, sir? I mean,
given their situation - Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Objection, your honors. My
clients’ political views are not on trial here.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Sulu’s giving us his position and telling us
he’s standing by…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: He’s placing himself in a most awkward
position…</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: On the contrary, Captain Kirk’s views and
motives are at the heart of the matter. This officer’s record shows the
accused to be an insubordinate, unprincipled career opportunist with a
history of violating the chain of command when it suited him.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Indeed the record will show that “Captain”
Kirk was once “Admiral” Kirk and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking
matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations and the law. Do
you deny you were demoted on these charges, Captain? DO NOT WAIT FOR THE
TRANSLATION ANSWER ME NOW!</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: Don’t answer - objection -!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Objection overruled. The Prisoner will answer
the question.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I cannot deny it.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You were demoted…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: For insubordination.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I have on occasion disobeyed orders.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: And you were obeying or disobeying orders the
night you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: I object -!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I was unaware of the assassination until I
boarded his ship!</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Well, I -</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS
One and shot the Chancellor?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did
not witness.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Captain Kirk, are you aware that under
Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for
the actions of his men?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: So if it should prove members of your crew
did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Jim! They’re setting us up! Your honors, I
protest-!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The defendant will be silent! Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of
the crew under my command.</p>
<p><strong>chang</strong>: Your honors, the State rests.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Is it our turn, now?</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: According to Klingon law both
sides present their cases at the same time; we’ve HAD our turn.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: It is the judgment of this court that the
defendants are guilty as charged.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Captain James T. Kirk, Doctor Leonard
McCoy…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have either of you anything to say before
this court passes sentence?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: We were framed.</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: I wish to note for the record that
the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial. I beg the
court to consider this when framing its sentence.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: So noted. In view of Colonel Worf’s plea, the
sentence of death is commuted. It is the judgment of this court that
without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place
to the Dilithium Mines on the penal asteroid archipelago of Rura Penthe,
there to spend the rest of your natural lives.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Rura Penthe!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Known throughout the galaxy as the Aliens’
graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Better to kill them now and get it over
with…</p>

<p><strong>chekov</strong>: It is Enterprise. We fired.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: It’s na possible!! All weapons VISUALLY
accounted for. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Commander? This is most difficult to
say, but has it occurred to… to any of us… that the Captain is… that is,
we know his feelings about Klingons, what they did to his…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Well, it IS possible.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Hold.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: An ancestor of mine maintained that if you
eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: What exactly does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: It means that if we cannot have fired those
torpedoes then someone else did.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They dinna fire on themselves. And there
were no other ships present.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: There was an enormous neutron energy
surge.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Not from us!</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: A neutron surge that big could only be
produced by another ship…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: KRONOS One?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps…
underneath us…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: If another ship had been beneath us the
Klingons would’ve seen her!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Would they?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: A Bird of Prey!</p>
<p><strong>ckekov</strong>: Cloaked!?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: A Bird of Prey canna fire when she’s
cloaked!</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: This one can.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: They you’re talking about a dreadful new
engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I believe I am.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: We must inform Starfleet Command -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Inform them of what? A new weapon that isn’t
visible? Raving lunatics - that’s what they’ll call us! They’ll say
we’re so desperate to exonerate the Captain we’ll say anything -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: And they’d be right. We have no evidence -
just a theory that happens to fit the facts…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Even assuming you’re correct, Mr. Spock, why
would they fire on their own President?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I want this ship searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room
and work your way outwards…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Aye, sir -</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: I do not understand. If there was a ship
underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not
Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You’re forgetting something. the data banks
say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn’t, whoever
altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we’re searching for is
here…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You tell them, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Two pairs of gravity boots.</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: This is Rura Penthe. Observe: there is
no stockade, no guard tower, no electrified frontier. They are not
needed. Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming. Your new home is
underground.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: NO! NOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: Punishment means EXILE from prison to
the surface - on the surface nothing can survive.</p>
<p><strong>commandant</strong>: Below no one can escape. Work well and
you will be treated well. Work badly and you will die.</p>
<p><strong>alien</strong>: Quog wok na pushnat.</p>

<p><strong>alien</strong>: Quog wok na pushnat!!</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: If this is your spot, we’ll move on…</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood
of Aliens.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: He’s got it.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: And your coat.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Fraid not. It wouldn’t fit him, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Krandog aranty.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Fendo pompsky.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What’s the Brotherhood of Aliens?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Prisoners from outside the Klingon system.
They tend to band together. I’m Martia.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: This’ll help keep you warm. You’re Kirk and
McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How did you know…?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: There’s a reward for your death.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’ve been set up all along.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: We don’t get many presidential
assassins.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We didn’t kill Gorkon.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there
wants you out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I don’t believe we can get more out of the
way than this.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: They’ll make it look like an accident…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What are you in for, if you don’t mind me
asking?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: I don’t mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from
Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: How much time’s left of your sentence?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Don’t you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is
here for life.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Any progress?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: We’ve got a crew of three hundred
turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among
them. Surely they’ve disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn’t it have
been logical to leave them on Gorkon’s ship?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity
hadn’t been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they
would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Why not simply vaporize them?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: As you know, sir, no one can fire an
unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Suppose when they returned they threw
the boots into the garbage?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’m having the garbage searched. If my
surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers’ necks like
Tiberian bats. They couldn’t make their escape without them; nor can
they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they’re here.
Somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Did someone shoot off a phaser?
Mr. Spock.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’ve pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and
Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp
drive?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with the bloody -</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: - could take weeks, sir.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to
spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their
incriminating footwear.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: A lie?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: An error.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: I’ll tell them someone threw a gravity boot
into it…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Right, a gravity boot in the warp
drive…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: You understand that we have lost all contact
with Captain Kirk…?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: At present, he’s surrounded by a magnetic
shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his
escape planning by this time.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: They’ll respect him now…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: That’s a comfort…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I was lucky that thing had knees.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: That’s not his knee. Not everybody keeps
their genitals in the same place, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Anything else you want to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, why don’t you see what you can do? Let
them know we’re not holding a grudge.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Suppose HE’S holding a grudge?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: When whoever it is makes their move, you
won’t be here to ask if he’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There’s gotta be a way out of this place…</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Come in…?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet
urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of
Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Apparently they’re refusing to acknowledge
signal to return to spacedock, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Signal Starfleet that… we have no idea
location of Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: You having hearing problems, mister?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Three months till retirement. What a way to
finish.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: We’re not finished.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Speak for yourself. One day… one night…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: - <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bones, are you afraid of the future?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: That was the general idea I intended to
convey.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I didn’t mean this future.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Are we playing multiple choice?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what
MIGHT happen; I was frightened, really frightened.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Specifically of…?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating
Klingons… that’s why I failed in our assignment. It never even occurred
to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Well, don’t be too hard on yourself - we all
felt exactly the same -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I’m
starting to understand why.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Well, if you’ve got any bright ideas, now’s
the time to -</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Kirk? It’s me, Martia.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura
Penthe.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Except us.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: It IS possible.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: I know how to get outside the shield.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Where do we come in?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: Getting outside the shield is easy. After
that it’s up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can
you?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: I can’t make it alone. You’re the likeliest
candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Candidate for what?</p>
<p><strong>martia</strong>: A partnership. Go to “C” Lift in the morning
for mining duty. I’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What is it with you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Still think we’re finished?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: More than ever.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Klingon blood.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: They must have walked through it when it was
floating and tracked it back here.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: This is the first evidence that corroborates
our theory.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Now we go to Starfleet?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Now we expand our search to include
uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: ALL uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye, sir… ALL uniforms…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Mister Chekov.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The longer we take, the greater danger in
which we leave the Captain and Doctor McCoy.</p>

<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe’s deep in Klingon
territory. If we’re discovered…</p>

is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity.

We’re outside the shield. Now it’s your turn, Kirk.</p>

where did she get these convenient clothes? And don’t tell me that flare
is standard prison issue…</p>

<p><strong>spock</strong>: You must have cursed yourself, for having
programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something
wrong aboard Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: She programmed the torpedo hits?</p>
<p><strong>spock’s voice over</strong>: But she was unable to erase them
from Mr. Scott’s inventory. The computers contradicted each other…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You were clever about the boots, Lieutenant -

<p><strong>spock</strong>: But it was when you tried to persuade me the
Captain was guilty that I should have understood.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: You can’t prove any of this…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Oh yes I can. At my trial my personal log was

<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I tried to tell you… you wouldn’t

<p><strong>spock</strong>: Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well
that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too -
about having faith.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: You’ve betrayed the Federation - all of
you.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What do you think YOU’VE been doing?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Saving Starfleet. Klingons can’t be
trusted, sir, you said so yourself. They killed your son. They conspired
with us to assassinate their own Chancellor. You’d make peace with
them?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Who is “US?”</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I won’t allow Starfleet to be dismantled
over some Klingon promises.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Starfleet will be around long enough for me to
convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it
will be on your record.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Admiral Donald.</p>

<p><strong>scotty</strong>: This is incredible -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: WHO ELSE…?</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Are you all so naive? Everyone who
stands to lose from Peace. Who manufactures photon torpedoes?</p>
<p><strong>munitions businessman</strong>: No one wants a war.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Who spends millions developing the new
Klingon cloaking device? The universe was a well-ordered place! We all
knew our roles! Why change them?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Are you telling us Klingons and Federation
members are conspiring TOGETHER…?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: In a sick way I suppose it represents
progress…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The peace conference.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What peace conference?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at
a undisclosed location to continue her father’s work… the conspirators
obviously intend to try again…</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: We can send a message to Starfleet Command
-</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: I do not think so. Enterprise has
disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will
make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Where IS the conference?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: She’s only a cog in the wheel - no way she
knows that.</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: And no way you’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Then we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I’ve been dead before. Uhura, raise
Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Why would they give them to us?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: The Commander is an old friend of yours.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: What was it like - being dead?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Sulu!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Standing by, Captain Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You understand that by even talking to us,
you’re violating regulations, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I’m sorry, Captain - your message is breaking
up.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Bless you, Sulu. Where’s the peace conference?
They’re going to attempt another assassination.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the
Romulan border. I’m sending the exact coordinates on a coded
frequency.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m afraid we may need more than that. There’s
a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she’s
cloaked.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Surely not.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I’m telling you. Hang on. How many of those
things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you’re charged with murder…</p>
<p><strong>lt. saavik</strong>: Just the prototype.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: I’m getting underway now. But you should know,
I’m in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time
are slim.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: When does this conference start?</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: According to my information, today.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Thank you, Captain Sulu.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Don’t mention it, Captain Kirk.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: You realize you’ve just committed
treason, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: To be candid, I always hoped that if the
choice ever came down to betraying my country or betraying my friend,
I’d have the guts to betray my country. Warp nine, mister.</p>

<p><strong>spock</strong>: You were right: it was arrogant presumption
that got us into this situation. You might have died.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.
You know, you’re a great one for logic. I’m a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread. We’re both extremists. Reality is probably
somewhere in between us.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: I was blind. I couldn’t see past the death of
my son. I couldn’t trust.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did
nothing. I trusted too much.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You couldn’t have known she was listening the
night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her
achievements as a Vulcan.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Gorkon had to die before I understood how
prejudiced I was…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Can we two have grown so old and inflexible
that we have outlived our usefulness? Would that constitute a joke?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Someone said the difference between comic and
cosmic is the letter “S.” You haven’t outlived your usefulness - to me.
And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I SHOULD have been -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not for the actions of another. No one is
responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: But I am not human. I am only -</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Spock, you want to know something?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Everyone’s human. We’re too old to play games.
We’re only human.</p>

<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Captain, when we get to Camp Khitomer, how
will we defend ourselves? I mean, if this new Bird of Prey can fire
while she is invisible…?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Now there’s a poser.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I do not think anxiety is called for.
According to my calculations we have another five minutes and twenty-two
seconds to figure something out.</p>

<p><strong>ufp president</strong>: Madam Chancellor, members of the
diplomatic corps, honored guests: the United Federation of Planets
welcomes you to Camp Khitomer. Now that we are assembled, I move we
conclude these ceremonies and get down to business. Madam
Chancellor?</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: Agreed.</p>

<p><strong>ufp president</strong>: We are gathered here today in high
hopes, believing that differing civilizations of good will can work
together to overcome intolerance. We believe that with understanding and
patience it will be possible to resolve what separates us. Let us
redefine progress to mean that just because we CAN do a thing it does
not necessarily follow that we MUST do that thing.</p>
<p><strong>ufp president</strong>: We believe that the responsibility
for destiny rests squarely on our own shoulders…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: She’s here - somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: But if she’s cloaked…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Then all we’ve got is a neutron radiation
surge - and by the time we’re close enough to record it, we’re
ashes…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Captain, perhaps we’re going about this the
wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop
us.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Make ourselves a target?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Shields. Battle stations.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Shields up. Battle stations.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only,
one half impulse power…</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye, sir; thrusters…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Uhura?</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Nothing, Captain. If they’re here, they’re
rigger for silent running.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: If she fires, she has a perfectly valid
excuse. We’re a renegade ship coming dangerously close to two heads of
state during a vital interstellar conference.</p>

<p><strong>chang</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: What’s she waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Probably trying to figure out why we’re
reversing, wondering if we detect her.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Incoming.</p>

<p><strong>helmsman</strong>: She’ll fly apart…!</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Fly her apart, then!</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: … many people speculated about my father’s
motives. There were those who said he was an idealist, driven by
visionary notions; others said he had no choice, that he was a pragmatic
technocrat, making the best of a devastating situation. Great men are
seldom good men. The truth is my father was both: a pragmatist and an
idealist. If Praxis hadn’t exploded, then quite possibly his idealism
would not have found expression. Nor would mine. We are a proud race. We
are here because we want to go on being proud… if we cannot make war, we
will make peace…</p>

<p><strong>169 ext. space 169</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Captain, we can’t see her, but she gives off
heat…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Not from a distance. She won’t show up on ANY
type of scan.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Too bad we can’t SMELL her.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: In space, no one can hear you sweat.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s a pity Starships were never equipped with
bloodhounds…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I don’t think Starfleet could have envisioned
our current predicament.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Maybe we should write them a letter?</p>
<p><strong>scotty’s voice</strong>: Better post date it.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: Under impulse power she expends fuel like any
other ship. We call it “Plasma” - I do not know the Klingon name for it,
but by any name it is merely ionized gas.</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: Well, what about all that atmospheric
equipment we’re carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: I’m going to perform surgery on a torpedo -
you never know…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: You may need assistance, doctor…</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Fascinating…</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward,
thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: Aye, sir; thrusters…</p>

<p><strong>bones</strong>: We’ve got a full confession.</p>
<p><strong>sulu</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kerla</strong>: And you.</p>
<p><strong>president azetbur</strong>: What’s the meaning of this?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: It’s about the future, Madam Chancellor. Some
people think the future means the end of history.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: But we haven’t run out of history just yet.
Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - “the undiscovered
country”…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: I always assumed Hamlet meant death.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might
mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened
of change. I know I was.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: There’s an old expression: it takes one to
know one.</p>
<p><strong>azetbur</strong>: You’ve restored my father’s faith.</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: You’ve restored my son’s.</p>
<p><strong>198 ext. space 198</strong>: VFX VFX</p>
<p><strong>uhura</strong>: They might as well arrest me, too; I felt
like Lieutenant Saavik.</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: But you didn’t join a conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: They don’t arrest people for having
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>chekov</strong>: If they did we’d all have to turn ourselves
in. How CAN we rely on them?</p>
<p><strong>kirk</strong>: The only way to find out if a man’s
trustworthy…</p>
<p><strong>spock</strong>: … is to trust him.</p>

Captain Kirk. Take care.</p>

Once again, we’ve saved civilization as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: And the good news is they’re not going to
prosecute.</p>

Stardate 8769.24. This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise
under my command. This ship and her history will shortly become the care
of a new generation. To them and their posterity will we commit our
future. They will continue the voyages we have begun and journey to ALL
the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man… where no ONE has
gone before.</p>
