<h1 id="gods-and-monsters">gods-and-monsters</h1>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’d have more peace of mind if the live-in
nurse were still here.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: She was nothing but bother. I not like her,
Mr. Jimmy not like her. We do better if you live-in again,
Mr. David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ll contact me if there’s an
emergency?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes, I call you at this number. Mr. Jimmy?
More coffee?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What? Oh yes. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Isn’t Hanna a peach?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: She tells me you haven’t been sleeping
well.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It’s the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If
I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don’t, my mind
seems to go off in a hundred directions at once –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Then take the pills.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I wanted to be alert for your visit today.
Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two
difficult stars –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: “The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves
but in our stars.”</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You remember how a production eats up one’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, David. There’s no pleasure in making you
feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You’ll be late for that
aeroplane.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: By the way, I like the Renoir.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Goodbye, Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>sarah whale</strong>: Stop lagging behind, Jimmy. We’ll be
late for church.</p>
<p><strong>young whale</strong>: Yes, Mum.</p>
<p><strong>william whale</strong>: Straighten up, son.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hanna? Who’s the new yardman?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while
you were in the hospital. He came cheap.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The bells of hell go ting-a-ling For you but
not for me. Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy
victory?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My name is Whale. This is my house.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Nice place.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: And your name is –?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Boone. Clayton Boone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I couldn’t help but notice your tattoo. That
phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just that I was in the Marines.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The Marines. Good for you. You must have
served in Korea.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you
Yanks call it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah. I better get on with my work.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: When you’re through, Mr. Boone, feel free to
make use of the pool. We’re quite informal here. You don’t have to worry
about a suit.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No thanks. I got another job to get to this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Some other time, perhaps? Keep up the fine
work.</p>
<p><strong>sarah whale</strong>: Jimmy. The privy needs cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I have my class tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sarah whale</strong>: Don’t get above yarself, Jimmy. Leave
the drawring to the artists.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Quite so, mum. To the privy.</p>
<p><strong>sarah whale</strong>: “Quite so.” Jimmy Whale. Who are ya to
put on airs?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber
sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many
years. Very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t be daft. It’s just a student from the
university.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Mr. Kay, sir.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Ah, Mr. Kay. I’d almost forgotten. My guest
for tea.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You’re one of
my favorite all-time directors. I can’t believe I’m meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. I expect you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: And this is your house. Wow. The house of
Frankenstein. I thought you’d live in a spooky old mansion or villa.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: One likes to live simply.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I know. People’s movies aren’t their lives.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Love dead. Hate living.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That’s my favorite line in my favorite movie of
yours. “Bride of Frankenstein.”</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Is it now? Hanna? I think we’ll take our tea
down by the swimming pool.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: After you then.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I love the great horror films. And yours are
the best. “The Old Dark House.” “The Invisible Man.” They look great and
have style. And funny!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: This is the studio where I paint.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Nice. And your lighting and camera angles.
You’re got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like
it.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Time for you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Everything. Start at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I was born outside London, the only son of a
minister who was a master at Harrow. Grandfather was a bishop. Church
of…Church of Eng…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Your father was a schoolmaster?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course. I attended Eton – it wouldn’t do
for a master’s son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to
Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you
know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You can’t imagine what life was like after
the Armistice. The twenties in London were one long bank holiday, a
break from everything dour and respectable. I had a knack with pencil
and paper, so I was hired to design sets for stage productions.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Thank you, Hanna. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You can go now.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: There was one play in particular, a
beautiful, grim study of war called “Journey’s End”. Every experienced
director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for
the job. “Journey’s End” made the careers of everyone associated with
it. It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: How much longer before we get to
“Frankenstein”?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it’s
not me you’re interested in, only my horror pictures?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made
twenty pictures in all –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas
were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand
guignol for the masses.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: But it’s the horror movies you’ll be remembered
for.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: No. I never said you were. Or will be soon.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: So. “Journey’s End” brought you to Hollywood
–</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of
questioning is getting old, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Let’s make it more interesting. I will answer
any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article
of clothing.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That’s funny, Mr. Whale.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It is, isn’t it? My life as a game of strip
poker. Shall we play?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re serious.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Then the rumors are true?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What rumors might those be?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That you were forced to retire because, uh – a
sex scandal.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to
answer a question of that magnitude, you’ll have to remove both your
shoes and your socks.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re a dirty old man.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You are kind to indulge your elders in their
vices. As I indulge the young in theirs.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. There was no scandal.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My only other vice. I suppose you’d like a
fuller answer to your question.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It will cost you your sweater.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Too warm for a sweater, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You must understand how Hollywood was twenty
years ago. Nobody cared a tinker’s cuss who slept with whom, so long as
you kept it out of the papers. Outside of Hollywood, who knows who
George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt
shops along Santa Monica?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: George Cukor? Who made “A Star Is Born”? I
never guessed.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Take off your vest and I’ll tell you a
story.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t be shy. There’s time to stop before you
go too far.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: George is famous for his Saturday dinner
parties. Great artists, writers, society folk, all rubbing elbows with
Hollywood royalty. But how many of those oh-so-proper people know about
the Sunday brunches that follow? Gatherings of trade eating leftovers,
followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool. If a goat like
that can continue about his business, my more domestic arrangements
could’ve raised very few eyebrows.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Can we talk about the horror movies now?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in
particular you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Will you tell me everything you remember about
making “Frankenstein”?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Can that count as one question?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I can’t believe I’m doing this.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Just like going swimming, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Maybe you’d like a swim when we’re through. I
never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Okay. “Frankenstein.” Tell me everything.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Righto. Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Universal wanted me for another story, and
wanted me so baldly – I mean badly, not baldly. I was given the pick of
stories being developed, and I picked that one.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Who came up with the Monster’s makeup and
look?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My idea. Muchly. My sketches. Big heavy brow.
Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the
new, like tinned beef.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: He’s one of the great images of the twentieth
century. As important as the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You think so? That’s very kind –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Boris Karloff. Where did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Karloff, Mr. Whale. How did you cast him?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Please. Excuse me. I must go lie –</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mr. Whale? Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I just need to – lie down. Studio. Daybed in
studio.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh my God. What’s wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your
heart?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Head. Not heart.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Water. Glasses at the sink.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Which ones? I bring them all.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Luminal.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Mr. Kay. You’re not dressed.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I was going to take a swim.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m sorry I spoiled it for you. You should
probably go home.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You must think I’m terrible, Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I do not think you anything anymore. Just
back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack
had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Perhaps we should get you uphill before the
pills knock you cold.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. Let me lie here. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Boone! You awake? Eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You told me to get you up, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m up. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hasta la vista, Boone. And give the jail
bait a squeeze for me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hey, um…Rose –</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: My name is Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Time to go, Daisy.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You know. I could help you fix up this place
real nice.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Don’t you have to be somewhere? Like high
school maybe.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: I gave it up for Lent.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Right. Time to hit the road, kid.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The bells of hell go ting-a-ling…</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Everything alright, Mr. Boone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb
you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down
iced tea. I’d like it very much if you’d join me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I stink to high heaven right now.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The honest sweat of one’s brow. I assure you
I won’t be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Or would you prefer a beer?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. Iced tea’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Splendid.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Come in, Mr. Boone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My workshop, my studio. Hardly somewhere in
which a sweaty workman should feel out of place.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: These are your paintings?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What? Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Excuse me, but – are you famous?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You know what they say. If you have to ask
–</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of
these look familiar.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: They were familiar when I painted them. That
one’s copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years
ago. And that’s a Rembrandt.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: They’re just copies then. Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But before I retired, you might say I had a
brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion
pictures?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I’d go
with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No,
I was merely a director here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah? What were some of your movies?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: This and that. The only ones you maybe have
heard of are the “Frankenstein” pictures.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: “Frankenstein” and “Bride of” and “Son of” and
all the rest?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I made only the first two. The others were
done by hacks.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of
famous movies like those.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Merely comfortable. Here’s Hanna with our
refreshments. Can you get the door?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your
mind today?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My mind’s lovely. And yours?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You remember what the doctor tells us.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in
for a glass of tea. We’ll have a brief chat and he’ll finish the
yard.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I am not forgetting your last brief chat.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Just go. We can manage without you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He looks plenty big. You won’t need my help
if anything goes flooey.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: When they stay in your employ too long,
servants begin to think they’re married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What did she mean by going flooey?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I returned recently from a stay in
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.
But you have a marvelous head.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you
ever modeled?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You mean, like posed for pictures?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Sat for an artist. Been sketched.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’s to sketch?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You have the most architectural skull. And
your nose. Very expressive.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Broke is more like it.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But expressively broken. How did it
happen?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Football in college.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You went to university?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just a year. I dropped out to join the
Marines.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes. You were a Marine.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I apologize for going on like this. It’s the
Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It’s a
great deal to ask of someone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You mean – you really want to draw me?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Indeed. I’d pay for the privilege of drawing
your head.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Even an amateur artist needs a subject to
inspire him.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: And it’s just my head you want? Nothing
else?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What are you suggesting? You’ll charge extra
if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t want to draw pictures of me in my
birthday suit, right?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I
can assure you of that.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right then. Sure. I could use the extra
dough.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Excellent. We’ll have a most interesting
time.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: This is the area of infarction. By which
we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: You’re a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever
damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively
unimpaired.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up?
What’s my story there?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to explain.</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: The central nervous system selects items
from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke
appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now
seem to be firing at random.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’re saying there’s an electrical storm in
my head?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: That’s as good a way as any to describe
it. I’ve seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks
down memory lane.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But the rest of it? The killing headaches.
The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a
hundred things at once. It’s all nothing more than bad electricity?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: In a manner of speaking. I’ve never
encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I’m sure they’re
related.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: So what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>dr. payne</strong>: Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever
you feel an attack coming on.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You seem to be saying that this isn’t just a
case of resting until I’m better. That my condition will continue to
deteriorate until the end of my life.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Don’t worry, you already paid me. I’m here
because –</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The Master is waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He’s down in his studio. Here. Take this with
you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s your job, lady, not mine. I’m here so he
can draw my picture.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I’m keeping away. What you are doing is no
business of mine.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What kind of man are you? Are you a good
man?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah, I’m a good man. Something make you think
I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You will not hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Gimme a break. I’m going to sit on my ass
while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say.
Here. I will take the tray.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Very good, Hanna. Now goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m sure you’d like something to wet your
whistle while I work.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: We’ll go slowly today. Since this is your
first time as a model.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Did you see this? They’re showing one of your
movies tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You don’t say? Which picture?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: “Bride of Frankenstein.”</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hmmm. I much prefer “Show Boat” or “The
Invisible Man.” Shall we begin?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Ready when you are.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That shirt, Mr. Boone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s new.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s too white, too distracting.
Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not wearing an undershirt.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I’m not your Aunt
Tilly.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: But it’s just my face you want to draw.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh if it’s going to make you uncomfortable…
Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: We could wrap this like a toga around your
shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right already. I’ll take it off. Kind of
warm in here anyway.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes. Much better. Here.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I think we’ll have you sit slightly sideways,
so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair. Yes. Just so.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Take a picture, it lasts longer.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That’s exactly what I intend to do.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You seem to have no idea how handsome you
are, Mr. Boone. It has to do with how snugly your face fits your
skull.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel
free to remove your boots and socks.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It’s a bit like being at the doctor, isn’t
it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize
you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this
country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like
butter on bread.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sounds like something you feed the dog.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it.
We kept ours in a crockery jar.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Your family ate dripping?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course not. As I said, only poor people
–</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m sorry. I’ve just realized how terribly
ironic it all is.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’ve spent most of my life outrunning my
past. Now it’s flooding all over me.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: There’s something about the openness of your
face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping.
Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are
you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We weren’t rich. But we weren’t poor
either.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No, you were middle class, like all
Americans.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I guess you’d say we lived on the wrong side
of the tracks.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks
than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if
you forget, there’s always someone to remind you. My family had no
doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a
freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get
that? Certainly not from them.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: They took me out of school when I was
fourteen and put me in a factory. They meant no harm. They were like a
family of farmers who’ve been given a giraffe, and don’t know what to do
with the creature except harness him to the plow.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hatred was the only thing that kept my soul
alive in that soul-killing place. And among those men I hated was my own
poor, dumb father. Who put me in that hell to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my
stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t mind. I’m not crazy about my old man
either.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Why don’t we break for five minutes? You
probably want to stretch your legs.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: So you just sat there while this old limey
banged his gums?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I liked it. You learn stuff listening to
old-timers.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You ever hear of this Whale fellow?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can’t say that I have. Can’t say I’ve heard
of a lot of people though.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: If you don’t believe me, let’s watch this
movie. See if his name’s on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn
movie?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I told you. I don’t turn on the TV except for
the fights.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: A spooky movie. Just what this place needs
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Couldn’t make it any deader, doll. Set me
up.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sure. Your friend want one?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Yeah, one for what’s-his-name here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Thanks, doll.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be
grateful Boone’s not cutting Shirley Temple’s lawn.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Jesus, Boone. You come in here proud as a
peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture. We’re just
bringing you back to earth.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sounds screwy to me. I can’t imagine a real
artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: This kisser wasn’t so bad you couldn’t lay
under it a few times.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ooooh.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I bet this is just some fruit pretending to
be famous. So he can get in the big guy’s pants.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Ooooh.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just thinking out loud.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right, then. He’s interested in you for
your conversation. We know what a great talker you are.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not anymore you don’t. Doll.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We’re watching the movie, Harry. You got that!
We are watching my fucking movie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Calm down, Clay. Just calm down. We’ll watch
it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Good. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Right there. What did I tell you? James
Whale.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This looks corny.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Go wash glasses if you don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Not bad. Two down and it’s just started.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Wonderful old Una. Gobbling like an old
turkey hen.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Oh, that monster. How could you be working
with him?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t be silly, Hanna. He’s a very proper
actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: These old movies are such a hoot. They
thought they were being scary, but they’re just funny.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Maybe it’s supposed to be funny.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don’t
mix them.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hey! Some of us are watching a movie!</p>
<p><strong>saylor</strong>: Go ahead. Free country.</p>
<p><strong>saylor</strong>: You want me to turn it down?</p>
<p><strong>saylor</strong>: Hey, I didn’t know. It’s your favorite
movie. Sorry, okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re like a dog with a bone over this
movie, Clay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I just want to watch it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He is not going to kill the old man?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No, Hanna. My heart isn’t that black.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The cigars were my own brand. So that I could
have the leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sick stuff. Necrophilia. I wonder if they
knew how sick they were.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The Monster’s lonely and he wants a friend, a
girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right! You don’t want him.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: She is horrible.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: She is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Ugh. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy, but your movie is
not my teacup. Still, I am glad there is a happy ending. The bad people
are dead and the good people live.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Weird movie. Weird, weird, weird.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So what did you think?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Weird.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: I loved it. I want a switch like that in my
trailer, so I can blow us to kingdom come when things don’t go my
way.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Damn but it’s getting drunk in here. Late
too. The bride of Dwight is going to bite my head off.</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: You coming, Boone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I think I’ll hang around.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go home, Clay. We’re closing up.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I thought I’d give you a hand since I kept you
open.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m next door if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You know what? I think you guys are all
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s to be jealous of?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’ve gotten to know someone who’s famous.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not so famous any of us have ever heard of
him.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: If he were that famous, he probably wouldn’t
give me the time of day. This way, he’s like my famous person. Yeah, my
own personal famous person. Who treats me like I’m somebody worth
talking to.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You want to go for a swim?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It means it’s too cold to go swimming. And I
don’t mean the water.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I wasn’t going to try anything.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, and I’m never going to smoke another
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Let’s go for a walk at least. Walk and talk. I
really feel like talking tonight.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: This old guy – he’s the kind of person I
expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who’s done things with
his life.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you realize you’re more interested in this
old goober than you ever were in me?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s different. He’s a man. And by the way you
have no business calling him a homo.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It never crossed your mind?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He’s an artist. Anyway, he’s too old to think
about sex.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All the old men I know think about nothing
but sex.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: C’mon. What’s eating you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You picked up that girl right in front of
me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Hey, no strings, right? That’s what you always
said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It still hurt. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I’m actually kind of glad it happened. It
made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull
me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You liked it too.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sure. I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: If you enjoy it, you should do it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You know, I just can’t do that anymore. I
still have time to get things right. Get married again –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You mean us?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The look on your face! You’re not marriage
material. You’re not even boyfriend material. You’re a kid. A big, fun,
slightly irresponsible kid.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not a kid.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What are you then? What will you be ten years
from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your
trailer?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I like my life. I’m a free man.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sure you’re free, for now at least. But how
long before you’re just alone? Pathetic and alone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So you don’t want to fuck. That’s what you’re
telling me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is that all this conversation means to you?
Am I going to put out or not?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Damn straight. I’m sick of playing games.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Betty, look. This is coming out all wrong
–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: From here on out, Boone, you’re just another
tired old face on the other side of the bar.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s all shit! Shit on by women! Shit on by
the Marines. Shit on by the world! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fuuuck!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’ll be fine, Hanna. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Oh no, Mr. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: You done yet, love? I am absolutely
dying for a fag.</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: Goo’ ’orning, ’ames.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Good morning. And a very good morning to
you.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Uh-oh. The way you look at me,
James. What have you done this time?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her
visage.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Boris? Do I look a fright?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Behold, the Bride of Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Oh, James.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: And you said there’d be some of me
left. Nobody’s going to know me in this getup.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Nonsense, my dear. You look extraordinary.
Today’s script. Quick. And a pencil.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Jack, I want to get on this right away.
Sorry, Boris, we won’t get to you until this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: I ’ish you ’old ’e ’ooner.</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: I could have spent the morning
tending to my roses.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: My God. Is the audience to presume
that Colin and I have done her hair? I thought we were mad scientists,
not hairdressers.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Only a mad scientist could do this
to a woman.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: Oh no, my dear. You look absolutely
amazing. There’s no way I can compete with you. The scene is yours.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: In the sequel, James, two lady
scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary
Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: I would’ve thought Mr. Leslie
Howard would be more your line.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: More your line.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin
Tin. Dogs are so much more dependable than men.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Colin? Please. It’s time. How is he
today?</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: Stiff as a board. Yes, Colin. Come
see what they’ve done to our Elsa.</p>
<p><strong>colin clive</strong>: I’m not at my best today, Jimmy. A
touch of flu, you know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Relax, my boy. You could do this scene in
your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: I gather we not only did her hair
but dressed her. What a couple of queens we are, Colin.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes, a couple of flaming queens. And
Pretorius is a little in love with Dr. Frankenstein, you know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes. I think it’s coming together. Shall we
have a go?</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: Quiet on the set!</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: Lights!</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: Sound!</p>
<p><strong>sound man</strong>: Okay for sound.</p>
<p><strong>assistant director</strong>: Camera!</p>
<p><strong>camera assistant</strong>: Scene two-fifteen. Take one.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Action.</p>
<p><strong>ernest thesiger</strong>: The Bride of Frankenstein!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Luminal. Illumine all.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It isn’t working. The experiment is a
failure.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m up, Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What in God’s name –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I told you to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Does the yardman come today?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Of course. This afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Something I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The Master wants to know if you are free for
lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I
ask.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Got a lawn this afternoon, but I’m free until
then.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Expect nothing fancy.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The Master is dressing. I am to offer you a
drink. There is whiskey and there is iced tea.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Tea is fine.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. You are a guest now. You go in the living
room.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: That’s okay, Hanna. I’m more comfortable in
here. It is Hanna, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How long you worked for Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Long enough. Fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I bet you’ve seen a lot of famous people come
and go? Movie stars?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People
come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have
people, Boone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Your wife?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not married.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Because no girl in her right
mind will have me?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: A man who is not married has nothing. He is a
man of trouble. You need a woman.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You proposing what I think you’re proposing?
Don’t you think I’m a little young for you?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Men. Always pulling legs. Everything is
comedy. “How very amusing. How marvelously droll.”</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You ever been married, Hanna?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Of course. I am married still.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Yeah? What’s your husband do?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He is dead now, twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Then you’re as single as I am.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. I have children, grandchildren too. I
visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do
not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he
will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: This is what the priests tell me. His sins of
the flesh will keep him from heaven.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The
deed no man can name without shame?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What is the good English? All I know is
bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: A homo?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes! You know?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That is why he must go to hell. I do not
think it fair. But God’s law is not for us to judge.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You did not know?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Well…no, not really –</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You and he are not doing things?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Good. That is what I hope. I did not think
you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not going to hurt anyone.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Yes. I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You must go in. Quickly. He will not like to
think I have had you in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free
for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I assume you worked up an appetite with your
labor.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Forgive my rudeness. At my age, the post is
the cream of the day.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hmmm? Princess Margaret?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Her Majesty’s Loyal Subjects in the Motion
Picture Industry… Cordially invited…Reception at the home of…Mr. George
Cukor!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That pushy little – horning in on the Queen’s
sister, then offering to share her with the whole damn raj? I live in
this country to get away from this rubbish!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Is this David’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: This David’s a friend?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse
me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no
mind and expect them to return the compliment. Lunch should be ready.
Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Smells lovely, Hanna.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Saw your movie the other night. Watched it
with some friends.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Did you now?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I liked it. We all did.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Did anyone laugh?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why? Was it supposed to be funny?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course. I had to make it interesting for
myself, you see. A comedy about death. The trick is not to ruin it for
anyone who isn’t in on the joke. But the Monster never receives any of
my gibes. He is noble. Noble and misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: In Korea, Mr. Boone?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Did you kill anyone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t like to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It’s nothing to be ashamed of, in the service
of one’s country. That’s something to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill
someone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true
test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. I could have, though.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes, I believe you could. How free is your
schedule this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then
another lawn out by La Cienega.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could
you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Can’t today.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’ll pay our going rate. Plus what you’d get
if you did the hedges.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sorry. I don’t feel like sitting still
today.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: All righty. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Use this.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Just a trim. And mine while you’re at it.
Fingers are a bit stiff today.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You ever been married, Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. At least not in the legal sense.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: So you had a wife?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Or a husband. Depending on which of us you
asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Does that surprise you?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No, I – you’re a homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh dear. If one must have a clinical
name.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not, you know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I never thought you were.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t think of me that way, do you?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What way might that be?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You know. Look at me like – like I look at
women.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. I know a real man like
you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides,
you’re not my type.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: So we understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What you do is no business of mine. Live and
let live, I say.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I hope this has nothing to do with your
refusing to sit for me today?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. I –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What are you afraid of, Mr. Boone? Certainly
not a frail old man like me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Can I see what you did so far?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It will only make you self-conscious. You’ll
have to remove your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sorry. Not today.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But we have to match the other sketch.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.
You just said you didn’t want me self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Perhaps if we open the shirt and pull –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh dear. I have made you nervous.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m fine. I’d just rather keep it on.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down
around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two
little buttons.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No! Look. What you told me at lunch is still
very weird for me. So either you sketch me like I am or I’ll say forget
it and go do your hedges.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t mean to be a prick, but that’s how I
feel.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course. I don’t want to scare you off. Not
before I’m finished with you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You
have a steady companion?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Not at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just
to get a piece of it.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Very well put.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The world is just one kiss-ass game after
another. A man has to make up his own life, alone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Ah. A philosopher.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Thoreau with a lawnmower.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone.
Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad
thing.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Is that why you and your friend split up?
Because you wanted to be free?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it’s why
I stopped making pictures.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You might not think it to look at me now, but
there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The
horror movies were behind me. I’d done “Show Boat.” Major success. Great
box office. Now I was to do something important. “The Road Back.” An
indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was to be my
masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937,
Hitler’s armies were already massing – and still the New York bankers
stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German
market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add
slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I
was blamed.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: After that, I went out of fashion. I was no
longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I
spend my time working in such a dreadful business?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It’s so far in the past now. Over fifteen
years –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Making movies was the most wonderful thing in
the world. Working with friends. Entertaining people. Yes, I suppose I
miss it. More so now that –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I think we all want to feel we’ve left our
mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’ve done a helluva lot more than most
people.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Better work.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But I chose freedom. David was still in the
thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn’t
fancy spending my golden years as merely “the friend.” The dirty little
secret of a nervous producer.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How long were you…?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play
whose run outlasted the cast’s ability to keep it fresh. So I finally
decided to close down the show.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: When all fetters are loosened, a certain
hedonism creeps in, don’t you think? There was a period when this house
was overrun with young men. Some even posed for me. Right where you’re
sitting now.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course, they weren’t nearly as bashful.
No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard,
arrogant pricks –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Fuck it. I can’t do this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Isn’t it enough you told me you’re a fairy? Do
you have to rub my nose in it?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and
that’s it. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Come on, Jimmy. Watch me dive.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I think I’ll just rest for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I think we’re ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’re up, Mr. Boone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The extras are in their places. Now we need
the star. Wouldn’t you like to get in the pool?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh no. I never swim.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’ll have to remove that shirt.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do you mind turning on a light? It’s getting
pretty soupy out here.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Should have been here when you said you
would. You whack off a tow, don’t think about taking me to court.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re lucky I even squeezed you in today.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Don’t take that tone with me, bub. There’s
Japs in this town that work cheaper and do flowers too.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Will you just turn on the porch light?
Sir?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Where’s Betty?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She took the night off. Heavy date. Some guy
she’s had her eye on for a while.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Thanks a lot, pal.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Dwight!</p>
<p><strong>dwight</strong>: Hey, Boone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Here are the trade newspapers you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Who was that at the door?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: A visitor.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Thank you, Hanna. That will be all.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Mr. Boone. You’re not due to cut the lawn
until Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’d like to sit for you again. But only if you
ease up on the locker room talk. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Scout’s honor.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to
come back?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I like your stories.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Everybody has stories to tell.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What about your stint in Korea? I’m sure it
was full of dramatic episodes.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I told you. I don’t like to talk about
that.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: And the fear you showed at our last session?
How did you overcome that?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Not fear. More like disgust.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of
the unknown – all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I
right in assuming that you’ve had little experience with men of my
persuasion?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: There’s no people like you in my crowd.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No teammates in football? No comrades in
Korea?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You must think the whole world is queer. Well
it’s not. War sure isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, there may not be atheists in the
foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re talking through your hat now.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You were a soldier?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I was an officer.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: This was World War I?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No, my dear. The Crimean War. What do you
think? The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: – a war without end. There were trenches when
I arrived, and trenches when I left, two years later. Just like in the
movies. Only the movies never get the stench of them. The world reduced
to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky. But we were
discussing something else. Oh yes. Love in the trenches.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.
He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me.
Unlike the others, he didn’t care that I was a workingman impersonating
his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved
me. But chastely, like a schoolboy.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Something happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I remember one morning in particular. A
morning when the sun came out.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Odd, how even there one could have days when
the weather was enough to make one happy. He and I were standing on the
fire step and I showed him the sights of no-man’s land, through the
periscope. It was beautiful. The barbed wire was reddish gold, the water
in the shell holes green with algae, the sky a clear quattrocento blue.
And I stood shoulder to shoulder with a tall apple-cheeked boy who loved
and trusted me.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t do this to me again, Mr. Boone. I
absolutely refuse.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You will not set me on another walk down
memory lane. Not this lane. Not today.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I
never even remembered it until you got me going.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re the one who started it.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’re very clever, Mr. Boone. You just sit
there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you’re thinking. What a
crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You asked me to model. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course I remember. Do you think I’m so
senile –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Stupid. Very stupid. What have I been
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Just go. Please. Why don’t you go?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t get it. First you creep me out with
homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you’re upset
because I listen? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I want – I want…</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I want a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: A touch of headache.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My apologies. I had no business snapping at
you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No harm done.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.
You cannot force what will not flow.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t want me to sit for you anymore?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: How would you like to come to a party with
me? A reception for Princess Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: If you don’t mind driving, I’d like to take
you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you
amused.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m game. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton?
Or do you prefer Boone?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Clayton is fine.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mom? Yeah, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No, I’m not in jail…I don’t want any money,
no… Look, is Sis there? I want to tell her about this movie person I met
out here. She’ll get a kick out of it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No, I still…I’d give you my phone number if I
had a phone –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: How’s the old man?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Time’s up. I better go.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’d hardly call our yardman a friend.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. But someone you can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Do you miss having someone to talk to,
Hanna?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course. How is the old boy these days?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed
cream fedora…</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It must be up in your old room. I will
look.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Gas masks on. Gas masks on.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Don’t mind me, Lieutenant. Save
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Oh, Mr. Jimmy. You make a mess of it.
Here.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: That is my daughter. She say she and her
husband are coming to town this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy. I will
make it short.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’ll be out this afternoon, remember? Your
family can visit as long as they like.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No. I do not cook for them. My daughter’s
no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You can toss this one in the trash.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Good afternoon, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do I look okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You look splendid, my boy. Quite
splendid.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I suppose you’d like the top down.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: If that’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Nothing would please me more.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Stars, you know. The suns of other
galaxies.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Good old George. He loves to put on the dog.
Only his dogs tend to have a bit of mutt.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What did I tell you? Listen.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to hire music.
There’s nothing but chin-wag. The cold dreary custard of English
chin-wag.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Slim pickings. Well, it’s early yet. Perhaps
this is a good time to pay our respects.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Let’s get this over with quickly.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: I had no idea you’d be here.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal
Highness?</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: Splendid. Now that I know you’re
around.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: Can we get together while I’m in
town? I so badly want to sit for you again.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Sit?</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: I’ve changed my hair, you see.
Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: Oh dear. Have I made a
blunder?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Ma’am, the pleasure is all mine. James
Whale.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: I am such a goose. I mistook you
for Cecil Beaton. It’s the hat. You’re wearing one of Cecil’s hats, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hello, George. James Whale. David Lewis’s
friend. I once made pictures myself, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>george cukor</strong>: Yes. Of course. One can’t throw a rock
in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Ma’am, may I present Mr. Clayton Boone?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My gardener, who insisted I bring him today.
He so wanted to meet royalty.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>princess margaret</strong>: Quite. I adore gardens.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: He’s never met a princess. Only queens.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: George, Ma’am, this has been an honor. An
occasion to remember for the rest of my days.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Nothing of importance. Just two old men
slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: David. The friend I thought was in New
York.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. The girl.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Is that really her?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: David produced her last picture.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Just what I was about to ask you. I thought
you were in New York.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I was, until last night. Publicity asked me
to fly Miss Taylor in for today’s reception.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: David Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Clay Boone.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Our yardman. Who was kind enough to serve as
my escort to George’s little do.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Should you be drinking in your condition?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, David, stop being a nanny.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I think I’ll go look at Elizabeth Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You should have seen Georgie’s face when he
met Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You didn’t, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll.
We’re all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You only embarrass yourself.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh dear. I’ll never work in this town
again?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You know what I mean. Your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But I have no reputation. I’m as free as the
air.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well the rest of us aren’t. Can’t you
remember that?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. I never could. You must regret having had
the invitation sent.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I didn’t ask George to invite you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Then who did?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak
to. You’ll be fine on your own?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Yes. Perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: All right, then. I’ll come by tomorrow for
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Mr. Whale!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Mr….Kay?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Bet you thought you’d never see me again. I
didn’t know if you’d be well enough to come to this party.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’m the one who got you on Mr. Cukor’s guest
list.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George
Cukor?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I interviewed him after I met you. I’m his
social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I commend you. If you’re going to pursue
poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody’s
time when you court dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t think that, Mr. Whale. I love your
movies. That’s why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with
your monsters.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My monsters?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Don’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Jimmy. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Elsa?</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: I saw Una O’Conner a few weeks ago.
She said you’d been under the weather.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing
old.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: We’re all getting a bit long in the
tooth.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But you appear quite fresh, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Please. You shouldn’t stand on my
account.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Perfectly all right. But if you’d like to sit
–</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: I’m fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a
few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: What’s our pesky friend up to
now?</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Is that Boris? Our little chum
appears to be arranging a reunion.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Boris, darling. I didn’t know you
were here. These public revels are hardly up your alley.</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: I came for the sake of my visiting
niece. Alice. And Miranda, my great-niece.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: And what do you make of our royal
visitant?</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: Perfectly charming. A real lady.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Of course she’s a lady. What did
you expect? A hussy in tennis shoes?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hey, you! With the camera! We got a historical
moment here. Come get a picture of it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This is Mr. James Whale, who made
“Frankenstein” and “Bride of Frankenstein.” and this is the Monster and
his Bride.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Oh, Karloff. Right.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Don’t you just love being
famous?</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: Are you all right, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Let me get one with Frankenstein
holding the kid.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>boris karloff</strong>: So good to see you again, James.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale. I’ll make
sure everybody gets sent a print.</p>
<p><strong>elsa lanchester</strong>: We’ll be in touch, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Good-bye. So nice to see you…</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Tired. A bit tired.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Are you enjoying yourself?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Actually, no. I feel a little out of
place.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Neither of us really belongs here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Must have been funny for you. Seeing your
monsters again.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Monsters? The only monsters… …are here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to
run for it?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Run for what?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Can’t you see? It’s raining!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Let’s get out of this funk hole</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t want to wait it out? Rain should let
up soon.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: We’re not sugar. We won’t melt.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I better get you home before you catch your
death from pneumonia.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Catch my death.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You all right, Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Jimmy. Please. Call me Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Hanna! Bring us some towels. We’re drenched
to the bone!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Blast her. If we soil her holy floor, it’s
her own damn fault.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: It’s not like her.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just a night out. Sounds like she can’t say no
to her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Certainly you have better things to do than
babysit an old man?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Good. Let’s get dry.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Where’s those clothes you promised?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: He trusts me, you know.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale? Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Mr. Whale?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your
shower already?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Ten minutes ago. Didn’t you hear me
calling?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I
promised you some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’re much wider than I am. You won’t want
to attempt to get into my pants.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No. Definitely not.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Very good, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Absolutely swims on me, but should take care
of your upper half.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That only leaves the rest.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You don’t have any baggy shorts? Pajama
bottoms?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be
too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a
kilt, you know.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do I have any other choice?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Very sporting of you, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Is that –?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The only memento I ever kept. My original
sketch for the Monster.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: After dinner, if Hanna isn’t back? Can we try
a few more sketches?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I thought you’d given up on my picture.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’d like to try again. If you’re game.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why not? Give us something to do while we
wait.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in
mercy killing?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Never gave it much thought.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Come now. I’m sure you came across such
situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?
Someone for whom death would be a blessing.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I never went.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I never made it to Korea.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: But you said –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: – that I was a Marine. Which is true. You
filled in the rest.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day
he turned seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: The Great War?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: By the time he was ready to ship out, the
fighting was over. He missed out.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: A very lucky thing indeed.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: That’s not the way he saw it. To him, it was
like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered.
Definitely not his family.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down
to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going
to be his second chance. They told him he was too old…fat …nearsighted.
Said he’d be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after
his family.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Is that why you joined the Marines? For your
father’s sake?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I figured he’d think, you know – it was the
next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something
important. Something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I didn’t have the guts for it.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I mean, literally. My body screwed me up.
Burst appendix. They gave me a medical discharge. All I thought about
was, how am I going to tell the old man.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You know what he did when I called him? He
laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it
was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Them’s the breaks, right? No war stories for
this pup.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That’s where you’re wrong, Clayton. You’ve
just told one. A very good story indeed.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Storm’s getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: “A perfect night for mystery and horror. The
air itself is filled with monsters.”</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: That’s from your movie, right? “The only
monsters are here.”</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I don’t remember that one.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: James Whale. This afternoon at the party.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I said it must be weird seeing your monsters
again, and you said, “The only monsters are here.” I was wondering which
here you meant.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I don’t recall. Memories of the war,
perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: But that was so long ago. It can’t still
bother you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the
journey I’m about to make.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re planning a trip?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Barnett. Barnett on the wire.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Your friend?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: He caught his one night coming back from the
reconnoiter. I wouldn’t take him out, but McGill did. Just to give the
lad a taste. They were nearly home when a Maxim gun opened fire.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Barnett’s body fell in wire as thick as
briers. It was hanging there the next morning, a hundred yards from the
line, too far out for anyone to fetch it.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: We saw him at morning stand-to and evening
stand-to. “Good morning, Barnett,” we’d say each day. “How’s ole Barnett
looking this morning?” “Seems a little peaky. Looks a little plumper.”
His wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one
could imagine he was napping on bedsprings. He hung there until we were
relieved. We introduced him to the new unit before we marched out,
speaking highly of his companionship.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, but we were a witty lot. Laughing at our
dead. Telling ourselves it was our death too. But with each man who
died, I thought, “Better you than me, poor sod.” A whole generation was
wiped out by that war. Millions and millions of young men.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave
where thy victory?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You survived it. It can’t hurt you now. It’s
no good to dig it up.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh no, my friend. It’s digging itself up.
There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my
diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love.
All gone to me now.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You wanted to draw me like a Greek statue. All
right, then.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: There. Not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: So it is going to happen after all.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No. It won’t do.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What won’t do?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You are much too human.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What did you expect? Bronze?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I would like you to wear this?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: For the artistic effect. The combination of
your human body and that inhuman mask. It’s quite striking.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long
enough for me to see the effect.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s from the first World War, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: There are straps in back.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right. Let’s take it off now.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s too tight.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: We don’t want to tear the straps.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh yes. I am still here.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What steely muscles, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Just take off the fucking mask!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Relax, Clayton. I can’t hear you. I can’t
hear a word.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What a solid brute you are.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No? Maybe this, then?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh yes. I have you now.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Get the fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What will you do to get yourself back?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I’m not that way. Get it through your fucking
head. I don’t want to mess with you.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: That didn’t even sting. You’re not such a
real man after all. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked
in my arms. Won’t they be surprised?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I haven’t done a damn thing with you!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I
kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What the hell do you want from me?!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I want you to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh
so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.
Please, Clayton. We’ve come this far.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Exactly, I’m losing my mind. Every day,
another piece goes. Soon there will be nothing left. Look at the sketch
I made of you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Look, if you want to die do it yourself!</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: No, I don’t want to die alone. But to be
killed by you – that would make death bearable. They say you never see
the one with your name on it. But I want to see death coming at me. I
want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. Your face. Think,
Clayton. You’d be my second Monster. Almost as famous as the first. It
would be the great adventure you’ve yearned for. A war story for both of
us to share.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’d be fully exonerated, I’ve taken care of
that. I wrote a note, I’ll even leave you the house, the car…</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Do it now, Clayton. Make me invisible.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I am not your monster.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What have I done? Oh, selfish, selfish fool.
I have lost my mind.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: What was I thinking?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: You’re a softhearted bloke. A bloody
pussycat.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: My deepest apologies. Can you ever forgive
me?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I suppose not. Good God, I am tired. I really
must go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Oh Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Did I hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Nothing I didn’t deserve.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Pray you, undo this button.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I can never manage it when I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Do you believe people come into our lives for
a reason?</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: I can undress myself, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: When you die…be sure your brain is the last
organ to fizzle –</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: You’ll feel better tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>whale</strong>: Goodnight, Clayton.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Hello? Oh, Mr. David!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: No, no, he did not tell me. But no problem. I
will make breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Ten? Very good, then. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is
that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: There is nothing you can say that will
surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have
time for a cup of coffee before I go?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: I blame my daughter for keeping me out so
late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new
stroke.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Thanks. Why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh
and blood.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: It is my job. I did it when he was happy and
it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk. I
must wake up the master.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Mr. Jimmy? Morning, Mr. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: What have you done with him?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I put him to bed. He’s not there?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Mr. Jimmy! Mr. Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Look for him!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Almost there. Almost there.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Son of a bitch. You crazy son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I didn’t do it. This wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Oh, Mr. Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: He wanted me to kill him, but I didn’t. He did
it himself.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: He says here good-bye. I find it in his room.
He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You poor, foolish man. You couldn’t wait for
God to take you in his time?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You must leave. You were not here this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: But I didn’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: The police will not know that. They will want
to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: We have his note.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Do you want to be questioned about you and
Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body
alone.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: But how’re you going to explain this? How did
you get him out of the pool?</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: You are right. Yes. We must put him back.</p>
<p><strong>hanna</strong>: Poor Mr. Jimmy. We do not mean disrespect.
You will keep better in water.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Who is it? You’re welcome, my friend,
whoever you are.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.
You must please excuse me. But I am blind.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Come in, my poor friend. No one will hurt
you here. If you’re in trouble, perhaps I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Can you not speak? It’s strange. Perhaps
you’re afflicted too. I cannot see and you cannot speak.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: It’s been a long time since any human
being came into this hut. I shall look after you. And you will comfort
me.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: We are friends, you and I. Friends.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Friends.</p>
<p><strong>blind man</strong>: Before you came, I was all alone. It is
bad to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Alone, bad. Friend, good.</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: Friend, good.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Time for bed, sport.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: What’d you think of the movie?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Pretty cool. Better than most monster
movies.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: I knew the guy who made it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Come on, Dad. Is this another one of your
stories?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: It’s his original sketch of the Monster.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is for real?</p>
<p><strong>dana</strong>: The trash, Clay. Before it rains.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Off to bed.</p>
