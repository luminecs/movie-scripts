<h1 id="asylum">asylum</h1>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: Why are there still such headlines?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: This press we cannot control. Americans, I
think.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: You know everyone can be controlled Pavel.
Where are you storing the personnel files?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: In a building belonging to the University in
the Old Town.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: You are quite sure it’s secure?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: The files are in a sealed room and the
University are under strict orders to stay away.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: The storage facility will be ready within a
week, I’ll call you then.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: ……. and yes she wore your bathing suit,
clad and clinging round her sex and yes I thought of you, when you were
still a bubble of breath and hope and love,</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: for those that died and never lied; to
your face or heaving breasts I dream of nightly between damp sheets, as
I run from you and think of Joleen.</p>
<p><strong>on lawrence</strong>: LAWRENCE Okay….The next one I’d like to
share with you is called, “Revisited.”</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Old Town Square a maze of cafes Change
shops offer souvenirs Moving-walks span Charles Bridge Charging a dollar
a ride Fairy tale castle on the hill Licensed to Disneyland And occupied
by a dreamer Directing from an ivory tower Built from sweat, tears and
fear LAWRENCE As part of his inheritance Not content with money and
mortar Pen, paper and wife To carry on and tell the tale He must aspire
to greater things</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Lawrence is getting derogatory again.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Shhhhh, I’m concentrating!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I think he’s jealous of Havel.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He_s the closest we’ve got to an
intellectual.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What’s that? A Democrat with an attitude!</p>
<p><strong>on lawrence</strong>: LAWRENCE And from the dungeon climb To
take a place still warm Exchanging iron clasps for gold Rags for riches
Stories yet to scribe for him</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Great piece Lawrence. Okay next up is…
Holly.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’d like to read some prose, it doesn’t have
a title yet.</p>
<p><strong>angle doug/chris/katka</strong>: DOUG Here comes her life
story all twenty something years of it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let’s hope it don’t take that long to
read.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: As the dawn brings the sun and life to her
body made limp by sleep and the pleasures of his passion she awakes, and
feels her nakedness against the world and his body lying still, next to
her. Stained bed sheet and a pillow, heavy from sweat, are all that
remains to validate his valour in night time combat. But she was not his
foe, that unseen enemy he forced his might against last night; she was
but a cushion for his blows.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No act of love but willing violence demanded
by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to
ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal
creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a
rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body
and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin
body.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well she sure isn’t normal.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Fresh from the shrink I’d say!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, group bloody therapy time.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: So why don’t you get up and speak something,
then we will see who is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ooh, well excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>on holly</strong>: HOLLY And now as the window lace filters
out a darkened past she reaches for her body once more. Her hand glides
from breast to thigh as thoughts of times flow by. Her nipples awake and
race after a conscious thought of lustful moments in grassy fields in
time to see reality reap the earth and leave it barren.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: She has no reason for discontent and less for
hope of what love could be in a privileged world. Her eyes wander once
more and her hand follows, down his spine. The nails that hide no blood
run down the valley of his buttocks, stroking electric hairs that lead
to his well of life and reason. As the tendons in her fingers tighten
her Adonis wakes and her eyes turn to the sky and a life through netted
curtains.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: When the hell did you write that?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Just yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Shit Honey, you could’ve told me. People might
think it’s about us!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Maybe it is!</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Okay let’s take a break there…</p>
<p><strong>ann</strong>: I’m looking for an apartment, my name’s Ann and
I’d appreciate any leads, thanks!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Can I just say….We’re looking for nude males
for our live art drawing classes on Wednesday afternoon, if anyone’s
interested talk to us - there’s no money but plenty of vegie food and
wine.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>angle josh</strong>: JOSH Yeah!…………………… I’d just like to
repeat last weeks note about the upcoming deadline for entries in
“Reflections”, the American Centre’s yearly expose of Western culture
here. If any of you think you’re good enough and would like to see some
of your stuff in print, just see me, Josh.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: That it? Okay, let’s take fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>on doug/katka/chris.</strong>: DOUG There you go Chris, do a
bit of modelling on the side.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No way, you wouldn’t catch me with a rose
between my teeth and my pants in the next room.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he
think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Son of the American ambassador and a banker -
good enough?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Wanker more like, what does he know about
writing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: How to make a buck!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah right!….I don’t know, something isn’t
right with this place, it’s all too sterile and staged. Do you ever
wonder why there’s no Czechs here?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Because it’s in English?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, but it’s not just that. To the Czech
mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground.
If it isn’t, then it’s not radical and not worthy of a look-in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But we are underground?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No you don’t get it. Every cabby in town knows
this joint. So where’s the mystery, the danger?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Why don’t you read something after the break?
DOUG What here? Weren’t you listening to what I just said?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: You used to read.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well not any more, now I’m a serious writer
and above this crap.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, very serious and very part-time.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Inspirations a fickle thing, you don’t realise
you had it till it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And not even then sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: That’s true Doug, writers are supposed to
write.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And pay for their drinks occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You guys having a go a me or what?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We’re only joking…..It is your round
though!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, this place is too expensive so you’ve
had it.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Doug, that’s not nice. You had some money
earlier?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Well, get me and Chris a drink then.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll get the drinks, but not here. Let’s
split. I can’t stand this any more, it’s murdering my respect for
literature.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: But I don’t want to go, I am enjoying it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How about you Brutus?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sorry Katka, but I’m with Doug on this.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go
with the majority, that’s democracy.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: All I’m saying Honey is run the thing past me
for Christ’s sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh that’s it? Everything I do is crap!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So what’s it going to be, Coogan’s or U
Vayvudoo?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I don’t care. I’m not staying out late
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What about that squat bar you showed me, is
that open on a Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, let’s check out the low-life.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I think I’ll go home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come on Kat we’ll just have a couple of
drinks. I can’t just leave Chris on his own!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I’m not staying out late and I can’t come
back to your place.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Whatever!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Anything in it?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, just crap. I want some picture frames.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Never heard of K-MART?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I don’t have the money for those Bourgeois
traps. Hell, I’m making what a Czech earns.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois
joints!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It all comes down to ideology and they’ve lost
theirs. If I’d been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn’t be in the
mess they are today.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s that? Free!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just because they’ve got a choice of four
McDonalds, doesn’t mean they can afford a cheeseburger.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Give’em a break Doug, all it takes is a
little work.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Maybe you should try working more and show us
Czechs how it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: A word of advice my celibate friend. These
Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don’t be fooled;
there’s a price to be paid and it’s going up fast. Right Kat?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re everything a guy could want.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I love it! Freedom of expression suppressed by
mental paralysis.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are you having?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: A coke, if they have it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Hey Doug, you want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, what else?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Cheers Katka!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Naz dravi!…..What do you like about this
place, these people, Chris?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know. It’s kind of underground.
Doug’s right, there’s too much crap in this town.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I used to think he was right about a lot of
things but now I don’t know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I
think I am wasting my time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, you guys are great together. He’ll come
through, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who’s your friend?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in
Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ……Come
on, let’s grab a table.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What did the beer cost?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Fifteen crowns.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: This place is getting expensive too, used to
be twelve.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Still, fifty cents ain’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know this place could be the answer to
what we’ve been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh yeah, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: An alternative literary venue!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I ain’t sure poetry will go down too well
here.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, it’s the whole idea behind it. How did
they get this place?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Squatted it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his
mates took the whole freakin’ building.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So? DOUG Well, there’s tons of empty
buildings - why don’t we get one?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We? Doug they’re Czech you’re not. You can’t
go taking people’s property.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What we need is a space for real performance
art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’ve got to stop using that word “we” it’s
getting kind of scary. Right Katka?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: It’s just talk, he’s drunk.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No I’m not, I came to Prague looking for
something - this could be it!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He’s not drunk, he’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe, but someone’s got to make a stand.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Like Custer huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: These guys think the West is just MTV and
Hollywood movies. We’ve got to show them there’s more to it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There’s “we” again. Do you think he means
us?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ve got to talk to Lubosh and get a handle on
this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So how’s your work?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: It’s okay, they’re training me on the cash
register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sounds cool…..Do you think he’s serious about
squatting a place?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t care. I see too much of
him and he’s changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he’s
been doing nothing for months, like he doesn’t care about anything,
including me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, he sure seems fired up all of a
sudden.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: It won’t last, believe me. And you, when will
you go back to the States?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know, maybe I’ll enrol for postgrad’
studies next Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>on katka/chris</strong>: KATKA Did you ever see Marketa
again?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, she’s a great girl but I couldn’t keep up
with her. Thanks for trying but I think I’ll stay single for now.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice
girl.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Like you?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: No, better than me. You know, I have many
friends, you should meet more of them.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Jahn, this is my girlfriend Katka and an
American friend, Chris Freeman.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good news comrades, it’s better than we’d
hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it’s
a piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Care to elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, providing we’re treated like Czechs and
we squat something that’s not privately owned, we should be in the
clear; at least DOUG until they get an eviction order and bring in the
bailiffs.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Amazing, he didn’t even say “if”.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No “if’s” or “but’s” it’s a cinch. Do you want
to know what the icing is?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: No Doug, we don’t and I have to be going.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t give me this Kat, I’m doing it for you
and your country.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: What? You are crazy!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, just hear me out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Okay, we’re listening. But I’m with Katka on
this one.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, it’s like I said, there’s a ton of empty
buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the
city, so they’re not private…. Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the
University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a
puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of
money.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Puppet theatre, don’t you need something a
little bigger?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s big, right Jahn?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Yeah, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And, since it’s only two streets away, I
suggest we go take a look. Now!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Doug I can’t, I’ve got to be at work by
eight. You promised to take me home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look Kat it’ll only take ten minutes. Without
Jahn I might never find it… We’ll just have a quick look and then you
and I’ll hit a tram.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I don’t want to get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t worry it’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>on doug/jahn</strong>: JAHN The place will need lots of work,
I think you might need some help.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You mean you’d like to help?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just
warning you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ve got lots of friends.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: You can get in through windows at the back,
through here. The main entrance is round the corner on Betlemska street,
but it’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, it’s in here somewhere. Let’s keep it
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We could make a run for it?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I’m not going in Doug. I’ll wait for you
here.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through
here?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Sure, I’ve done it easily.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s a lot of bloody rubble lying
around…….Jesus, it’s dark!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Have you got your Mag-Lite, Chris?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Wow………I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You were right Jahn, it’s a great space…..
Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No thanks, I think we ought to get going
though.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner
in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a
good clean out and the power on, then we’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know man, I’ll drink beer and shoot
crap with you anytime, but this is different.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Damn right it is, it’s a chance to do
something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell,
you’ll probably be gone in another six months and all you’ll have done
is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep’ song - c’mon, don’t run out
on me now!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Alright I give in. But let’s not end up in
jail. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You got my word on it.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Doug you said you wouldn’t be long. Come on,
I’ve got to go. Now!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright, I’m coming. It’s the perfect place
Jahn, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris are you teaching tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, I got nothing till Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great. Let’s say nine o’clock here tomorrow.
Catch you later partner.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: It’s not fair, you hardly talked to me
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m sorry but it’s been a crazy evening. I’m
going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Oh Doug, stop it, I have to get home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let’s walk over the bridge, we haven’t done
that for a while.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: We should go to the Metro it’s quicker.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other
side, it won’t take any longer. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Kat, I’m in paradise. I don’t ever want to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: So, we won’t be going to London?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, not just yet.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I hope you’re going to invite me in?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Everybody is at home, it’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let’s have a look anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mum</strong>: Ciao Baby, Hello Douglas!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Ahoj</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hi Mrs M.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Ciao</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I’m not moving.</p>
<p><strong>on katka/doug</strong>: KATKA See!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Max looked like he needed a walk, why don’t
you take him?</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: He doesn’t, he’s been!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: A hundred crowns says he’d like to go
again.</p>
<p><strong>helena</strong>: I am not going!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: She’s tired.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s bad news when you can’t even bribe
kids.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I want you so bad. She’ll be asleep soon,
maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: No way Doug, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, you’re right…. I’ve got an idea!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Dougy?</p>
<p><strong>on doug</strong>: DOUG Have you been waiting long?</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: CHRIS Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sorry, I couldn’t resist going exploring.</p>
<p><strong>on chris</strong>: CHRIS Some puppet theatre. Jesus, look at
all this crap.</p>
<p><strong>angle doug</strong>: DOUG Watch out.</p>
<p><strong>on chris</strong>: CHRIS I don’t know man, this place is just
a hole in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: DOUG No, there’s something special
about this place. It’s as though it’s living, disintegrating - You could
almost chart the history of the country by this wall alone.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Suppose the roof’s like that too.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, that’s what’s been holding it together all
these years, just like mother Russia.</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: CHRIS Sure. What are we going to do
with this place Doug? It’s due for demolition, that’s why they gave up
on it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Believe me, Chris. I’ve got a good feeling
about this place, come on.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s our first job.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That stinks!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, that could be job number two. I think
it’s a sewer.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Cool, real cool!</p>
<p><strong>on chris</strong>: CHRIS Hey look, an old pay-phone. I wonder
if it’s got any money in it?</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: DOUG Never mind now - First, I’ll
find the switchboard and see if I can get the power on.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You know something about those things?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, but like my dad said, “There’s only so
many ways you can wire a plug”.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He was an electrician?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, he was talking about girls, I think.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That makes you an expert I guess.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Too right….Now the other thing we’ve got to do
is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess
I might as well come out lookin’ like one!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll give you a hand as soon as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Just two things. What do I use to shift the
stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Scout around and see if there’s something,
check that other corridor. If there’s nothing, nip out and buy a broom
and shovel.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And put it on expenses?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure….As for the crap, I’ve got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Somehow, I’m going to have to band-aid that
thing since we can’t really replace it and then put a walkway over
it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, we might as well start filling it in
now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I
can get to it, we’re set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling
into the space - We’ll neaten it up later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You sure got a handle on that word “we”.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, what do you know!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not bad hey, I think I’ll add Sparkie to my
resume…..Good shovel!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, you’re in luck there’s two of them, the
other’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Later Mate, right now I’ve got to do the locks
on these doors so we don’t have to climb through that bloody window
every time.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought that was part of the charm!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll drill the locks and replace the barrels,
that way it won’t cost so much.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A locksmith too? Why d’you ever bother with
writing?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m making history Chris, nothings going to
stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President
Havel hears.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll settle for a pardon. You gotta
drill?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No…..But I think Honza at the office has. You
keep shifting this crap and I’ll take care of the locks, shouldn’t take
long. Take a break for lunch and I’ll catch you up later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And if the police stop by - what do I tell
them?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tell them we’re working for the
University.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Thought of everything haven’t you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yep, except a name for this place.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re nuts man, Katka’s right!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hi Rene, any messages?</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Hey Doug, where you been?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Working….Under cover.</p>
<p><strong>on honza</strong>: HONZA Yeah, what’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: There’s nothing for you Doug. Are you going
to be around today?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, I’m too busy. Is the boss in?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Yes and I think he would like to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright Jiri, getting the hang of it?</p>
<p>**on doug*: DOUG I need to borrow something from you Honza.</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Forget it, I’m broke.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, just a drill.</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: A drill, what are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nothing. I’ve got to put up some kitchen
shelves that’s all. You’ve got one haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And a fifty foot extension lead?</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: You don’t have fifty foot of apartment!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come on, don’t me give a hard time. I’m just
trying to make the place look nice for Katka.</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask
you for something?</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It
belongs to my father.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No problem, is it at your place?</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great, let’s break for lunch and I’ll buy you
a beer on the way.</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: But I have to finish this….</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come on, that shit can wait.</p>
<p><strong>angle henry</strong>: HENRY Well, Well, Douglas it’s good to
see you. Have you stopped by to pick up your things?</p>
<p><strong>on doug/honza</strong>: DOUG No, I came to have a word with
you. I’ve got something I think you’ll like.</p>
<p><strong>angle henry</strong>: HENRY Really, what’s that? A terminal
illness!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, it’s a story on the cutting edge of
Prague’s sub-culture. If you’ve got a moment, I’ll fill you in.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hang five Honza, I’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>on henry</strong>: HENRY So? What’ve you got for me?</p>
<p><strong>on doug/henry</strong>: DOUG The inside scoop on the squat
scene!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What squat scene?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You mean you don’t know, Henry! We got a bunch
of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down
on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don’t know about
it?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Ah, so what?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s only the half of it. I’ve heard a
rumour they’re taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you
know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Henry, these guys already push most of the
drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right?
Believe me, it won’t stop there either, next it’ll be a church and
pretty soon they’ll have their own department store or something……
Henry, we’ve got to stop them. The foundation’s got to put an end to
it!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m in close with these guys, it isn’t easy,
but slowly they’re opening up to me. Give me a month and I’ll blow their
movement wide open.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A month, Jesus! And how do I know you’re not
crapping me?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You can hold back this months pay-check until
I come through with the story.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What pay-check? You ain’t done nothing!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Henry, I’ve been working my tail off on this.
Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you’ve
got the scoop. It’ll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big
feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back
home!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I got a bad feeling about this…. How much do
you need?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand
crowns?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There’s three thousand and if you don’t come
through, I’m going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Deal!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And take Jiri with you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Insurance!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey Jiri, it’s your lucky day you’re working
with me. Here’s what I want you to do - Go to this address, you’ll find
a cafe; a squat. I want you to keep an eye on it and put everything down
in a daily report to Rene. This is big, so don’t let me down, okay? Just
dress up smart and take lots of notes..</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Come on Honza let’s split, drinks on me.</p>
<p><strong>honza</strong>: So, he didn’t fire you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No way, he even gave me back pay.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Wow!….What have you been doing, rolling around
in it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, just making my contribution to cultural
enlightenment, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, don’t get carried away.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ll try not to, I’ll leave that to you.
Anyway, there’s still plenty more of it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good, I love swinging a shovel.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Wasn’t easy, but I’ve got what we need.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Where did you find it all, in a pub?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: ’cause you stink of booze.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, that was Honza’s idea, I had to buy him
a few beers in return for the gear.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Looking good, another day and we should have
this place cleared up.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You belong in museum…. Guess what?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Nope, not even close. I’ve thought of a name
for this place and you were the inspiration though.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Really, “The Freeman Centre”?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No….The Asylum!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh yeah, what’s my connection to that?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: None, it’s mine - you said it earlier, I’m
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’ve been saying that since we met.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to
be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we
can use that in the marketing.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Asylum….Marketing….Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Here, try it for size.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Perfect, but I can’t use it right now, I’ve
got to get these locks done; it’s a matter of priorities.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, I’m beginning to see that.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just save me a little patch and I’ll do it
later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: The door didn’t take long!</p>
<p><strong>angle chris</strong>: CHRIS Lost something?</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: DOUG That’s strange, it’s as if
there’s another section in here and it’s not connected to the
apartments.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You mean we’ve been short-changed?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I don’t know but that used to be a window and
I think that was a door.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Can you do the lock on it?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, it’s welded up!….Let’s take a look from
the inside.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It must be on the other side of this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: But how did the wall get here?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I don’t know. This wall isn’t like the rest
though, it’s not all that old either.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: This wall looks like it’s been put up to block
it off. It’s not part of the building support.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’d love to get in there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t we have enough already?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It must be fair old size, suppose it’s
empty?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And suppose a little old lady lives
there?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No way, it’s sealed - if she’s in there she’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sounds like a good reason to leave it
alone.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just think though, it would make a hell of a
cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, it’s definitely there - We’ve just got
to get to it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a
cafe?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll rig up something don’t worry - Do you
think I could bash through with that little hammer?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t know Doug, we haven’t even got the
place together and already you want to extend it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t worry if the old lady’s there I’ll brick
it back up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look I gotta get going, shouldn’t you have
met Katka?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Is it gone four-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Uh-Oh.</p>
<p><strong>on doug</strong>: DOUG Here’s one of the keys, lock up!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m sorry!…….I lost track of time, I’ve been
working on that building all day.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Beer please! Do you want another drink?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Fernet and tonic.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So, how was your day?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I think I’m stupid…..All you do is use me and
expect me to wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I thought you loved me Doug but all you want
from me is sex.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s not true, we have a great time
together. I’ve said I’m sorry. Let’s forget about it and go stop by my
place, so I can get changed.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Oh sure and you will want sex, always
sex.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I could have my choice of many boyfriends and
go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then
going to stupid pubs.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I
can’t do that shit.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: That’s it, I am just stupid teenager,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right now, yeah - you’re talking crap.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I wanted someone who loves me, all my friends
talk of getting married and what will happen to me? You just use me!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, I love you, really.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, I love you Katka but I’m twelve years
older, I could never marry you, it’d be stupid, you know that!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: See! You think I’m stupid, You just use me
and you will never love me…. I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bill please.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: :INT - ASYLUM FOYER - CHRIS - DAY</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Couldn’t wait huh? Well, you sure done it
now.</p>
<p><strong>on doug</strong>: DOUG Welcome to the “Hole in the wall
Cafe.”</p>
<p><strong>on doug/chris</strong>: CHRIS What’s in the those?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just crap I think, we can whiz it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Need any disks?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, I’ll take some.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I’m on my way to class, I’ll stop by
later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, her name’s Kavlova, why?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: See if she can donate some paintings or
something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’d be better off with tables and
chairs.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, you could try her, but I was thinking of
stopping by a second-hand place for those.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Doug, haven’t seen you for a while.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ve been around.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Have you met Holly? Josh’s friend.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No! Look Lawrence, I’ve taken over the lease
on a theatre downtown and I’m throwing a party tomorrow night to show it
off. It’s going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to
finish it off, can you put the word out?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Sure. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here’s the details.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll put one on the notice-board too.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Am I invited?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure as long as you don’t bring that prick
Josh. Thanks Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Nice guy, what’s he got against Josh?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: He just despises success and society
generally, it’s not personal.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Is he an actor?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What’s he doing with a theatre then?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Probably won it in a poker game!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Moved on to plumbing huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We got a party tomorrow night. Can’t have the
place smelling like shit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Guess what? We got last semester’s art
collection.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great….Ask them to put them in the cafe, we’ll
hang them later.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s really coming together!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks kids they’re great, stop by for a beer
anytime!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought you were gonna throw these?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I had a better idea, we’ll burn them. There’s
a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Destroy the evidence huh.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Have you ever stolen anything?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Could you handle it if it was in a good
cause?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Like helping a sick kid?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, for the Asylum.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Close!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s that, five instead of ten years
jail.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They’ll never get us.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Last one!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, lets get some gear now.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Perfect!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It looks new, they might miss one or two.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’re going to need it all.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jesus Doug, they’ll execute us!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Stealing’s stealing, we might as well get what
we need. This’ll do for the floor and the walkway too.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Let’s split.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not yet, we need a few lengths of
scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why don’t we just take the whole damn
building, brick by brick Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look at it this way, it’s their contribution.
If we’d explained it to them, they’d probably have given it to us
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So why didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We don’t speak Czech!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Lubosh, Lubosh.</p>
<p><strong>lubosh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Lubosh, it’s me Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: My squat is looking great and it should be up
and running by the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>lubosh</strong>: Good for you!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, well do you think you and the guy’s
could stop by on Saturday and play some tunes. All the beer you can
drink!</p>
<p><strong>lubosh</strong>: Okay, but remind me Saturday, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ugh, okay…Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh Lubosh…If you see a young man spying on
this joint, his name’s Jiri and he’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Am I late?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, not if you’ve got better things to do.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Who put a bee up your butt?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Like a hand?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: When your ready Son!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You want those fittings as well?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah and can you bring the drill up too.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You should qualify for some kind of
award…..I’ve got it, the Nobel prize for Unauthorized
Reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay Bonzo, we’ve got to join these pieces
together then stick those stands on the ends and fix’em to the
pillars.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A safety rail, Ingenious!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You measure up the other sides and cut the
rest of the scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Tape?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey….That look high enough to you?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yes Boss!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Want one?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No. Here give me a hand with this
scaffold.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Just hold it up there.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here, give me one of those smokes.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you think anyone will really come
here?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, I think I_ve got a handle on the Czech
pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the
sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for Kafka.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Fancy some lunch after we_re through with
this Meccano shit?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’d better get some booze in for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You should have said it was
Bring-A-Bottle.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, I figure once they see the place and we
get’em a little drunk, they’ll all want to help. We should have that
floor done in a day or so.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here, let’s both put in two hundred crowns.
That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No beer?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not on the opening night, wouldn’t look
right.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You get the wine and I’ll go see if I can
rustle up some plastic cups.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Why don’t we go together?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, it could take me hours. You know what it’s
like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff
- I wouldn’t think they’ve ever heard of them.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Red or white?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Both, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>on doug/lawrence/chris</strong>: LAWRENCE Interesting space
you got here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No expense spared.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’d like to talk with you about doing some
performance poetry here….A weekly thing.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot
to do.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We should be done by the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I could pencil you in if you like?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I’ll take a rain-check for now.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Can I have your attention, please.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thank you, thank you………..Okay, I’d like to
welcome you to the Asylum’s pre-opening party. I hope you’re all DOUG
having a good time…..The Asylum_s a free-space for performing art and we
hope to share the more radical elements of our culture with the Czech_s
and vice-versa. Anyway, we want this place to be your place and together
I believe we can really make a difference…You may however have noticed
that there is still little work to do, like the flooring downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>heckler</strong>: What about a john?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, that too eventually. For those of you
that don’t know, the nearest toilet is in the pub around the corner.
Anyhow, part of the reason for inviting you this evening was to ask you
to help out over the next few days to get the floor done and maybe some
painting too. You don’t have to be an expert, we’ve proved that…..So, if
I could have a show of hands?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I said, hands up all those willing to help out
a little here.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let me see if I understand this. You lot,
think you represent Western culture here and when you’re given an
opportunity of a life-time to prove it, you turn it down. Don’t you want
to get your hands dirty or something, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I see, you’ve got your hands too far up your
collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody
wine.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Forget it Doug, it’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Go on, get out, everybody out, out.
Out!…..Out!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: All in all, I think it went pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Beats my performance shit.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Carpentry can’t be that tough, we’ll do
it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Have you cleared all the rubble up?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re all bloody useless.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Hi, want to take up dancing?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Later. Jahn, I’ve been let down by the guys
who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took
my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Yes, The Obelisk but it’s closed for
repairs.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So I hear, do you know some of the stage
hands?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Sure, they are students.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, I want them to put down a floor and a
walkway.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: What about money?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s three thousand crowns, it’s all I
got.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: It’s not so much.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, if you can get them to finish it by
Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that
night.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Can we charge admission?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Donations only! And make the thing
non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: I’ll do my best. Is the place open.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yep, it’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I thought I’d help out.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We don’t need you.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That’s not what you said last night. And, I
didn’t bring that “prick” Josh.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of
the crap.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Nice job.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Time for lunch I think. I’ll get the
sandwiches. What would you like Holly?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m not hungry, really.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Get me a couple of beers and a salami.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We could make a start on the floor
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, We aren’t going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Seems a shame!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The way I look at it, I’ve carried the camel
to water and stuffed it’s head under - if it doesn’t drink now, we might
as well shoot the thing and call it a day.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Now, you’re making sense.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Friends, Czechs, Socialists, lend me your
ears! I come in peace and bring pyramid-selling. You have been freed
from under that cloak of evil and corruption Hear me out I beg of you.
They build another McDonalds not one mile from here and plan yet more.
Trust me blindly.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I beseech you, look not West for guidance but
to me, I am your hope, your future. Follow me and you will need no
other. Where there is darkness, I shall put streetlights, where there is
misery, I shall visit and where there is desperation, I will
telephone.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We shall all live as one with me in the castle
and you but a metro ride away. Give me a sign!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Booooooo! Booooooo!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, that’s what we’ve got to work with, we
need a walkway over all this shit. And some kind of floor down below……
Think they can do it?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: They’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great. And your all set for the
performance?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Yeah, it’s a simple piece. If they get the
floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon,
but it’s not critical.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t go making it too simple, we’re on the
cutting edge here.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: For us it’s simple, for you it’s
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get
some beers for the guys.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Don’t worry. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’re going to need more beer, got any money
Chris?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s all I got on me!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I can’t, I’ve got to split. I have to take a
class at two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>shop assistant</strong>: Prosim!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Pivo…..Twenty, ugh Dvacet.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sac, prosim?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Derva!</p>
<p><strong>shop assistant</strong>: Scheck-No?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Ano.</p>
<p><strong>shop assistant</strong>: Sto, dervat-set ossum
pas-de-saht.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Why are you doing all this, what for?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, I’ve failed at everything else I’ve done
and I can’t hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What’s the Bugler?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s a student magazine networked through
Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the
States.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I figured you more as a Socialist?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I moving more to Communism now it’s dying
out.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: A champion of lost causes huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, I’m just running scared, same as everyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We_re not all running away</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I know, some are trapped, usually by
money.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It_s the same, too much or too little,
neither_s comfortable reality-wise.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Yo, dobree!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Shall I wash these out?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, we’d better keep them for now, I’ll try
and get some glasses for tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here, let me get some fresh water.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How goes it?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: It is okay……..We will paint the wood black,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, great….Dobchay! It will dry, yes?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Yes, of course…maybe one hour.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good, great….Dobchay!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, we aren’t rich but I’ll buy you a beer
later.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Deal!</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and
also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s perfect, you’ve done a great job.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great…..Dobchay!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Is it dry?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah seems okay.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You did it Doug, it’s really come
together.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, I’ve made my own nut-house Care to dance
with the Doc’?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I apologise, but it is urgent.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: The files located on down on Betlemska are in
danger.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: You are responsible…What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: We’re not sure…</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: What are you an idiot!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: The building has been occupied and the locks
have been changed.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: The University cannot do this. Is the room
safe?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it
is not the University who are in the building.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: So, who is in the building?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Some Americans?</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: Have you lost all control of this city?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I don’t understand it, there were a lot of
people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: I don’t think you realise what will happen if
those files are made public. The lives of thousands of officers depend
on the secrecy of those records, including your own now.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: It was crazy not to have destroyed them</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: That was not my decision, I can only guess
that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the
meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building
and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: And what of these foreigners?</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: I don’t care about Americans. Arrest them all
if you have to, but keep those records secret.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: If those files have been touched, I cannot
help you!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hell honey, what’ve you been doin’?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I decided to help out at the Asylum.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: See you brought one of the patients with you
too.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Josh!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well come on, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: We’ll take another table, I’d like to talk to
Doug a little more about the Asylum. You ought to see it, it’s looking
great.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah, so I hear. Don’t you think you should go
get changed?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay honey, but don’t be long. I got
plans.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What would you like, beer?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, just a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: One beer, one coffee, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I think we should be going honey.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, for a start, you’ve got to get cleaned
up.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Come on Honey, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I don’t want to go.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It’s time to go home, Holly.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Why don’t you just let her stay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Leave off, she’s not going.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Stay out of this asshole!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m telling you to let her go!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You want to step outside?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Josh, drop it. I’ll come along okay. I’m
really sorry Doug, I’ll see you at the opening tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Opening! He couldn’t open a freaking
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Come on Holly!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Leave me, just leave me alone Josh.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’d better get you to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll be okay, just get me home.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Which way Doug?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s that one over there.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s all my fault, I’m so sorry Doug.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I had it coming from someone.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Are you sure I shouldn’t get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Do you have any antiseptic?….. I’ll get some
water.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Who you saving the dishes for?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Guests.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Don’t you have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Could you switch the stereo on?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Here, let me help.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’d better get going, do you need a hand to
get into bed?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: :EXT - PRAGUE STREET - HOLLY - DAY</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wrong apartment honey, lose your way?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I laid your things out on the floor…. There’s
carrier bags in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: That’s my bag.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It’s more than what you’re worth.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah and you’re a slut, so what?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Shall I look after the rest?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Don’t you dare, I’ll be back!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Afternoon!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: My God! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I fell in love.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And a tram hit you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No, the boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What happened to Katka?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Didn’t I tell you, she dumped me Monday
night.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You Romeo’s sure pay a high price sometimes -
anyone I know?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Holly!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Couldn’t keep your hands off the hired help,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: She’s as American as apple pie too. Have you
figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: She’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: A fine specimen for conversion.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What are you on about?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, I take it you’re going to drag her down
to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Don’t tell me you really are in love?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So
what?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Nothing, it’s just that’s when things usually
start to go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So this is what true-love looks like?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We’ve got to rope off the performance area. Go
string it tight between the pillars.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What a picture!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Did you take your things over to my place?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Run into Josh?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, but it was okay.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How did he look?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Better than you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hmm, I still owe him.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Why don’t we both forget about him?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Everything okay.</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Yes, it’s looks good…..We will use this for
the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights.
The others will just be house lights.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Great….How long will it go for?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: About forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Cool….So, if we say eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Let me know if you need anything.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris, can you do me a favour?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I
promised to get it back for the weekend and I don’t want to show my face
there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You might make Henry happy……Sure, I’ll do
it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good, and then type up a notice on your
computer for tonight’s thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the
faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It’ll start at eight o’clock
and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I’ll go and get some beer

<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: We ain’t going to give it away this time, are

<p><strong>doug</strong>: Shit no, it’ll be twice cost.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You capitalist pig!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The performance is free what more do you
want….I’ve set that old phone up as a donation box and I’ll get Jahn to
write out a sign….Okay, let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Does Jahn’s thing have a name?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey Jahn…..You got a name for this thing?</p>
<p><strong>jahn</strong>: Stvorhene!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put
Debut of….Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That’ll cover us if it flops.
On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Cool!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Right on Bro’ !</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Weren’t you going to get some glasses?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more
money?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I hope people turn up tonight.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks, I’ll be right back, fancy some

<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yeah, I’m starved.</p>
<p><strong>lawwrence</strong>: Dude, you really got something happening
here……You want to talk about a slot now?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m re-thinking the Western side, I’ll give
you a call.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Turned Czech huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay everyone it’s time for the performance.

the box as you go in and the bar will reopen afterwards. The balcony is
open but, like the auditorium, DOUG you must stand; please don’t go
taking these chairs……Take your places now, it starts in five
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You are all under arrest…. Stay where you
are!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What the hell’s going on? …..You can’t do
this!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Silence………Silence!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I want those responsible to step
forward….NOW!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: If those that are responsible do not come
forward, you will all be arrested.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s me you want, I’m responsible for all
this.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: He’s lying! I am.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Shut up Chris, stay out of it. Jahn, tell them
to stay back, do it!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: This is your doing?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes, they had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: And you broke into that room?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: You will wish you hadn’t.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Take him to the station!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Take the details of all these people before
releasing them. Search the building, secure it and then report to
me.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Have someone go to Betlemska and locate that
drum.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Are you quite sure you destroyed all the
files and the disks?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Why did you break into that particular
building?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It was the biggest I could find.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: What was the real purpose behind this
venture?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: A kind of freedom.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Either you’re a liar or you are a fool.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Go on have one, it will be a long night.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: :INT - JAIL INTERVIEW ROOM -
DOUG/DIPLOMAT - DAY</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: I’m just here to record some details,
standard stuff.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You mean your NOT going to spring me?</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: I don’t know what it is with you bloody
hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have
to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when
finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic
wand and get you out, well not this time, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell,
yes?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Date of birth, November the fourth
nineteen-sixty-two.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue,
Coventry.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s my mum’s.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: I see, would you like us to inform her of
your situation?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Now, have you been read your rights and
are you aware of the charges?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Well, I’ll try and get that clarified. As
I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft,
trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of
government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying
people’s medical records?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They didn’t look like medical files to me.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Well a plea of ignorance won’t go far
here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Regards to Her Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Before you go, did you get those bruises
here?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted
Conservative.</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: My name is Jaroslav Novak, I will be your
translator.</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: This is Petr Vitovetch, he will represent
you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: About time I saw a lawyer. We’ve got some
serious talking to do.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Any chance of getting me out on bail?</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: What is bail?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Will they free me?</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: I don’t know - maybe they are talking
about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Will this thing take long?</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: No, it should be over soon.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You mean it’s started?</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: Of course, you can see that lady over
there, she is recording everything.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How do I know what’s being said?</p>
<p><strong>jaroslav</strong>: I will tell you - within a week I will
have the transcript and we can go through it.</p>
<p><strong>petr</strong>: He is in big trouble, the Judge will hang him
out to dry, but tell him he has nothing to worry about. The trial will
be in two weeks and he must stay in police custody till then. Here are
the charges.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep
you waiting.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Josh, I have to speak you, it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Of course Darling, you’d like to
apologise?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Can we talk in your office?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hold all my calls and book me a table for
lunch at Luigi’s.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was
he good in bed?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Josh, I need your help. Doug’s been arrested,
he’s in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might
be able to do something.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You really are a piece of work, you know that?
You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect
us to help him when he screws up.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Suppose I do help him?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Will you come home and forget all about
him?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Yes, if you can get him free.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Alright, I’ll see to it and things’ll be just
as they were, okay?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Deal?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I thought I’d find you here.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Chris! Tell me some good news.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Tell me some bad news?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I don’t want to ruin your day.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That bad?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Your too good for this town, Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: So I hear.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I had a visit from the British Embassy. They
think I’m a stray soccer hooligan.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: They ain’t the only ones.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I stopped by your office. Henry was steaming,
he says he’s going to throw you out of the window and that you never
worked at the Bugler.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: He got that one right.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Honza says they’ll print an open letter to
President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a
walk-out.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They’re good guys….. Have you seen Holly?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his
friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be
expelled.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did you see a lawyer and go before a
judge?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah. I tell you, they’re one big happy family
over there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I don’t know, I’m waiting for the
transcript.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, the trial’s in two weeks, but I think
they’ve already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can
slot me in.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: WE gotta think of something.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Now you’re using that word.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: I could try and get a Western lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You know, there is one thing I can’t figure
out. All along they’ve been bugging me about those files and when I told
them I’d burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul
guy they were medical records?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, it seems they’ve dropped any charge
relating to the files.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Lucky break!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Maybe, but I’ve started to wonder what those
files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on
big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that
might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Did you see anything in the files?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It was all in Czech wasn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: What happened to those disks I gave you, have
you still got them?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Suppose those contained all the file info too?
You could have a third or so of it there.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Do you want me to see what’s on them?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No point, it’ll be in Czech and God knows what
format. But if I’m right, they could be my ticket out of here.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: And if you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Siberia.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to
smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write
the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this
doesn’t work. You’d better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know
someone with a phone?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, Dave Walters.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Good, what’s his number?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s…42 56 76 .</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: 42 56 76……… Okay, you wait at Dave’s for my
call tomorrow, if you don’t hear from me by three o’clock, send that
note and get out of the country fast.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Doug, I can’t just leave you!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You’re in the clear, keep it that way, I’ll be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: If I cut a deal, I’m not staying in this
country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn’t come here
today, you’re going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call,
promise?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure….Anything else I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: You could give me your baseball, so I can
drive this bastard nuts…..He’s been playing chequers for eight hours and
still hasn’t won a game.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks, now get lost. Go on!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Not much in that!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Kat, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Chris came to see me, I did not know this had
happened to you. He asked me to give you something.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I thought for sure they would catch me.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: Will it help to get you out?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I hope so!</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: If you get out can we be together again.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m no good for you Katka, besides I won’t be
able to stay in Prague.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: But we could go to London and live in
England.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I
don’t ever want to live there again.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I don’t understand, it’s your home?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: There’s nothing there for me.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: I’m sorry about what I said, really I am.
Just take me with you, I don’t care where.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Forget about me Kat.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: But I love you!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you,
but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone
else.</p>
<p><strong>katka</strong>: No, it’s not true, you’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not this time, Kat.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Time up, come on, get out.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Bye!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Enjoying our hospitality?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: We’ll have to see what more we can do for
you, while you are still our guest.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Thanks, but I don’t intend to stay.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Really!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I lied to you, I didn’t destroy the floppy
disks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: They’re going to be on their way to Reuters
this afternoon if I’m not released by two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We
have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are
there, just as you said.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Not all of them!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s original and I’ve got seven others. Now,
do we talk or do we let Reuters figure it out?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: You are playing a very dangerous game, I
suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I didn’t get to see what’s on the disks but I
can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Look, I don’t know where the disks are, but if
I don’t walk free within four hours, Reuters will get them.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: First, I want to walk free with a letter, in
English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I
want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three
thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the
students are to be stopped!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I’m not sure it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The choice is yours, it’s not negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: The clock’s running.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: And there has been enquiries from the
American Embassy maybe they are involved?</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: All the more reason to eliminate him.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: What if his accomplices have made copies?</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: It was all on a Russian format, I don’t think
that would be so easy; we must take that chance.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: I’ll have the letter drawn up. You see to the
money and the tickets, then MIRA speak to Dr. Novotny at the University,
mention my name if you must.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: Delay Mr Greenwell’s departure until the disks
have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your
officers drive him home - I’ll see to the rest.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>mira</strong>: Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel,
let there be no more, for your sake.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: You are a very lucky man Mr Greenwell.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: We agree to your terms, here is the
letter.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’m free to go?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: As agreed!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: And the students?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I have the Director’s word, there will be no
action against them. You may go once we have the disks.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: How do I know this isn’t a trap?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: You have the letter and my word, if you wish
you may wait upstairs….Now, where are the disks?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I’ll need to make a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: You may use my office.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Would you like your things now?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Release Mr Greenwell’s possessions.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Hey, where’s my Zippo, my lighter?</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Give him his lighter!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Please sign for your things.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Do you mind turning away for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Yeah, everything’s okay……When they’ve got the
disks……..Give it to me…….</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Right. Have you seen Holly?……Try her at her
old apartment maybe she went to collect the rest of her things. …..Just
tell her we’ve got to get out, I’ll be at my apartment within an hour.
……..I hear Poland’s pretty laid back. ……..Look me up in Krakow……No, WE
did a hell of a job….Thanks, take care.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Central station, locker number 139 -
combination JFK.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Good, wait here, it will not take long and
then you may go.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What’s the idea of hanging up on me?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I can’t go with him.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Look, I don’t care whether you go with Doug
or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You don’t understand, I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab
your coat ’cause you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I made a deal with Josh.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It was a condition of getting Doug out.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: In return for Doug’s freedom, I was never to
see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Josh didn’t get Doug out of jail, he did a
deal in return for some computer disks we’d held onto.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You mean, Josh’s father had nothing to do
with it?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure I’m sure!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Well, he should be on his way back to his
apartment by now.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Do you know the way?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Sure, it’s on the red metro line you….</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No, by road?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah, pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Good we’ll take Josh’s Jeep, come on!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: It’s been nice knowing you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: We had a deal!</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will
drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: That’s okay I like the metro, it’s only a
couple of stops from here.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I insist, it is the least we can do.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: I strongly advise you to be on that plane
this evening.</p>
<p><strong>pavel</strong>: Goodbye Mr Greenwell.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Mind if I smoke?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Well, you’re all morons</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: In fact, I would say that you are the dumbest
brick-head I’ve ever met and that your boss is a real bastard.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I insist cretin, take it. Go on and look that
up while you’re at it.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Take this exit.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: That one?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Take it easy, or Doug’ll be visiting us in
jail - or worse, hospital.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Jesus Holly, we got enough time.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Okay, but I don’t want to miss him.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Follow that Budjovice sign.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s that one isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Yeah….Shit, those guys have guns.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There shooting at something.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Doug?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Turn around quick!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: It’s got to be Doug. Take that guy out!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Doug!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: God, I think I need a holiday.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Some deal you did there!</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: I should have read the fine print. I love you
Holly, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: Come on guy’s lets move it, please.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Where did you steal the car?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s Josh’s.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Cool….Either of you know the way to
Krakow?</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: No, want me to ask a cop?</p>
