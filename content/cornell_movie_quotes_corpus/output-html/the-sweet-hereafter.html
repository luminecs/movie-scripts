<h1 id="the-sweet-hereafter">the-sweet-hereafter</h1>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes? Yes, I’ll accept the charges.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Daddy, it’s me…How are you doing? That’s
great…Where are you? What’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m in a car wash.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: A car wash! Wow, I’ve never talked to you when
you’ve been in a car wash. Make sure you’ve got the windows closed.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Remember that time we were having the car
washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I,
Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Why are you calling me, Zoe?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Why am I calling you? You’re my father. I’m not
supposed to call you? What’s the matter with wanting to talk to you,
Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nothing’s wrong with trying to talk to me,
Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The problem is I have no idea who I’m
talking to right now.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: ’Cause you think I’m stoned, Daddy? ’Cause you
think I’ve got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you’re thinking,
Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Are you wondering if I scored, Daddy, and I’m
calling you for money? That I’m begging? God, I don’t fucking believe
it!</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Daddy! Are you listening to me, Daddy?!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Why can’t you talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I…I just need to know what state you’re in
so I know…how to talk to you…how to act…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.
I know my wife packed one in there…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You always think you’re prepared for these
things.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How old is she?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Almost three.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes, operator, I’m in a strange situation.
I’m calling from my car, and I appear to be stuck in a car wash…A car
wash, yes…Is there anyway you could…Hello?…Hello?…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That was great.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re going to blow everyone away.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You mean it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You don’t sound like one hundred percent
absolutely sure.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I am. Really. It was awesome.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I’m so happy, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No, I…had an accident.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you have a room?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Will you be spending more than a night?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Hard to say. I might have…some business
here.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Are you a reporter?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: You here about the accident?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. I’m a lawyer. I realize this is an
awful time, but it’s important that we talk.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s sit down.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Just the way Dolores gets so excited about
bringing the kids to check out the animals. It’s like the biggest thing
in her life.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Alright, kids. I want you all to listen to
me. Rule number one No one is allowed to stick their fingers into the
cages. I don’t care how cute some of these animals may be, the fact is
they don’t like being here, no matter how many ribbons some of them have
won…</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Kyle Lambston’s a drunk. Nobody likes him.
He’s a nasty piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: In what way?</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Been drinking since high school. Fucked
himself up. Used to be smart enough.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Any criminal record?</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.
Drunk driving. Lost his licence. That’s why he don’t work no more.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Can’t get off that shitty dump they live
on. What little money comes in goes to booze.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How does the family survive?</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Don’t know. Food banks, welfare, church
charity. They scrape by.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What about Doreen?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: She…she was a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: At school. She fell for Kyle just before we
graduated. Got pregnant, and…went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot
Kyle’s dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the
Spread Eagle…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s the local bar?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: …coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped
by his life and blaming her for that…and…</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Taking it out on her.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: He beat her?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You see, to do this right, to actually
have a chance at winning - of getting some money to compensate you for
the loss of your boy - we need folks like you. Sensitive, loving
parents. People with no criminal background or history of trouble in
town. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Now, of all these parents you’ve told me
about whose kids were killed, who would you consider to be good
upstanding neighbors?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: People who will help our cause.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Well, there’s the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly
Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s great, Wendell. That’s the sort of
thing I need to know. So it doesn’t come back to haunt our case later
on.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: There’s the Prescots…</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank
and half the businesses in town. He’s about to lose his house and
car.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: But Charlene…</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Charlene’s over at the Spread Eagle every
other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She’ll go
down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Don’t even think of the Bilodeaus or the
Atwaters. They’re all inbred.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: The Ottos.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Tell me about the Ottos.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was
their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Indian?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s good. Judges like adopted Indian
boys. Tell me more about the Ottos.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: They’re smart. Been to college. They moved
here from the city about a dozen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What do they do?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Crafts.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Crafts?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Wanda does these photographic things. That’s
one of her pictures on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Have they ever been busted?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>wendell</strong>: You don’t know is what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes, I’ll accept the charges.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you mind if I step outside for a
moment? It’s a private call.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Zoe…Zoe, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m not getting any sound.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I’ll find you another pair.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: You can have mine.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Yes, we do know each other. I’m Alison
Jones.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Alison Jones.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Ally. That was my nickname.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Ally. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m just fine, Ally. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I’m fine. Still working with my father.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And what does he do again?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: He used to work with you. Until you found
out he was having an affair with your wife.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Ally Jones.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: How is Mrs. Stephens?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: We’re…not together.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I’d heard that. But she’s well?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes…fine.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: And Zoe? How’s Zoe?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Oh, you’ve beaten me to it.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Hi, Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Well, it’s certainly what you’d call
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You hate it.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: I could wrap it up. Protect the other
kids.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I’ll just strap it on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: It’s for the school bazaar.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh, it’s bizarre alright. C’mon Bear. Let’s
get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Away from your crazy Mom.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The Ottos always waited for the bus with
Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I
guess they’re what you might call hippies.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What do you mean by that,
Mrs. Driscoll?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Dolores. No one calls me
‘Mrs. Driscoll’.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What do you mean by that, Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: About the Ottos?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. What do you mean by ‘hippies’?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I mean, the way they look. Their hair and
clothing…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do they have any reputation for drugs?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what
I’d call model citizens. They’re regular at town meetings. They give
their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various
fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren’t church goers.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And they loved Bear.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out
together to see him off to school. It’s like he was their little
treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That’s a picture of him on the
wall there, behind Abbott.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Those are all from the fair last year.
Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: For rabbits?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He was one of those children that bring out
the best in people. He would have been a wonderful man.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Billy Ansel started honking at us up around
Upper Hat Creek. He always started to do that when he caught up to the
bus. He’d wave at his kids, Jessica and Mason, who always sat at</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: So Billy was driving behind the bus at the
time of the accident?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.
They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It
comforted him.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: From what?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: From what?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Did he have any particular problems that
you knew of? Financial pressures…run-ins with the law…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: No, nothing like that. Billy’s wife, Lydia,
died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by
himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You talked about it?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: No. I saw it on his face.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi…Can you talk? I’m on my way to work…I’m
waving at them now…What’s that noise?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Wendell’s working on the roof. He thinks he’s
fixing a leak. As far as I’m concerned he’s just punching in a few new
holes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nicole’s coming over to look after the kids
tonight. She’ll be there around six.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Billy, that’s too early.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: She said she’s got to be home by nine.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Can’t you make it later?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I’m glad to hear that Zoe’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Are you still in touch?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Not really. The last time I saw her was at
that clinic. That was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Which clinic?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I don’t remember the name. It was near a
beach.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Sunnyridge. That was a long time</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: So there were others?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way
houses, treatment centers, detox units…</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Then…when did she get better?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: She didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: But you said…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s where I’m going. To see her.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: She’s in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. Do you find there’s something strange
about this meat?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Some more wine?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m afraid this meat is overdone.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I’m sorry about that, Mr. Stephens.
Would you like to try the fish?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Poached salmon.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you have a cold plate?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Is there shrimp on it?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: If you could pick the shrimp off, as well
as anything that touches the shrimp…</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I’m not sure if that will leave much on
the plate.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Well, let’s see what we get.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: If you could excuse me for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mrs. Otto, my name is Mitchell Stephens.
The Walkers told me you might be willing to talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m sorry for coming over unannounced like
this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand. I know it’s
an awful time, but it’s important that we talk.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You can’t come here.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Please, let me explain. I’ll only take a
moment of your time.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: We have a guest. What did you say your name
was?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: The Walkers sent him by.</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: You want a cup of tea or something?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: A cup of tea would be nice. Would it be
alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto? I want to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The Walkers spoke very highly of you.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You’ve been retained?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Their child died, and they got a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It should be said that my task is to
represent the Walkers only in their anger. Not their grief.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Who did they get for that?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You are angry, aren’t you, Mrs. Otto?
That’s why I’m here. To give your anger a voice. To be your</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s my belief that Dolores was doing
exactly what she’d been doing for years. Besides, the school board’s
insurance on Dolores is minimal. A few million at the very most. The
really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that
made the bus.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: You think someone else caused the
accident?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mrs. Otto, there is no such thing as an
accident. The word doesn’t mean anything to me. As far as I’m concerned,
somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner. Some corrupt agency
or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a
million dollar out-of-court settlement. They decided to sacrifice a few
lives for the difference. That’s what’s done, Mrs. Otto. I’ve seen it
happen so many times before.</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried
to…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How long has Dolores been driving that
bus, Mr. Otto? How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went
wrong that morning?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Someone calculated ahead of time what it
would cost to sacrifice safety. It’s the darkest, most cynical thing to
imagine, but it’s</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: So you’re just the thing we need.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Isn’t that what you want us to believe? That
we’re completely defenseless? That you know what’s best?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Listen to me, Mrs Otto. Listen very
carefully. I do know what’s best.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Who is responsible for this tragedy. Then,
in your name and the Walkers’ name and the name of whoever decides to
join us, I shall sue. I shall sue for negligence until they bleed.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: I want that person to go to jail. For the
rest of his life. I want him to die there. I don’t want his money.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s unlikely that anyone will go to
prison, Mrs. Otto. But he or his company will pay in other ways. And we
must make them pay. Not for the</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: I didn’t ask if you wanted milk.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No. A little sugar though.</p>
<p><strong>hartley</strong>: We’ve only got honey.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ll…take it straight.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Are you expensive?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: If you agree to have me represent you in
this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I
will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made,
then my services will cost you nothing. It’s a standard agreement.</p>
<p><strong>wanda</strong>: Do you have this agreement with you?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s in my car.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ll just be a minute. Anyhow, you should
discuss this all without me before you make any decision.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ve done everything the loving father of
a drug addict is supposed to do…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: …I’ve sent her to the best hospitals,
she’s seen all the best doctors. It doesn’t matter. Two weeks later
she’s on the street. New York, Vancouver, Pittsburgh, Toronto, L.A. The
next time I hear from her, it’s a phone call scamming for money. Money
for school, or money for a new kind of therapist,</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What…does it turn to?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It turns to steaming piss.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m…so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi, Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They just finished supper.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Was it good?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ll be back around nine.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Have you been waiting long?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A while.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell
if someone’s been smoking.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Does this mean I can’t take a shower?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: No. It should be dry by now.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What time’s he coming home?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: When the game’s over, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover
city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern
side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty…</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What’s a ditty again?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s like a song.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: What’s vermin again?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the
cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of
vats. And licked the soup from the cook’s own ladles, Split open the
kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats, And even
spoiled the women’s chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and
squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats…</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Don’t you usually like to sit at the back?
To wave at your Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: I want to sit beside you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What, Mason?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the
kids into the mountain - why couldn’t he use his pipe to make the people
pay him for getting rid of the rats?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Because…he wanted to them to be
punished.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: The people in the town?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: So he was mean?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No. Not mean. Just…very angry.</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Should I keep reading?</p>
<p><strong>mason</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Tomorrow I’m going to put Sean on the bus. He
won’t want to go. He never does. He’ll cry and want to hold on to
me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s because he misses you.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s natural.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Your kids never cry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, maybe that’s because they know I’m
going to follow them. Behind the bus.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: They can look forward to that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Just like we look forward to this.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: You’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I better get back.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Good night, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It just seems…kind of weird.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nicole, I’m just going to pack all this stuff
and give it to the church for charity. Don’t feel bad. Unless you feel
strange about wearing it.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing
some of this stuff, but…I don’t feel funny about that. I really liked
her.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And she really liked you. She would’ve given
you all this if she’d outgrown it, or…</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What do you mean ‘outgrown it’?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Goodnight, Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What took so long?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Mrs. Ansel’s clothing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Does it fit?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Once more he stept into the street, And to
his lips again Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; And ere he
blew three notes such sweet soft notes as yet musician’s cunning Never
gave the enraptured air - There was a rustling, seemed like a bustling
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling, Small feet were
pattering, wooden shoes clattering,</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,
A wondrous portal opened wide, As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed; And
the Piper advanced and the children followed, And when all were in to
the very last, The door in the mountain-side shut fast…</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Did I say, all? No! One was lame, And could
not dance the whole of the way; And in after years, if you would blame
His sadness, he was used to say,- ’It’s dull in the town since my</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Everything was strange and new.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: By the time I reached the bottom of
Bartlett Hill Road, I had half my load, over twenty kids, aboard.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: They had walked to their places on the main
road from the smaller lanes</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: and private roadways that run off it.
Bright little clusters of three and four children - like berries waiting
to be plucked.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s the way I thought of them
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Berries.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yes. Like I was putting them into my big
basket. Clearing the hillside of its children.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in
the spring.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Berry-picking.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yes. The old-fashioned way.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: With our hands.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Anyhow, my next stop was across from the
Bide-A-Wile, which is owned and operated by Risa and Wendell Walker.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He was behind all the other kids his age in
school and was too fragile and nervous to play sports.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: A strange little fellow, but you couldn’t
help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened
five or six.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Were his parents…attentive to him?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You mentioned that he had a learning
disability.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Did his parents attend to that?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Did they give him special care?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only
child…the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell’s a withdrawn
sort of man. That’s his nature. But Risa, she’s still got dreams.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Morning, Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Hi, Risa. Aren’t your feet freezing?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: I guess they are.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I want to stay with you.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Go on now, Sean. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: C’mon, Sean. Sit next to me.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: No. He’s not sick or anything. It’s just one
of those mornings, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: But I never had ‘those mornings’ myself.
Not so long as I had the schoolbus to drive. Not so long as I had my
kids.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: It emerged from the blowing snow on the
right side of the road. It might have been a dog or a small deer or
maybe even a lost child. It might have been an optical illusion or a
mirage. Whatever it was, for the rest of my life I will remember that
red-brown blur…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Every time I get on one of these flights
to rescue Zoe, I remember the summer we almost lost her. She was three
years old. It happened in the morning, at this cottage we used to rent.
We were all sleeping together in bed. It was a wonderful time in our
lives. We still thought we had a future together, the three of us. Did
you ever visit the cottage?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I…don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I woke to the sound of Zoe’s breathing. It
was laboured. I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all
swollen. I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her
face.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I didn’t know. I was in a panic. I guessed
she’d been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest
hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell. Klara
took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the
hospital. I finally got a doctor on the line. He sounded young, but
cool. He was confident, but there was a nervousness. He have been an
intern. This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like
this. He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just
as scared as I was.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: He surmised that there was a nest of baby
black widow spiders in the mattress. He told me they had to be babies,
or else with Zoe’s body</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Which was true enough, especially at that
moment. Klara was wild-eyed with fear, and her fear was contagious. I
was a better actor than she was, that’s all. Zoe loved us equally then.
Just like she hates us both equally now. The doctor told me that I
should hold her in my lap, and let Klara drive to the hospital. He asked
me to bring a small, sharp knife. It had to be clean. There was no time
to sterilize properly. He explained how to perform an emergency
tracheotomy. How to cut into my daughter’s throat and windpipe without
causing her to bleed to death. He told me there’d be a lot of blood. I
said I didn’t think I could do it. ‘If her throat closes up and stops
her breathing, you’ll have to, Mr. Stephens. You’ll have a minute and a
half, two minutes maybe, and she’ll probably be unconscious when you do
it. But if you can keep her calm and relaxed, if you don’t let her
little heart beat too fast and spread the poison around, then you might
just make it over here first. You get going now’, and he hung up.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It was an unforgettable drive. I was
divided into two people. One part of me was Daddy, singing a lullaby to
his little girl.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The other part was a surgeon, ready to cut
into her throat. I waited for the second that Zoe’s breath stopped to
make that incision.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Nothing. We made it to the hospital. I
didn’t have to go as far as I was prepared to. But I was prepared to go
all the way.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: I knew you’d be here.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Are you going to the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I stopped by the station a while ago. I
stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a
lawyer there. He told me he’d gotten you signed up. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Something made this happen, Billy.
Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Mr. Stephens says that someone didn’t put a
right bolt in the bus…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage.
There’s nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: …or that the guardrail wasn’t strong
enough.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You believe that?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Because I have to.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia’s
dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Why did you do that, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You think that caused the accident, Risa?
That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you’re looking for a
witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they’re the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You know what I’m going to miss? More than
making love? It’s the nights you couldn’t get away from Wendell. It’s
the nights I’d sit in that chair for an hour. Smoking cigarettes and
remembering my life before…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m here about your children,
Mr. Ansel.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: My name is…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mister, I don’t want to know your name.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Not unless you can raise the dead.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Here. You may change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be
likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now? Beat you so bad that
you pissed blood and couldn’t walk for a month. Because that’s what I’m
about to do.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: No, Mr. Ansel. I wouldn’t sue you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Leave us alone, Stephens. Leave the people of
this town alone. You can’t help.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You can help each other. Several people
have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as
an individual will be stronger if I’m allowed to represent you together
as a group.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Case?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The Walkers have agreed. The Ottos. Nicole
Burnell’s parents. It’s important to initiate proceedings right away.
Things get covered up. People lie. That’s why we have to begin our
investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That’s why I’m
out here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn’t
hire a goddamned lawyer. And the Ottos wouldn’t deal</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’re angry, Mr. Ansel. You owe it to
yourself to feel that way. All I’m saying is let me direct your
rage.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s my daughter. Or it may be the
police to tell me that they’ve found her dead. She’s a drug addict.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m telling you this because… we’ve all
lost our children, Mr. Ansel.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: They’re dead to us. They kill each other
in the streets. They wander comatose in shopping malls. They’re
paralyzed in front of televisions. Something terrible has happened
that’s taken our children away. It’s too late. They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I have a question for you,
Mr. Stephens.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What’s that, Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I told you that I was doing fifty miles an
hour when the accident happened. That’s how I remembered it. But the
truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that’s
true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would
happen then?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That would complicate things.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Because I’d be to blame, right?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Billy Ansel will insist that you were
driving fifty-one miles an hour. Just like you’ve done every morning for
the past fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He knows that? Billy?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. He does.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Billy said that?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You’ve talked to Billy?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: And Billy told you that he’ll tell that
to…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mrs. Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not
volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to
testify to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: But in order to do that, you must let me
bring a suit in your name</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It’s clear to me and other people that you
have suffered significantly from this event.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: What other people?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Who’s been talking to you about what I’m
feeling? Who should care about what I’m feeling?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Dolores, people have to know that you’ve
suffered too.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And they won’t understand until you let me
clear your name - your good name - once and for all. Will you let me do
that? Will you let me do my duty?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You heard what Abbott said?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Anything you didn’t understand?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: There might have been a word or two that
slipped by. Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely
sure.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Abbott said that the true jury of a
person’s peers is the people of her town. Only they, the people who have
known her all her life, and not twelve strangers, can decide her guilt
or innocence. And if I have committed a crime, then it’s a crime against
them, so they are the ones who must decide my punishment.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s what he said, is it?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Yes. Abbot understands these things.</p>
<p><strong>dr. robeson</strong>: The mind is kind.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: They say I’m lucky because I can’t remember
the accident.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t even try to remember.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You just think about getting well, Nicole,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just wait till you see what we’ve got waiting
for you at home.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s an incredible relief to be leaving the
hospital. I’m so sick of looking at my doctor, listening to Frankenstein
ask me stupid questions about what I was feeling…</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: He thought it was cute when I called him
Frankenstein. It wasn’t. I feel like his monster.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Isn’t it a lovely day?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What happened to summer?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Summer’s over. It’s fall.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: And winter?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, winter’s far behind us now.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: How was it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We had a terrible winter last year, didn’t we,
Sam?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Good thing I was in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How do you like it, Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The ramp?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Pretty slick, eh?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Very slick.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do you like the colour?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And I had to widen a few doors. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The door needs a lock.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure. I’ll fix it right away.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Can I come and visit you here?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You better. And you can sleep in my new bed
with me too.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That’s too high. I’ll never reach it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh. I better get some spackle.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mommy says you need to lock the boys out.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What boys?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: So do you like your new room?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your Dad spent all his spare time in here. He
wanted to make it absolutely perfect.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I feel like a princess.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Is this mine?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. It’s a present.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: From you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. From Mr. Stephens. That was him on the
phone just now. He was calling to see how you were.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Who’s Mr. Stephens?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s a lawyer. He’s our lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You and Mom have a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, yes. He’s your lawyer too.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t be talking about this just
now, with you barely home. Aren’t you hungry, honey? Want me to fix you
something?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No. What’s this lawyer business?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jenny, why don’t you go and play outside?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: He’s given me some stuff too. Toys, and some
books…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s a very kind man. And he knew that you’d
need a computer for doing schoolwork.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s because of the accident, Nicole. Most
people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers. A lot
of people…well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: But you didn’t lose me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, honey. And we will thank the Lord for that
every day and night</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I can’t walk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re going to need special care for a long
time to come. It’s not going to be easy. Not for you, not for any of us.
Because we love you so much. And it’s going to cost money. More than we
can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What about insurance? Doesn’t insurance pay
for these things?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Partly. But there’s a lot the insurance doesn’t
cover. That’s one of the reasons we have a lawyer. To make sure the
insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: How will he do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several
families. The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.
Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence. He’s sure that the
accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He’s
a very smart man.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That’s the first thing I heard about you.
That you were a smart man.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You’re good at that. Good at getting people
to believe you could do something for them. Something they could never
do for themselves.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s my daughter. Or it may be the
police to tell me that they’ve found her dead. She’s a drug addict.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why are you telling me this?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m telling you this because we’ve all
lost our children, Mr. Ansel…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: They’re dead to us.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes, I’ll accept the charges.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I’m calling because I’ve got some news for you,
Daddy. Some big news.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: News?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Don’t you want to hear?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. Give me your news, Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You always think you know what I’m going to
say, don’t you? You always think you’re two steps ahead of me. The
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Tell me your news, Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Okay. I went to sell blood yesterday. That’s
how it is. I’m in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit
lawyer, and I’m selling my blood.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s not news, Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No. But this is. They wouldn’t take my
blood.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it
register?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I tested positive.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Welcome to hard times, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What do you want me to do, Zoe? I’ll do
whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I need money.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You can’t ask me that! Not anymore! You asked
me what I wanted. Not what I wanted it for. I want money.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you have the blood test?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: You don’t believe me? You don’t fucking believe
me?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Of…course I do. I just thought…I could get
you another</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I like it when you don’t believe me, Daddy.
It’s better you don’t believe me but have to act like you do.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I can hear you breathing, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. I can hear you breathing too.</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: Oh God, I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I love you, Zoe. I’ll be there soon, and
I’ll take care of you. No matter what happens. I’ll take care of
you.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Well, Nicole, I’ve been wanting to meet
you for a long time now. Not just because I’ve heard so many good things
about you, but because, as you know, I’m the guy representing you and
your mom and dad and some other folks here in town. We’re trying to
generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered,
and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again.
You’re central to the case I’m trying to build, Nicole. But you’d
probably just as soon let the whole thing lie. Just get on with your
life as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I don’t like thinking about the accident. I
don’t even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel
sorry for me, and…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You hate that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What she means, Mitch…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: People can’t help it, you know. They
really can’t. When they see you in this wheelchair, knowing what your
life was life eight months ago, people are going to feel sorry for you.
There’s no way around it, Nicole. You and I just met, and already I
admire you. Who wouldn’t? You’re a brave tough smart kid. That’s
obvious. And I didn’t know you, know how exciting and promising</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You can only feel lucky that you didn’t die
for so long. Then you start to feel…unlucky.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That you didn’t die? Like the other
children?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean
and…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nicole!</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: It would be strange if you didn’t feel
that way.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What do you want me to do for you,
Mr. Stephens?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: They work for the people we’re trying to
sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try
to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing
their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I won’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I don’t want you to lie.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The truth is that it was an accident, and no
one’s to blame.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: There’s no such thing as an accident,
Nicole. Not in a situation like this.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: You seem very sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m absolutely positive.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No matter what I’m asked, I’ll tell the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: That’s fine. I want you to be absolutely
truthful. And I’ll be right there to advise and help you. And there’ll
be a court stenographer there to make a record of it, and</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Yes. Dolores…and even your mom and dad.
But I’ll make sure you go last.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: So you can keep on getting well before you
have to go and do this. It’s not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: When do they award damages?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Depends. This could drag on for quite a
while. But we’ll be there at the end, Sam. Don’t you worry.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: At that moment, I hated my parents - Daddy
for what he knew and had done,</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: and even Mom for what she didn’t know and
hadn’t done. You told me it wasn’t going to be easy. But as I sat there,
staring at Daddy, I knew it was going to be the easiest thing in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>risa</strong>: Go on now. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: C’mon, Sean, sit next to me.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: He never took his eyes off his mother, even
as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Why would he be frightened?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I don’t know. But it was weird in terms of
what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I shut the door with one hand, and released
the brake with the other, and waited for a second for Risa to cross in
front of the bus. There was a sixteen wheeler behind me, and I heard his
air brakes hiss as the driver chunked into gear. I looked into the side
view mirror, and saw him move into line behind me. Then suddenly Sean
shrieked…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: What happened then?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Sean was all over me, scrambling across my
lap to the window. I glimpsed Risa off to my left, leaping out of the
way of a red Saab that seemed to have bolted out of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Sean! Sit down! Your Mom’s okay! Now sit
down!</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: You get his number?</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: She was shaken, standing there with her
arms wrapped around herself.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: She shook her head, turned away, and walked
slowly back to the office. I drew a couple of breaths and checked Sean,
who was seated now but still craning and looking after his mother.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,
Joining the town and just at hand, Where waters gushed and fruit-trees
grew, And flowers put forth a fairer hue, And everything was strange and
new…</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: I remember wrenching the steering wheel to
the right and slapping my foot against the brake petal. I wasn’t the
driver anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: The bus was like this huge wave about to
break over us. Bear Otto, the Lambston kids, the Hamiltons, the
Prescotts, the teenaged boys and girls from Bartlett Hill, Sean, Nicole
Burnell, Billy Ansel’s twins, Jessica and Mason…all the children of my
town.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to
come over to talk to us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did he say what about?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Was he drinking? Could you tell?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jenny, it’s time for you to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on, Jen. I let you watch your nature
show.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is he coming over now? Right away?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you up to, Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing good on your T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: As opposed to this T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Besides, I’d like to see Billy.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: That wasn’t true. I didn’t want to be seen
by anyone whose kids had been killed by the accident. Especially not
Billy Ansel.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Actually, now that I think about it, I’d
just as soon stay in my room.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I remembered all the times I had tucked
Jessica and Mason into bed. How they loved to have me read to them
before they slept. There was nothing for me to say to Billy, except I’m
sorry. I’m sorry that your children died when my parent’s children
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, Billy! What brings you out on a night like
this? C’mon in. Take a load off.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There’s a
piece of cake left.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. No, thanks, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So what brings you out tonight?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the
truth. It’s this lawsuit you’ve gotten yourself all involved with. I
want you to drop the damned thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t see how that concerns you, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It does concern me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I don’t know why it should. There’s a
whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits. We’re hardly unique
here, Billy. I mean, I can understand how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, it being so depressing and all. But it’s
reality. You can’t just turn this off because you happen to think it’s a
bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Because it’s what we have to do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well I don’t want a damned thing to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay, fine. So…stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ve tried to stay out of it. But it turns
out that’s not so easy, Sam. You’ve gone and got yourself this lawyer.
Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So? I mean, lot’s of folks have got
lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But yours is the one who’s going to subpoena
me, Sam. Force me to testify in court. He came by the garage this
afternoon. Gave me this piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why would he do that? You didn’t have anything
to do with the accident.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.
Because I saw it. I saw it happen…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: If that bastard does subpoena me, if he
forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line
up behind him and try and do the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That won’t happen, Billy. Mitch Stephens’ case
is small, compared to some of those other guys. The way he told me, all
he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the
bus. I know it’s a painful thing to do, but it’ll only take a few
minutes of your time. That’ll be the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s wrong, Sam. You know that. We’ll be
tangled up in this thing for the next five years. This is never going to
go away…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: C’mon, you know that won’t…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ve got lawyers suing lawyers because some
people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.
We’ve got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over
percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.
The rescue squad. Because they didn’t act fast enough.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: If you two dropped the case, then the others
would come to their senses</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: and follow. You’re good sensible parents, you
and Mary. People respect you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, Billy. We can’t drop the lawsuit. You know
how much we need the money.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why? You got money from Dolores’ insurance
with the school board. We all did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s not enough. For hospital bills. For
Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’ll help pay for Nicole, if that’s what
you’re really talking about. I’ll even give you the money I got for my
kids. That’s what we used to do, remember? Help each other. This was a
community.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I used to like it here. I used to care about
what happened. Now I think I’ll sell my house and move the fuck
away.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Billy, please. The children.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The children.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How is Nicole? Is she around?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s resting. In her room.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Say hello for me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’re getting on with our lives, Billy. Maybe
it’s time you got on with yours.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make
your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I’d take you over.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You seem…I don’t know…well, distant, I guess.
Hard to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I mean I’m a wheelchair girl now. It’s hard
to pretend I’m a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me.
Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where
are they now?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: He couldn’t look at me. But I looked at him.
Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not
anymore. Now, I owned it completely.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, okay. I’ll take you about nine-thirty in
the morning. That’s okay with you?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Before, everything had been so confusing. I
never knew who was to blame. But now I know. He’s just a thief, a sneaky
thief who had robbed his daughter. Robbed me of…whatever it was that my
sister still had and I didn’t. And then the accident robbed me of my
body.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The last time I was in the community hall
was for the big Christmas party almost a year ago. It hadn’t
changed.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Now on that morning, did there come a
time, Nicole, when you left your parents’ house?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: What time in the morning was this?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: About eight-thirty in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Was anyone waiting for the bus with
you?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick
and stayed home that day.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Was there anything unusual about the
driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Like what? I mean, I don’t remember a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I object to the form of that question.
Note that.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Was the bus on time?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: And where did you sit that morning?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: My usual place. On the right side. The first
seat.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: And according to your recollection, there
was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It was when Sean Walker got on. He was
crying and didn’t want to leave his mother. Mason Ansel was sitting
beside me. I asked him to move, so I could quiet Sean down. When the bus
started up, a car came around</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: And was this incident caused in any way by
anything the driver of the bus did?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No, she hadn’t even started to move the bus.
It was the car’s fault.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: There was nothing reckless in
Mrs. Driscoll’s behavior?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I object to that form of question. Note
that.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Did there come a time when all the
children had been picked up?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You remember that much?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: As I’m talking, I’m remembering more about
it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Note my objection. She said, ‘As I’m
talking.’</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Did there come a time when the bus turned
off Staples Mill Road onto</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: There was a brown dog that ran across the
road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit
him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned
onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I’m remembering it
pretty clearly.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Note that she said ‘pretty clearly’. Not
‘clearly’.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: And what was the weather like at this
time?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: It was snowing.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Unless the report from the National
Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I
will object to that question.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: I will offer that report. Well, then, now
that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you
observed at that time?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Before the actual accident?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I was scared.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Why were you scared?</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: This is before the accident, Nicole. Do
you understand what I’m asking?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Why were you scared?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Dolores was driving too fast.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What
made you think that, Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: The speedometer. And it was downhill
there.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You could see the speedometer?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It
seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was
going? To the best of your recollection?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Seventy-two miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Seventy-two miles an hour? You’re sure of
this?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You believe that the bus driven by
Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I told you I was positive. The speedometer
was large and easy to see from where I was.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You saw the speedometer?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I was scared. And there wasn’t time.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: There wasn’t time?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: No. Because the bus went off the road. And
crashed.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: You remember this?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Yes. I do now. Now that I’m telling it.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: What do you remember about the
accident?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly
swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the
side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and
everyone was screaming and everything. And that’s all. I guess I was
unconscious after that. That’s all. Then I was in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Do you have any questions,
Mr. Stephens?</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his
mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something. Like what, Daddy?
Like ‘What about my money?’</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I have no questions.</p>
<p><strong>schwartz</strong>: Thank you, Nicole.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’d make a great poker player, kid.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Let’s go, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Daddy took a long time. I guess he wanted to
have a few words with you. He must have tried to tell you that I was
lying. Then you would tell Daddy that it didn’t matter if I was lying or
not, the lawsuit is dead.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Everyone’s lawsuit is dead. Forget it. Tell
the others to forget it. It’s over. Right now, Sam, the thing you’ve got
to worry about is why she lied. A kid who’d do that to her own father is
not normal, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: But Daddy knows who lied. He knows who the
liar is. He knows who’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I hope he lets us keep the computer.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I’d like an ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Well, it was nice meeting you again,
Mr. Stephens.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Mitchell. It was nice to see you again,
Ally.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Alison.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Alison.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Say hi to Zoe.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: I hope she gets better.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ll tell her that.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Daddy, can we come to the fair?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: How about Sunday night? That’s always the
best time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: What’s going to happen to Dolores?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Will the police do anything to her?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s too late for that. She can’t drive the bus
anymore. The school board saw to that right off.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: She’ll move away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There’s talk of that.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace
strange and new.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: As you see each other, almost two years
later, I wonder if you realize something.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: I wonder if you realize that all of us -
Dolores, me, the children who survived, the children who didn’t - that
we’re all citizens of a different town now.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: A town of people living in the sweet
hereafter.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: Whether others defend us, protect us, love
us or hate us - they do it to meet their own needs, not ours.</p>
<p><strong>nicole</strong>: This is what I learned. This is what I found
out.</p>
