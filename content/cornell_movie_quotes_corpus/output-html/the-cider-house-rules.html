<h1 id="the-cider-house-rules">the-cider-house-rules</h1>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: In other parts of the world, young men of
promise leave home to make their fortunes, battle evil, or solve the
problems of the world.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I was myself such a young man, when I came to
save the orphanage in St. Cloud’s… many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Here in St. Cloud’s, I have come to
understand that promises are rarely kept, that the battle isn’t so much
against evil as ignorance, and that being successful can’t hold a candle
to being of use.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Nor have I solved the problem I came here to
solve.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Even in the most enlightened times, unwanted
babies will manage to be born. That there will always be orphans is
simple not a problem to be solved. Here is St. Cloud’s, we don’t regard
the sordid facts of life as problems.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: In truth, we’ve only had one real
problem.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: His name was Homer Wells.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I named him after the Greek writer. You know
Homer, of course?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I made his name “Wells” because I could tell
he was very deep.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: In truth, Nurse Angela named him– her father
drilled wells, and “Homer” was one of her family’s umpteen cats.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “Good night, you Princes of Maine, you Kings
of New England!”</p>
<p><strong>adopting mother</strong>: There’s something wrong with him!
He never makes a sound.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He didn’t cry enough for them, if you can
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>adopting father</strong>: Do you think we could have a look
at someone a little different?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Thus was Homer Wells returned. He was too
happy a baby.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: The second family has an unfortunate gift for
getting sounds out of Homer.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: The rumor was true. They beat him. He
couldn’t stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Here is St. Cloud’s, I try to consider, with
each rule I make or break, that my first priority is an orphan’s
future.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Easier said than done.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I told the third family to take good
care–this was a special boy.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It was Homer who took too much good care of
himself.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Don’t be frightened. Everyone is nice
here.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: Do you live here?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I just belong here.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: What could I do with him? He kept coming
back!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Homer, if you’re going to stay at
St. Cloud’s, I expect you to be of use.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: But, in failing to withhold love, had I
created a true and everlasting orphan? I had been too successful with
Homer Wells. I had managed to make the orphanage his home.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: God forgive me. I have made an orphan by
loving him too much. Homer Wells will belong to St. Cloud’s,
forever.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: We’ve got two new patients, one to
deliver.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: First pregnancy?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yes, for both.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I presume you’d prefer handling the
delivery.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: All I said was, I don’t want to perform
abortions. I have no argument with you performing them.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You know how to help these women– how can you
not feel obligated to help them when they can’t get help anywhere
else?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: One: it’s illegal. Two: I didn’t ask how to
do it–you just showed me.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: What else could I have showed you, Homer? The
only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you’ve got to
be of use.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Have you ever had ether, Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Once, when they took out my appendix.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: No one’s touched your appendix.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Whatever it was… the ether made me
sick.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It won’t make you sick this time, Dorothy–not
the way I do it, just a drop at a time.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I can’t pay for this, you know–I got no
money.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: One day, Dorothy, if you have any money, a
donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Only if you can afford it.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That was good, Carla–that was perfect.
Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I don’t wanna see it!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You don’t have to see it, dear. Don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I don’t even wanna know what sex it is–don’t
tell me!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: We won’t tell you, Carla. You’re going to be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Your baby’s going to be okay, too.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I don’t wanna know!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He’s a big boy!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Let me see him, for Christ’s sake–I wanna see
him.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Would you mind having a look at Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: There was no visible wound?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was
virtually disintegrating–my stitches pulled right through the
tissue!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It looks like scurvy.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time
sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or
vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn’t a sailor!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She’s a prostitute, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Did you look in her purse?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I looked everywhere else!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s called French Lunar Solution.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It’s not ergot, it’s not pituitary extract,
it’s not oil of rue…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It claims to restore monthly regularity.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s obviously an aborticide.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Christ, it’s oil of tansy!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: If you take enough of it, your intestines
lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: In other words, scurvy.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself
“not a doctor”! Keep an eye on her–she’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Take care of that, will you?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He sniffs that ether! I’ve seen him do
it!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s because he’s too tired to sleep. He has
to.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He smells like he could put you to
sleep!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: He’s a doctor, Buster–doctors smell like
ether.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: You’re a doctor, Homer–you don’t smell like
ether.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m not a doctor. I haven’t been to medical
school–I haven’t even been to high school!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: But you’ve studied with the old man for
years!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m not a doctor!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I’m sorry, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there’s
something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem
susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I haven’t read that.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I haven’t, either. But you will. The morons
who write the books should do a little research here.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: But isn’t Fuzzy just… well,
underdeveloped?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: When doesn’t he have bronchitis? I wouldn’t
call his bronchial infections “underdeveloped.” Would you?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What is it, Mary Agnes?</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Did you bite it?</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It looks like you bit it–it’ll be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit
me.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: I must have been dreaming of kissing
someone.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Story time, Fuzzy!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “Oh Lord, support us all the day long…”</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “…until the shadows lengthen and the evening
comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and
our work is done.”</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “Then in Thy mercy grant us save lodging, and
holy rest, and peace at the last.”</p>
<p><strong>all the girls</strong>: Amen! Amen! Amen!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “A dog, which had lain concealed till now,
ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and
collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man’s
shoulders.”</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “Missing his aim, he fell into a ditch,
turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a
stone, dashed his brains out.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings
of New England!</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Why does Dr. Larch do tht every night?</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Maybe to scare us…</p>
<p><strong>copperfield</strong>: No, you jerk.</p>
<p><strong>steerforth</strong>: Dr. Larch loves us!</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: But why does he do that?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: He does it because we like it.</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: Buster is mine. You two get Copperfield
and Curly. Nobody touches Fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Stop it! No fighting! Share the snowballs!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: They’re our snowballs! They stole them!</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: They attacked us–just like the Japs!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Listen to you, Fuzzy! You’ve been running. You
get to the shower!</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: I know the type–they’ll take one of the
babies.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in
your office.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Life is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Where’s the name sheet?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Nobody’s named this one yet.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It’s my turn!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Henceforth you shall be… Little Dorrit!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: He doesn’t like it. He’s a boy, That’s
why.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Can’t a boy be a Dorrit?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You do it then.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Henceforth you shall be… Little Wilbur.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I’m not crazy about the “Little…”</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay, he’s just a Wilbur then.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: We haven’t had a Wilbur here in a year or so,
have we? We used to have dozens!</p>
<p><strong>copperfield</strong>: They picked Hazel! The idiots chose
Hazel!</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: If people want to adopt one of us, they
should have to take the oldest first.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Please, Mary Agnes! This is Hazel’s special
day–don’t make her feel sad.</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: Hazel’s practically the youngest of us.
She should be the last to leave!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: At least Hazel can talk. Usually they take
one of the stupid babies.</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: They take the babies so they won’t ever
have to tell them that they were orphans!</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: I’m not a baby!</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: If you cry, Hazel, they’ll just send you
back.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Mary Agnes, that’s not true!</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: That’s what they did to me!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You wanted to come back–that’s why you cried.
You can cry if you feel like it, Hazel. You cry as much as you want.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It is strictly for our orphans’ sake that I
destroy any record of their natural mothers. Of course they will, one
day, want to know. But orphans, especially, should look forward to their
futures. Not back to their pasts.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Hi, Curly. You going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: I thought they might take me.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: They wanted a girl.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Nobody ever wants me!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You’re one of the best, Curly–we couldn’t let
just anyone take you.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Dr. Larch wouldn’t let just anyone take any
of us!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Nobody’s asked for me, have they?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Nobody special enough, Curly.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: You mean somebody asked?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Only the right people can have you,
Curly.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has found a
family. Good night, Hazel.</p>
<p><strong>the girls</strong>: Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel!
Good night, Hazel!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you
were!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You weren’t dreaming about me.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I was!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Then I wasn’t beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You were! You are! It was fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It was just the ether, Wilbur…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Are you okay? Can I get you anything?</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: No one but me ever put a hand on
me, to feel that baby. Don’t you want to touch it or put your ear down
to it?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: Put your ear there. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: You shouldn’t have a baby if
there’s no one who wants to put his face right there!</p>
<p><strong>distraught woman</strong>: Stay right there. Right where you
are. Stay right here. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Do you ever think about leaving this place
to go find them?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I mean your parents.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know who you mean. I think about leaving
here, but not to find them.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Whoever they were, they didn’t do any of the
things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse
Edna, and Nurse Angela.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet
mine, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What for, Buster? What would you do if you
met them?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Uh… I’d like to show them that I can cook, a
little.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You cook very well!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: And that I can drive a truck!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Better than I can!</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill
them. Just sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Homer, you know I would never kill
anyone–you know I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I doubt it. She’s just an…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: …emotional girl.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: What’s she so emotional about?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t know. She got left here, like the
rest of us, didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: He thinks she’s his mother!</p>
<p><strong>copperfield</strong>: He doesn’t think she’s his mother,
Fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: He does so! He loves her!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: How could she be his mother?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: They want to replace me! The Board of
Trustees wants to replace me!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: They just want you to hire some new
help.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Some new things would be useful. I don’t need
any “new help.”</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Homer! I need you!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I thought you took care of this. It always
breaks in the same place. It’s your splice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s your splice! You blame me for
everything!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Angela, we need a new movie, a new projector,
a new typewriter–that’s what they should replace around here!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: We have a delivery. Imminent, in my
estimation…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Homer, would you get this one?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: She’s a patient, right? She should see a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Homer, you are a skilled and gifted surgeon.
You have near-prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I just mean I’d rather fix the movie.
Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Sure. Okay. You splice. I’ll deliver.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Homer… doesn’t King Kong think the woman is
his mother?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Uh, sure–that’s what Kong thinks, all
right.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: That’s why Kong loves her!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I thought it was my turn.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It is. I’ll get this. You go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of
my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these
pages must show.”</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “I was a posthumous child. My father’s eyes
had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on
it.”</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: His father’s dead, right?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: That’s right, Fuzz.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “There is something strange to me, even now,
in the reflection that he never saw me…”</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Is your father dead?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Cirrhosis–it’s a disease of the liver.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Liver killed him?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Alcohol killed him–he drank himself to
death.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: But did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew
him.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Did you know your mother better?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: She’s dead now, too. She was a nanny.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: What’s a nanny do?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: She looks after other people’s children.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Did you grow up around here?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: No. She was an immigrant.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: What’s an immigrant?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Someone not from Maine.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: No one’s going to hurt you, dear. Have you
come to visit us? We have beds, you know. Have you had any breakfast?
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Her temperature is a hundred and four.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: How old are you, dear? Thirteen?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Twelve? Are you twelve, dear? You have to
tell me how long you’ve been pregnant. Three months?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Are you four months pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: She’s at least five.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Dear child, it won’t hurt when I look. I’m
just going to look.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Tell me: you haven’t done something to
yourself, have you?</p>
<p><strong>twelve-year-old girl</strong>: It wasn’t me!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Did you go to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>twelve-year-old girl</strong>: He said he was a doctor. I
would never have stuck that inside me!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Stuck what inside you?</p>
<p><strong>twelve-year-old girl</strong>: It wasn’t me! I would never do
no such thing! I wouldn’t stick that inside me! It wasn’t me!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Listen, you’ve been very brave. I’m going to
put you to sleep–you won’t feel it anymore. You’ve been brave
enough.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: That’s a heavy sedation.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You bet it’s a heavy sedation! The fetus is
unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and
there’s a foreign object. I think it’s a crochet hook.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: If she’d come to you four months ago and
asked you for a simple D and C, what would you have decided to do?
Nothing? This is what doing nothing gets you, Homer. It means that
someone else is going to do the job–some moron who doesn’t know how!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I wish you’d come to me, dear child. You
should have come to me, instead.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: What’d she die of?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: She died of secrecy, she died of
ignorance…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: If you expect people to be responsible for
their children, you have to give them the right to decide whether or not
to have children. Wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How about expecting people to be responsible
enough to control themselves to begin with?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: How about this child? You expect her to be
responsible?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I didn’t mean her. I’m talking about… adults.
You know who I mean!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It’s just a marvel to me that you still have
such high expectations of people.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m happy I amuse you.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Try to look at it this way. What choice does
Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Try to look at it this way. Buster and I are
sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the
incinerator!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Happy to be alive, under any circumstances–is
that your point?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Happy to be alive… I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: So many children. Are they all orphans?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, this is an orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Oh, they’re getting into the car… watch your
fingers!</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: I’m the best.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: The best? Wow! The best at what?</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: I’m the best one.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Here, blow…</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: I really am the best, I just have a cold.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Blow! There, I bet that feels better.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Curly, come here!</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Tell them! I’m the one.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m sorry. They’re not used to seeing a car
like this.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s okay–I don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: We brought some chocolates for the kids.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Chocolates. How thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: I’m the best! Tell them!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You’re the best, Curly.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: So, Mrs…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Candy. Candy Kendall.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Wally. Wally Worthington.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How many months are you?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: So, now, uh… you’re not… I mean, do you do
the–</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No. Dr. Larch will be performing the
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Ah, well… okay. Good! I just wondered…</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said this one is
your turn.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Oh, dear–I’m sorry. I meant the circumcision.
That boy you delivered on Tuesday…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I’ll get started.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I think it was the ether–the smell got to me.
God. This is all my fault.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Steerforth got into the pantry–he’s eaten all
the pie dough.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: He wasn’t sharing it, either.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: He’s down the hall, throwing up.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What kind of plane are you flying?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: A B-24 Liberator.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Liberator…</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Have you enlisted?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: They wouldn’t take me. I’m Class IV– I’ve got
a heart defect.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Really! Is it serious?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No, it’s not serious. I’m just not supposed
to get excited. You know– no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Oh, well. I don’t imagine there’s any strain
or stress around here!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: How is she doing?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Just fine.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Boy or girl?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It was nothing–it’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s all over, honey.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I would like to have a baby, one day. I
really would.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why, of course–you can have as many children
as you want. I’m sure you’ll have very beautiful children.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You’ll have Princes of Maine! You’ll have
Kings of New England!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I suggest you find yourself some fresh air,
Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Homer, when is Halloween?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Uh… it’s the end of October.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Is that soon?</p>
<p><strong>steerforth</strong>: That’s a few months away, Fuzz. I still
don’t feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Oh. It’s the best time! How come we only get
pumpkins once a year?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Don’t get too excited, Fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>fuzzy</strong>: Why can’t we have pumpkins for Christmas,
too? We don’t get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Has anyone offered you anything to eat?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Actually, someone did. I just didn’t think I
could eat anything.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I wonder if you might give me a ride.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Sure! Be glad to! Uh… a ride where?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: We’re heading back to Cape Kenneth.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Cape Kenneth…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That sounds fine.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Doubtless you’ll let me know what immensely
worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I wasn’t intending to leave here in order to
be entirely useless–I expect I’ll find some ways to be of use.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: In other parts of the world, I suppose there
are other ways.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Are you really so stupid that you imagine
you’re going to find a more gratifying life? What you’re going to find
is people like the poor people who get left here–only nobody takes care
of them as well! And you won’t be able to take care of them, either.
There’s no taking care of anybody– not out there!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You know I’m grateful for everything you’ve
done for me…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I don’t need your gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t need this–I know all about my
condition.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: It’s your heart–you ought to take it with
you.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Going where? Does he have a plan of some
kind?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Will he be back soon?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I don’t know! He’s just leaving– you’re the
one who says he needs to see the world! That’s what he’ll do–he’ll see
the world!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: He’s leaving…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: He’ll need clothes… some money…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Let him try to make some money! That’s part
of “seeing the world,” isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to
happen. He’s a young man.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He’s still a boy–out in the world, he’s still
a boy.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could
use some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I think these will fit you.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You’ll need some money–just a little
something, until you find a job.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I’m okay–I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I don’t want you to walk–I want to carry you.
Should I put the top up? It might get cold.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No–keep it down. I want to feel the air.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Coming with us? It’s always a good idea to
have a doctor along for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I have to go, Curly. I’m sorry. I couldn’t
find Buster. Will you tell him…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Let us be happy for Homer Wells…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Homer Wells has found a family. Good night,
Homer!</p>
<p><strong>all the boys</strong>: Good night, Homer!</p>
<p><strong>all the boys</strong>: Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer!
Good night, Homer Wells!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Actually, the Army has given me leave twice.
First when my father died, and now I’m on leave to help my mother– I’m
just trying to get her ready for the harvest. She’s no farmer. Apples
were my dad’s business. And with the war on, she’s short on pickers.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Wally thinks apples are boring.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I never said they were boring.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You said, “Apples aren’t exactly flying.”</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, they aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I think I’d probably like the apple
business.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You’re a little overqualified, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No, I’m not. I need a job.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking
apples is truly boring.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: There! You said it was boring.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Well, picking them is! It’s about as exciting
as… walking!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Is your family in the apple business,
too?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No, but I work there–I like it. My dad’s a
lobsterman.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’ve never seen a lobster.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’ve never seen the ocean, either.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You’ve never seen the ocean?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: That’s not funny… that’s serious.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I couldn’t have a baby with someone who’s
leaving me–I didn’t know what else to do!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He’s going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay!
They’re going to be shooting at him!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Where’s Mandalay?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Burma!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I can’t have a baby alone. I don’t even know
if he’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Honey, honey… of course I’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You don’t know, Wally. You have no idea!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: This is all normal. Don’t worry. The abortion
procedure… it affects you. It’s the ether, too. It’ll take a little
time.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I don’t have any time. There’s a war!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s all very normal.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You ought to cut that shit out–it’s terrible
for you.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I’m a little worried about the… …about how
much bleeding is okay.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come
back again. You have cramps? They’ll ease up, almost entirely. As long
as the bleeding isn’t heavy, it’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Catch!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Give it here!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: What was that?! Come over here!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s called the Burma run. It’s about a
seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Burma run” because you fly over Burma…</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: And over the Himalayas. That’s called flying
over the hump.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: At what altitude?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I’ve got thirty-five minutes to climb to
fifteen thousand feet–that’s the first mountain pass.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What lousy luck–I mean your orders… to draw
an assignment like that!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Actually, I volunteered.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s the flying, right? You love to fly,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I love the bombing, too. But there’s also the
Himalayas–they have the most wicked air currents in the world. I
wouldn’t miss flying there for anything.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Uh, look… if you’re serious about wanting a
job, picking apples isn’t that boring.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Oh, I would love that, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I guess I’ll see you around the orchards.
Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Sure… I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I love you, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I love you, too. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Come on. You have to meet my mom. If it comes
up, I’ve been at a wedding. That’s where I met you, at the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Wally? I expected you earlier…</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: This is Homer Wells–he’s the most
overqualified apple picker you’ll ever meet, but he’s dying to learn the
apple business.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: How do you do, Homer Wells…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How do you do…</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Were you a friend of the bride or the
groom?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Homer is everybody’s friend, Mom… the
bride’s, the groom’s, mine, Candy’s, everybody’s.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Well, perhaps you’ll come to dinner,
Homer…</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Not tonight, Mom–he’s got to meet
Mr. Rose!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You already used up the hot water!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: You’re usin’ my soap, ain’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I ain’t usin’ no soap–it’s too cold to bother
with soap!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: There ain’t never enough hot water, soap or
no soap.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: They’re migrants.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Migrants?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel
up and down the coast with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you
have to let him be the boss.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: That sink’s backed up again, Wally. I
thought you was gonna get me a plumber.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Rose, this is Homer–Homer, this is Mr. Rose’s
daughter, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Rose Rose?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Pretty, ain’t it? You a plumber?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: No, no–Homer is a new picker. He’s going to
stay here with you.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: He’s stayin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That daughter of mine sure is Miss
Hospitality, ain’t she, Wally?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You got lots of experience pickin’, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Homer’s got no experience, Arthur, but he’s
smarter then I am. He’s a fast learner.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: This is history. Ain’t that what you’re
sayin’, Wally? I guess we makin’ history… havin’ this young man stay
with us!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: So. What should I do now?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Out back, there’s a shed. It’s just a
mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in
there.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: If you’re as smart as Wally says, you know
you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You did a good job with that shed,
Homer.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: What kind of a name is Homer?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s the name of a cat. Originally. Well, not
originally.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Now, now–we all got names, sensible or
not. Peaches is from Georgia, where we met him pickin’ peaches. He’s
still better with peaches than hs is with apples. Jack here is new. And
this here is Hero, ’cause he was a hero of some kind or other once.
Ain’t that right, Hero?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: And this here sensitive-lookin’ fella is
Muddy. The less said about Muddy, the better. Ain’t that right,
Muddy?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s just my heart.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: What you got a picture of your heart
for?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: There’s a little something wrong with it.
Just this part here–the right ventricle. It’s slightly enlarged.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yes, so what. It’s nothing serious, really.
Just a small defect.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: It’s big enough to keep you out of the
war, I suppose. Ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: They told me I was too old to serve.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: They told Muddy his feet was too flat!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: And you was “generally unfit,” as I
recall.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Do you like to read?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I can’t read. Nobody taught me.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: What does it say there?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “I looked at the stars, and considered how
awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to
death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.”</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: More?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Since you’re the one who’s smart enough to
read… what’s this?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s a list of rules, it seems.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Whose rules?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: They’re for us, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go on and read ’em, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “One. Please don’t smoke in bed.”</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: It’s too late for that one!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Stop it, Homer. They aren’t our rules. We
didn’t write them. I don’t see no reason to read them.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings
of New England.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Remember this! In the morning, when the tall
grass is wet, you can make the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you feel
it?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s almost like flying.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What about the trees?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: The trees are flak–antiaircraft fire from
those geeks on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I was just showing Homer the orchards… kind
of a geography lesson.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I know what you’ve been doing.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You’ve been giving him a flying lesson!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: He loved it! Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah, it was great.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He thinks people like to get whacked by
branches.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Homer liked it! Didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah, sure. There’s no stress or strain
around here…</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s Vernon. You best stay away from him
until he gets to know you better–then you best stay away from him
more!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Out lieutenant’s calling you, Homer. Mind
your ass.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You getting along okay?</p>
<p><strong>big dot</strong>: Where is that Candy?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Did she leave you, Wally?</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: Who’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy leaves
you!</p>
<p><strong>big dot</strong>: Wally’s gonna marry me if Candy leaves
him!</p>
<p><strong>debra</strong>: You can marry all three of us, Wally!</p>
<p><strong>florence</strong>: We can take turns.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You girls make it hard for a guy to go off to
war. But I’ll leave my best man here to pinch-hit for me.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Uh… I’m shipping out sooner than I thought. I
just wanted to be sure you were settled in–and happy enough,
considering… Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Uh… actually, picking apples is as much
excitement as I want for a while. I’m grateful for the job.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You’re the one who’s helping me, Homer.
You’re going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I’m gone.
Candy, too.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Well, sure… that’s good, then. All I mean is,
I’m lucky I met you.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I don’t think so, Homer. I’m the lucky
one.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You want to fight about it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You pickin’ more cider apples then
anythin’ else. Them drops is good only for cider. And you pickin’ the
stems with the apples only half the time. They good only for cider, too–
if you don’t pick them stems. The rule is, you wanna pick the apple with
the stem, Homer. And see here… see that bud that’s just above the stem?
That’s the bud for next year’s apple–that’s called the spur. You pick
the spur, you pickin’ two years in one–you pickin’ next year’s apple
’fore it have a chance to grow. You leave that on the branch, you
hear?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s better. I can tell you got yourself
some education. Them’s good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got,
they know what they’re doin’– ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I guess so…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wilbur! Wilbur!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wilbur, you should read this.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s from the Board. Another letter.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Uh… “merely suggesting that some new blood
might benefit you all… someone with new ideas in the obstetrical and
pediatric fields.” I think they’re just testing some ideas for our next
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Dr. Holtz seems nice. I think he only wants to
help…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He is a goddamn psychiatrist–of course he
wants to “help”! He’d be happy if he could help commit me!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be
careful of, Wilbur.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: One has to be more than “careful” of
Mrs. Goodhall–she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own
country! I’d like to give her a little ether.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: So what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2,
1915…”</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Homer was born here, in, what was it,
1922?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “…graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and
Harvard School of Medicine, 1939.”</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This is your life story, Wilbur! You just
changed the dates!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: “An internship and two years of training at
the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an
accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced
in pediatric care…”</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You invented him! You’ve completely made his
up!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Don’t you understand? The board is going to
replace me! That’s what the “new blood” is for!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: You mean they’ll replace you with someone who
won’t perform abortions.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Well, we can only guess about that, Edna.
They are against the law.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: These credentials are against the law!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: We all know who trained Homer–his credentials
are as good as mine are. Don’t you be holy to me about the law! What has
the law done for any of us here?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: So here is my candidate. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: But what about school records? Homer doesn’t
have any diplomas…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He will have them, Edna.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, Wilbur, I don’t know… We don’t even know
where he is!</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Where’s that Homer?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Now, now. He’s a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shit. We don’t know what he is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Jack, you gotta watch your language ’round
my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Here he is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Where’s your manners? Make room for Homer,
so’s he can enjoy the view.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: What view?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Are we supposed to be up here? The rules
said…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Homer, you the only one who’s read them
rules, so you the only one who feels like he’s doin’ somethin’
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: What view?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Well, Muddy, we can look at all these
angry stars Homer’s been readin’ to us about.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I bet the view looks better from the
Worthin’tons’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You think so, Jack? Well… I wouldn’t want
to be in that Wally’s shoes tonight.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Daddy, I’d like to be in that Wally’s
shoes every night.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You lucky you in your work boots tonight,
girl…</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: What’s lucky about that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You know where that Wally is tonight,
darlin’? He’s up there in them angry stars. He’s flyin’ all around up
there… with them Japs shooting at him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: They all on board, Mrs. Worthin’ton.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Thank you, Arthur. And how is our Homer
working out?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Oh, he’s a smart young man, most of the
time–Wally was right about him.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: No rotten apples?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: speaking that they</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Rose… dear girl, I’m sure I can find you some
other clothes. You must have some things that would fit her.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I have a ton of things that would fit
you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Now, now, Candy–this girl don’t need no
more clothes, not for pickin’.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Arthur, there’s no such thing as a young
woman who’s got all the clothes she needs.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: So. Not bored yet?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m never bored! It’s all very… different for
me… here.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Uh… have you been feeling okay?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: When I’m not thinking about Wally. I’m not
good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant… yes, I’m fine. I… …I don’t
suppose you’ve seen a lobster yet.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You have to come to my dad’s lobster pound
and see one, then.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I better go.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I don’t think Mr. Rose would leave without
you.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Come next week!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Whoa–look at that Homer! He’s gettin’ all
dressed up for supper tonight!</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: He ain’t gettin’ dressed to have supper
with us, Peaches!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Don’t let us make you nervous or
nothin’–we know you gotta job to do.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to
come back on–you just go on and take your time.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They’re the garbage-eaters of the ocean’s
floor. The seagulls clean up the shore. The lobsters clean up the bottom
of the sea.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: They eat everything?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Everything that falls to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: It’s time somebody ate them.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I was lookin’ for Wally’s letter. I was gonna
show it to Homer… They made him a captain already– Captain
Worthington!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Daddy, it’s a letter to me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He mentions Homer, too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Wally said to say, “Hello.”</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Oh! That’s… nice.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wally said the most spectacular hits were in
the oil fields at Yenangyat.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: A movie outside?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Yes. But it’s closed all the time now,
because of the blackout.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: People watched the movies in their cars?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: When they watched at all. Do you like
movies?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yes! I’ve only seen one, though.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You’ve seen only one movie? Which one?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “King Kong”. It’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I haven’t seen “King Kong” since I was a
kid!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: That’s a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer said
you’re not supposed to eat it!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: So he’s an apple expert, is he?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Oh my, yes! This is a far superior taste–and
crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder
of most of the apples in my life weren’t meant for pies!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wilbur, he picked them for us himself…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You don’t find it depressing that Homer Wells
is picking apples?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Or that he can’t be bothered to write us a
proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don’t need!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: He probably doesn’t make much money picking
apples–he must have had to pay to send them, too.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I wouldn’t worry, Edna, that he doesn’t have
money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Wilbur, it’s a gift! How can you be angry with
Homer for sending us a gift?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I’ll show him a gift! I’ll give him a gift he
can use!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: But you looked as if you liked it.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I did like it. All I said was, “It’s not
‘King Kong’.”</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: First she loved him, then she didn’t, then no
one else could have him…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: She did love him! How many women have you
known?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: And what did she die of, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: She was torn apart! She died of a broken
heart.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Oh, sure!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What’s the medical explanation?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Well, she was in a weakened condition… I
don’t know! What about “King Kong”?! Is that medically possible?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: At least King Kong knew what he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: What is you doin’ with that Candy,
Homer?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: He’s makin’ history, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: You ain’t gettin’ in no trouble, I
hope.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No trouble.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: That Candy–she’s the nicest girl I
know!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: She’s about the most beautiful girl I ever
seen–I don’t know if she’s the nicest.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: She’s the nicest and the most beautiful girl
I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: That sounds like you is in trouble
already, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s right–that sounds like trouble to
me.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m not in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Yeah, you is. I know when people is in
trouble, and you is.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: His name is Homer Wells…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: …and his pathetic resume is the best I’ve
seen. Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in
this character.</p>
<p><strong>dr. holtz</strong>: But he looks like an excellent young man,
a first-rate candidate!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary
moron to me, but that’s going to be the problem with any doctor
interested in coming here!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: No! I don’t want to know him! He’s doing
missionary work–in India! I wrote him weeks ago, but he’s either too
holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: I fail to see how someone courageous
enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be
dismissed–that part of the world requires precisely the kind of
dedication that is needed here.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Does it snow in Bombay? One winter here and
we’ll be shipping him south, in a coffin!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: You can’t think that a man who has
served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the
slightest daunted by a little snow– have you no idea how harsh and
primitive and full of disease that part of the world is?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Then I suppose we can look forward to
catching various diseases from him!</p>
<p><strong>dr. holtz</strong>: But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally
qualified…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I’m not talking about his medical
qualifications. It’s the Christian thing that bothers me–I just don’t
see it being of much use around here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: I fail to see how a little
Christianity could hurt anyone here!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an
example of what’s available– I didn’t think you’d be interested.</p>
<p><strong>dr. holtz</strong>: We’re very interested!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: Yes, very!</p>
<p><strong>dr. holtz</strong>: You wouldn’t be opposed to meeting with
him?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to meet him.
What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Dr. Homer Wells.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I just hope he won’t expect us to say Grace
all the time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. goodhall</strong>: It’s a nice name, very New
England.</p>
<p><strong>dr. holtz</strong>: Very Maine, a very local-sounding
name.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Very!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: I just wanted to ask you…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Edna! Come dance with me! Let’s be foolish
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Does he know he’s supposed to be in India?
Does he even want to come back?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: He’s a field hand! What could possibly hold
him there?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Cider don’t have no taste till later in
October–it’s too watery now, when we’re usin’ just them early Macs and
them Gravensteins. You don’t get no good cider till you’re pickin’ them
Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them
Russerts…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What about the worms? Most of these apples
are the drops–off the ground, right? There have to be worms.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Of course there’s worms, Homer! And what
is them worms, really? They just protein, them worms! They is good for
you!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That just ain’t right, Jack–your
cigarette’s gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider!
That ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Them people drinkin’ that cider, they don’t
know there’s a cigarette in there!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: It’s not that hard to find it in there,
Jack–it’ll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin’.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You mean swimmin’. I ain’t goin’ in that vat
to fish out no cigarette!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: What business is you in, Jack? Just tell
me what your business is…</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Just say you’re in the apple business, man.
That’s the only business you wanna be in. Just say it.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: You don’t wanna go in the knife business
with Mistuh Rose–just say you’re in the apple business, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What business are you in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I’m in the knife business, Jack. You don’t
wanna go in the knife business with me.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: You’re lucky he didn’t cut your nipples off,
man.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: The good news, Jack, is you’re half-
undressed for swimmin’…</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Yeah, that cigarette ain’t hard to find when
you’re properly undressed.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Give men that. I know how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I don’t need no “almost” a doctor,
Homer.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: We should drown that damn Jack in the
vat!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Now, now, darlin’… Jack just needs to know
what business he’s in.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy– you
just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off him was his
clothes!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You oughta know you don’t go to jail for
cuttin’ a guy’s clothes. Ain’t that right, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You’re a natural. You were born to drive a
car like this.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You think? Maybe I was. I love this
place!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up
there! Have you seen a lot of movies here?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Yes… and no. When you come here, you don’t
really care about the movie.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You don’t care about the movie?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: What are you so crazy about the movies
for?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It was my favorite night at the
orphanage–movie night. We’d race into the dining hall. Of course
everyone wanted to sit in front, so we’d be packed in so tight you could
feel the kid next to you breathing.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: At least you were never lonely.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I didn’t say that. Growing up in an
orphanage, you’re always lonely. You’re just never alone.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You’re not alone in the bathroom, or… or in
the shower… you’re never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf,
or even in your own bed on a cold morning.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You don’t miss it?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I miss things. I miss… people. I miss reading
to the boys.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: But you had so much responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I never asked for any responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Just a little privacy.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in
movies.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Did you come here with Wally–to not watch
movies?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Sometimes… movies mostly bore Wally.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Ah-ha. So what is that–a radio?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: The speaker. For the movie sound.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Scrunch down like this.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How could you not care about the movie?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You just cuddle. You come to hug… to kiss.
You don’t come here to watch the movie.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That’s what I’d come here for. I’d watch the
movie.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Not with the right girl you wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Fuzzy? Fuzzy?</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: What are you going to tell the little
ones?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I’ll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Why would the little ones believe that
anyone would adopt him?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: They’ll believe it because they want to
believe it.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Shouldn’t we tell Homer?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: If Homer wanted to know what was happening
here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: It was a family with a better breathing
machine then the one Dr. Larch built.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: The family that adopted Fuzzy, they invented
the breathing machine. It’s their business… breathing machines.</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Lucky Fuzzy!</p>
<p><strong>all the boys</strong>: Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy!
Good night, Fuzzy Stone!</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Some mail for you, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: And some clothes for you, dear– let’s go see
if they fit.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Ain’t you gonna see what it is, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Mind your own business, Peaches.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Sorry, Homer…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Aren’t you worried that people will cut their
feet?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Nobody will swim here until next summer. By
then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand–there
won’t be any sharp edges.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: See? That’s last year’s glass, or from some
year before. I put glass here every year. The ocean makes it
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Nobody volunteers for the Burma run–he said
so himself. And nobody knows me better than him! So how am I supposed to
feel? He’s a bomber pilot and I’m just selfish, I know. Well, I’m not a
brave little girl and I’m not sorry.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I know this was right. I told you. I’m not
good at being alone. I told him, too.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I know this was right.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Slow down, Homer–don’t be in such a big
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: This is easy–I’m not hurrying.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You still doin’ it too fast!</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: He’s in a big hurry, all right. I told
you he’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you
want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: It will be okay.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What will be okay?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: We have to wait and see. I think that, for
everything in life, you have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’ll just move on, get another job
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Every time you throw a snail off the dock,
you’re makin’ someone start his whole life over.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Maybe we’re doing the snails a favor,
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s gettin’ late. I think I’ll pack it in.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Good night, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: We’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I used to hate it when Wally went back to
college–even when it was just college! And this was when his father was
still alive… I hated it even then. Naturally I hate this more.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: What I mean is… I would like it very much if
you thought you could be happy here, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Mrs. Worthington, I feel I’m very lucky to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: There’s not a lot of work in the winter, and
you’ll have to tolerate Vernon–even Wally despises him, and Wally likes
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I think Wally will be fine,
Mrs. Worthington–he seems indestructible to me.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: I don’t know. Just promise me one thing.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Uh… sure.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Just promise me that, if there’s a blizzard,
you’ll move into Wally’s room until it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Good-bye. Have a safe trip home. Thank you,
again, for all your hard work.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You take care now, Mrs. Worthin’ton.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Good-bye, Arthur. Homer, I’ll see you
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: We all set, I think.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You all take care of yourself, too,
Homer!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: We see you next harvest.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Don’t freeze to death, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Go on and freeze to death if you want to,
Homer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Now, now, Jack–that just ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: You just stay out of trouble, Homer!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: So, you’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Olive told me. You might have told me
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m just waiting and seeing. Like you
said.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your doctor’s
bag…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: …although it seems that I will not have the
occasion to use it.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Barring some emergency, of course. I am not a
doctor. With all due respect to your profession. I am enjoying my life
here.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’ve looked at so many women… I mean, I’ve
seen everything about them, everything… but I never felt a thing. I felt
nothing. Now… with you… it hurts… to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I am enjoying being a lobsterman and an
orchardman–in fact, I have never enjoyed myself so much.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: The truth is, I want to stay here. I believe
I am being of some use.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: My dear Homer, I thought you were over your
adolescence, that period which I would define as the first time in our
lives when we imagine we have something terrible to hide from those who
love us.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Do you think it’s not obvious to us what’s
happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You’re fallen in love, haven’t you? By the
way, whatever you’re up to can’t be too good for your heart. Then again,
it’s the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it.
So don’t worry about it!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning here may
not be as important as what I learned from you, but everything is new to
me. Yesterday I learned how to poison mice. You use poison oats and
poison corn.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Field mice girdle an apple tree. Pine mice
kill the roots. I know what you have to do–you have to play God. Well…
killing mice is as close as I want to come to playing God.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Do I interfere? When absolutely helpless
women tell me that they simply can’t have an abortion, that they simply
must go through with having another–and yet another– orphan… do I
interfere? Do I? I do not. I do not even recommend. I just give them
what they want: an orphan or an abortion. You are my work of art, Homer.
Everything else has been just a job. I don’t know if you’ve got a work
of art in you, but I know what your job is. You’re a doctor!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I am not a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: You know everything I know, plus what you’ve
taught yourself–you’re a better doctor then I am and you know it!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: They’re going to replace me, Homer! The Board
of Trustees is looking for my replacement!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I can’t replace you! I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: Sorry? I’m not ‘sorry’! Not for anything I’ve
done. I’m not even sorry that I love you!</p>
<p><strong>larch</strong>: I think we may have lot him to the world.
He’s not coming back.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: It’s that Homer!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: It’s that Candy, too…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Don’t this place look like home?</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: It look nicer then home!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: What have you two been doin’ to make it
look so nice?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: How is that Wally doing?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Oh, he’s fine! I just heard from him. He’s
bombing all these places…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: …bridges, oil refineries, fuel depots…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Where’s Jack?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: He just wasn’t up for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That Jack just never knew what his
business was.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You pickin’ nothin’ but cider apples,
Peaches–I hope you understand that.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: They ain’t drops–I picked ’em off the
tree!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Then you pickin’ ’em too fast–they ain’t
no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? Half of these
is bruised! Look at this one! It ain’t got no stem! You might as well
step on ’em, too–they only good for cider.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Do you think I’m having a good time? Do you
think I’m just teasing you? Do you think I know whether I want you or
Wally?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: So we should “wait and see.” For how
long?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life
with him.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Fine. That’s all there is to it then.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No! That’s not all there is to it! I love
you, too–I know I do.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay, okay–I know you do, too.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: It’s a good thing I didn’t have that baby,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Ain’t you eatin’ with us, Rose? She used to
eat with us. Now we ain’t good enough for her, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: She ain’t hungry, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: She ain’t hungry every mornin’ ‘cause she’s
sick every mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You okay, Rose?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I guess you must like watchin’ me be
sick…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t like watching anyone be sick.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How many months are you?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You’re not yet three months, are you?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Not yet. What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know more than I want to know about it.
Who’s the father?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Don’t trouble yourself about it,
Homer–this ain’t your business.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: But you don’t look very happy.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Happy! What are you thinkin’? How am I
supposed to take care of a baby! I can’t have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do,
I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: What I mean is, if you don’t want to… keep
the baby, I know a place where you can go.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: You think Daddy’s gonna let me go
anywhere? I ain’t going nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Why don’t you just go back to your
pickin’, Homer? I can take care of it myself!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Rose, listen–don’t do anything. You know, I
mean to yourself. Please listen…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Homer! Is this a workin’ day or what?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: We should take her to St. Cloud’s. That much
is obvious, isn’t it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I told her! She doesn’t feel she can do that.
Something about her father not letting her go anywhere…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Well, we have to help her!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: We have to do something. Don’t we? Homer?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I’ve got some more clothes for you– I just
keep forgetting to bring them with me.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I don’t need no more clothes, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Rose, I know what’s going on. Homer told me.
I got pregnant, too–about a year ago. I’ve been through this.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: You ain’t been through what I been
through, Candy.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Yes, I have!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Who’s the father, Rose?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You want to have the baby?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I know where you can go. Homer and I can take
you…</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I can’t go nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Is it the father? Does he know?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You can trust me. Is it Jack? It’s not Jack,
is it? It’s Muddy! Is it Muddy?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: No. It ain’t Muddy. Muddy’s just…</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: It sure ain’t Jack.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I’ll be up top…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: She won’t go to St. Cloud’s!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Well, we can’t force her. It’s her
decision.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You don’t understand! It’s her father…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Mr. Rose knows?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He’s the father! He’s her baby’s father!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Wait… wait! Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: We’ve got to keep her away from that
bastard!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I didn’t see where you was pickin’ this
mornin’, Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like
you’re serious about gettin’ to your lunch today!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Are you sleeping with your own daughter?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I think you been stayin’ up too late at
night, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You’re actually having sex with your own
little girl? Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Ain’t nobody havin’ sex with my little
girl, Homer–that’s somethin’ a father knows.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You’re lying. How can you… with your own
daughter!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Homer, don’t you know what business you
in? You don’t wanna go into no business with me, Homer–ain’t that
right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Go on, cut my clothes. I’ve got other
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You a fine one to be talkin’ about lies.
Shame! These people took you in. That boy Wally’s at war!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: But she’s your daughter…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: And I love her! There ain’t nobody else
gonna treat her as good as I do! I wouldn’t do nothin’ to hurt her,
Homer–you must know that.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: She’s pregnant. Do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Don’t mess in this, Homer, if you know what’s
good for you.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: How long’s this been going on, Muddy?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Long enough. You ain’t gonna stop it.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: There’s my knife, Homer. It ain’t gonna do me
no good. You give that knife to Rose Rose, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: You best just watch you ass, Homer! You don’t
wanna end up like Jack!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: When the plane was hit, the crew
chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third.
All on Captain Worthington’s orders– the captain was still flying the
plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky–that’s how thick
the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash–they never heard it
crash. They never saw Captain Worthington’s parachute, either.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Why was he missing for twenty days?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: Because the crew thought he’d gone
down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China
before they were flown back to India. It wasn’t until that they sorted
through their gear…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Who cares about their gear?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: Three men jumped from the plane, but
they had four compasses with them. One of the crew jumped with Captain
Worthington’s compass.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He was in Burma for twenty days without a
compass?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: He followed the Irrawaddy River, all
the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed to avoid the Japs, but not the
mosquitoes.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: Then it’s malaria?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: It’s encephalitis B. He’s recovering
at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon. Uh… Captain Worthington is paralyzed.
Waist down. He won’t walk.</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: There are no autonomic effects, are
there?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: No autonomic effects… that’s
correct.</p>
<p><strong>olive</strong>: When will he be home, Major?</p>
<p><strong>major winslow</strong>: Four weeks or so, right around
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: There are no autonomic effects, just the
paralysis of the lower extremities.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Wally can have kids, a normal sex life…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How about him not needin’ the friggin’ compass!
How about that?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Daddy, please…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good night, kids. Don’t catch cold– it’s
gettin’ cold already.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Good night, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Good night, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Just tell me. I’ll do whatever you want to
do.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Isn’t that like waiting and seeing?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come
home. I’m afraid to see him, too.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know. Is that nothing.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No, don’t–that’s something. Nothing is
nothing. Don’t even look at me. I want…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: …to do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s a tempting idea, I know… to do
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Please don’t move, don’t go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Go anywhere? Of course not! That would be
doing something, wouldn’t it? We wouldn’t want to do something. Let’s
just sit here all night!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: If you’re trying to be funny, Homer…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m not trying to be anything–I’m just doing
nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then–with any luck– I won’t ever
have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Stop it! Just cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You got up! You did something! If you keep
this up, you might be in danger of making a decision!</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: For God’s sake, Homer, Wally’s been shot
down!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I know, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: He’s paralyzed!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: He’s alive. He still loves you. So do I.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Nothing. You’re not the one who has to do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You ain’t goin’ nowhere in the middle of
the night, girl!</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I ain’t your business no more, Daddy.
Please let me go.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You just go inside, Homer. We don’t need
no help.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: That’s right, Homer. This ain’t your
business.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Please listen to me! Both of you…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You forget yourself, Homer. This here’s my
daughter! You got your own mess to deal with–ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: What business is you in, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Mr. Rose, I’m in the doctor business. If you
want, I can help you. You don’t have to go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: What’s that? What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: One cervical stabilizer, two sets of
dilators–Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one
medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: There ain’t no almost about this stuff,
Homer–ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze–lots
of gauze.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: When it comes to this, you is the real
thing–is that what you sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No almost about it–I’m a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Get out of here, please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: I’m stayin’, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Okay. Then you can be of use.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You better get some air.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: The bleeding should taper off tomorrow, but
it can come back again. The cramps will ease up, almost entirely. The
bleeding is usually much lighter in two days. As long as the bleeding
isn’t heavy, it’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: It’s that Vernon–he keeps askin’ where you
and Homer and Rose Rose is at.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Tell that Vernon to mind his own business,
Muddy.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: I told him that you all is sick.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Tell him what you want, Muddy–you is the
crew boss today.</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Look at that. Them same damn rules is
tacked up again!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Why don’t you put them damn rules in the wood
stove, Peaches?</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: I want to hear what they are, first.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: Homer, let me hear what they are.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “One: Please don’t smoke in bed.”</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: We heard that one already, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Two: Please don’t go up to the roof to eat
your lunch.”</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: That’s the best place to eat lunch!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Three: Please–even if you are very hot–do
not go up to the roof to sleep.”</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: What do they think? They must think we’re
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: They think we’re dumb niggers so we need dumb
rules–that’s what they think.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: This is the last one.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Four: There should be no going up on the
roof at night.”</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Why don’t they just say, “Stay off the
roof!”?</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Yeah, they don’t want us up there at all!</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>rose rose</strong>: It means nothin’ at all! And all this
time I been wonderin’ about it!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: They’re outrageous, them rules!</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Who live here in this cider house,
Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the
mess, and who just plain live here… just breathin’ in the vinegar?
Somebody who don’t live here made them rules. Them rules ain’t for us.
We the ones who make up them rules. We makin’ our own rules, every day.
Ain’t that right, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Please don’t make me say it again.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No, that’s not it–I just want to be sure I
understand you.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I helped you not to think about Wally. You
were so upset–you couldn’t stand worrying about him, about his being
killed and not coming back– but when you were with me, you could stop
worrying… well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you,
right?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Please… that’s enough. I loved you, too–you
know I did.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “…did.” Well, okay.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: And now that Wally’s coming back, and because
he’ll certainly need you…</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: You say that as though it’s some awful thing!
I never stopped loving Wally!</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: At least there’s no more waiting and seeing.
At least I got to see the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Rose Rose has runned away!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: She took off in the night!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: She took off on the bicycle, man.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Ain’t nobody gonna find her, Homer– she’s
long gone. I swear, I didn’t try and stop her– I just wanna touch her
hand before she go. That’s all I wanna do, I swear. Where’d she get that
knife, Muddy? That looked like your knife–what I seen of it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna
thank you for givin’ it to her– no girl should be goin’ hitch-hikin’ if
she don’t got a good knife with her.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Where’d she get you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: She just plan misunderstand me–I was
tryin’ to give her my knife, I was just reachin’ to touch her hand. But
I understand if she misunderstand me–it’s all my fault, ain’t that
right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: It’s too late for the doctor now,
Homer–ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: She’s good with that knife! She’s real
fast. She’s a lot better with that knife than you is, Muddy! And who do
you suppose taught her?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: You taught her, I suppose…</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s right! A girl’s gotta know how to
defend herself, don’t she?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: There’s more than one laceration, more than
one cut.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s ‘cause I sticked my own knife in
the wound–after she go, I sticked my own knife in there. I poked it all
around, I just tryin’ to find the same place she got me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: You listen to me: you tell them police how
this happen, you tell it this way, you hear? My daughter, she runned
off–and I so sad about it that I stabbed myself. I so unhappy that she
gone, I killed myself–that what you say, you hear? That the true
story–ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she
runned away that I killed myself– that what happen here, ain’t that
right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Right?</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: That what happen–you lost you only daughter
so’s you killed yourself! That’s what we say, all right.</p>
<p><strong>mr. rose</strong>: That’s right. I know you understand how I
feel, Homer–you is breakin’ them rules, too. Ain’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: Do you think she’ll be all right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: She knows how to take care of herself.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive
asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Sure. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: I know you don’t think much of being needed,
or of me for that matter…</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I’m sorry for what I said about Wally needing
you. It was… unnecessary.</p>
<p><strong>candy</strong>: No, I’m the one who should be sorry. You have
every right to be angry.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: No. You warned me. I didn’t listen, but you
warned me.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You told me you weren’t any good at being
alone. You told Wally, too. Right?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: He’s going to be fine, Wally’s going to be
fine. I know he is.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you about
Wilbur.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I can assure you that the overdose was
entirely accidental.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr. Larch has
found a family.</p>
<p><strong>the boys</strong>: Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night,
Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch!</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: You ever see a palm tree, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: He ain’t never been outta Maine!</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: Ain’t you sick of pine trees, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Let me tell you somethin’ about Florida,
Homer.</p>
<p><strong>hero</strong>: The Sunshine State!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: It’s so nice ‘n’ warm down there, you can
pick them grapefruits and oranges naked, if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Thanks, guys… I’d like to go with you. But
I’ve got to move on.</p>
<p><strong>muddy</strong>: Yeah, well… you could move on with us, man!
You could move on somewhere warm!</p>
<p><strong>peaches</strong>: Homer, stayin’ in Maine ain’t movin’
on!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Dr. Larch often wondered how the world was
treating you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: He talked a lot about you, hoping you would
be of use, whatever you were up to.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “Oh, Lord, support us all the day long…”</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “…until the shadows lengthen and the evening
comes, and the busy world is hushed, and the fever of life is over, and
our work is done.”</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: “Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe lodging,
and a holy rest, and peace at the last.”</p>
<p><strong>the girls</strong>: Amen! Amen! Amen!</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: Did you bring something for me?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You know what? I did.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: It’s from the ocean. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>buster</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mary agnes</strong>: We made up a room for you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wouldn’t you be more comfortable by
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Homer, do you know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Sure. It’s my heart.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Actually, it’s Fuzzy’s. There’s nothing
wrong with your heart.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Fuzzy’s?!</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of the war,
Homer–that’s why he did it. That’s why he told you it was yours.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I think he worried about his own heart. He
said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: “Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and
with everything new about me… I felt… like one in a dream… The
remembrance of that life is fraught with so much… want of hope… Whether
it lasted for a year, or more, or less, I do not know. I only know that
it was, and ceased to be; and… there I leave it.”</p>
<p><strong>curly</strong>: What happens next?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: That’s tomorrow, Curly. Let’s mot give the
story away.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings
of New England!</p>
