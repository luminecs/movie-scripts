<p><strong>ted</strong>: They’re not gonna call… I tell you they’re not
gonna call. I blew it. I don’t know what I did wrong, but I �</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon’s not
about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross
billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.
Now just relax, okay? Everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn’t have
�</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I love you, Billy…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I love you too, mommy… Good-night…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Sleep tight…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t let the bedbugs bite…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Here’s to Ted Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted squeezing him</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All I can say… All I can say is this is maybe
one of the five best days of my whole life…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So anyway Jim and I are making the pitch,
right? And all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and I keep on
going and he keeps on coughing and I keep on going and he keeps on
coughing and �</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Congratulations, Ted. That was a hell of a
job.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where you goin’ Murray, it’s early?</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Got to get home.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, Christ, I’m late… I gotta get out of here.
So anyway, I look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and
I swear to God the only thing I can think about is that this poor
sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: A long and meticulous list that Joanna is
making out of the phone numbers and addresses of doctors and hospitals,
of what the various medicines are for, and of the foods that Billy is
and isn’t permitted to eat.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Hey, what’s the rush? C’mon, walk me a
couple of blocks.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Jim, I’ve got to go. I’m already late �</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Listen, Ted… I just want to tell you, when
old man Schmidt retires next year, I’ve got a pretty good feeling
they’ll kick me upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: …and when they do, I just want you to know
I’m takin’ you along with me.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Y’know, Ted, I mean what I said back
there. You did a hell of a job on this and I want you to know I’m
turning the whole show over to you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: I mean it Ted, you’re running this
one.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I thought you might just like to know that at
five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice
account by Revlon.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, I’m leaving you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That represents a gross billing in excess of
two million � What?!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Here are my keys. I won’t be needing them
any more.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late, all right? I’m sorry I
didn’t call � I was busy making a living.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: My American Express… My Bloomingdale’s
Credit Card… My check book �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, okay… What is it this time? What did I do
now?…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I took two thousand out of the savings
account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Here are the slips for the laundry and the
cleaning. They’ll be ready on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now listen, before you do something you’ll
really regret you’d better stop and think -</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’ve paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone
bill, so you don’t have to worry about them.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: There, that’s everything.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: For God’s sake, Joanna, would you at least tell
me what I did that’s so terrible! Would you do me that little favor?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Look, it’s not your fault, okay? It’s me.
It’s my fault � you just married the wrong person.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So we’ve got problems. Everybody’s got problems
� that’s normal �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, you’re not listening to me. It’s over,
finished.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m listening, Joanna � believe me, I’m
listening. My wife is walking out on me after eight years of �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: You just don’t get it, do you? I � am �
really � and � truly � leaving � you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No you didn’t. You didn’t even ask about
Billy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What about Billy?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’m not taking him with me.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, I can’t… I tried… I really tried but… I
just can’t hack it anymore…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: C’mon, Joanna, you don’t mean that. You’re a
terrific mother �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I am not! I’m a terrible mother! I’m an
awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No…
No. He’s better off without me. Ted, I’ve got to go… I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, I understand and I promise I won’t try
and stop you, but you can’t just go… Look, come inside and talk… Just
for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: NO!… Please… Please don’t make me stay… I
swear… If you do, sooner or later… maybe tomorrow, maybe next week…
maybe a year from now… I’ll go right out the window.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Do you want me to help you get a cab?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna!?… Joanna?!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Huh… Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All right, Thelma… That’s it. I’ve had it. You
can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough,
okay? I mean, I don’t know what I did, but you can tell her she’s made
her point.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Ted, what are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t play innocent with me, Thelma. You know
perfectly well what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Ted, I don’t understand a word you’re
saying. Where’s Joanna?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Ha! You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: All right. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All right, Thelma, you want to know what’s
going on? I’ll tell you what’s going on. I’ll tell you exactly what’s
going on.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Look, Ted, all I �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I came home tonight. We just got the Fire and
Ice account at the agency. Do you know what that means?! Do you
understand what that means? It means that it was maybe one of the five
best days in my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted, all I wanted to know was where �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I walk in the house and before I can say “How
are you?”, “Did you have a nice day?” before I can say anything. Pow
she’s out the door.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: OhmyGod. Didn’t she say anything? She
must’ve said something.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, she said it wasn’t any use talking
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted, don’t be so hostile.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hostile? Me? Thelma, I’m not hostile. I am
anything but hostile. But if you want to know what I am. I’ll tell you
what I am. What I am is, I am hurt. I am very hurt. And I just want to
know one thing, okay? Just one thing… Why? That’s all I want to know…
Why?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and…
well, she told me a lot of… ah, things about the two of you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Things? What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: more than she’s</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Listen, Joanna Kramer’s got a goddamn good
life. She’s got a husband that loves her. She’s got a terrific kid.
She’s got a wonderful home �</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What d’you know about how Joanna felt? You
went off to an office every morning and you’d come dragging home at
seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you
thought everything was swell.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna
Kramer’s not the easiest person in the world to live with?! Did it?! For
one thing she’s always thirty minutes late. You can set your watch by it
�</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: So she’s late. What’s the big deal. That’s
just a way of saying, “Pay attention to me.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Two. She is getting to be a real hermit or
recluse or whatever it is you call it. Thelma, do you know where I could
be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out
socially �</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh for shit’s sake, Ted, you are the most
selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first,
then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the
scraps.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna said that?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Then how come she never said anything like that
to me?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Maybe she didn’t feel like she should have
to. Maybe she felt like if you’d been paying any real attention to her
to start with, maybe you would’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Boy, you guys are really something, y’know? I’d
like to know one thing, okay � just one little thing. Did you tell
Joanna she should leave me?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Y’know something Thelma � you are the typhoid
Mary of divorce. I mean it. Joanna and I never had any trouble until you
and Charley split up.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I
went through it. You’ve got to believe I did everything I could to get
Joanna to stay. But I’ll tell you something. You may not want to hear
it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’d like to know what the hell kind of courage
it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Joanna left Billy? She didn’t take him with
her?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh Shit.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where’s mommy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Huh?… Oh God… What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The little hand is on the six and the big
hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, Christ… Ah, yeah… you want to know why
mom’s not here, right?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, I’m going to tell you… It’s like this.
Mommy and daddy had a little argument and mommy decided she wanted to go
off by herself for a little while. You know how sometimes you get mad
and want to go off and be by yourself? Well, it’s like that, okay? Okay.
Now how about some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When is mommy coming back?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Soon. Very soon.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll tell you what, kiddo � why don’t I fix us
some French toast?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Wow! French toast, really?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure. Didn’t I ever tell you French toast was
my specialty? I’ll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing
we need is… …eggs! Right?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: This is terrific… isn’t this terrific?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m having a good time… Are you having a good
time?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You forgot the milk.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s right. You’re absolutely right… It’s
been a long time since I made French toast.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look at this, isn’t this something?!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What about my orange juice?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Right. One O.J. coming up.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy!!!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t worry… Everything’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Goddam! Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When is mommy coming back?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Soon. I told you before, very soon.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Will she pick me up after school?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. If I’m not here, you go home with Thelma
and Kim.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What if she forgets?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll call Thelma and remind her, okay? Don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But what happens if she’s on her way to
school and she gets runned over by a truck and killed? What happens
them?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Congratulations, Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Terrific news, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Hey… Look who was out celebrating last
night.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, Jim… Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Jesus Christ. That’s a real blockbuster. I
always figured you guys had it made.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You want to know the real kicker? The real
kicker is, for the first time in my life � the first time � I feel like
a loser.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Listen, don’t let it get you down. You’re
going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Me? I’ve never been better. I mean having my
wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Look, Ted, I’m the oldest whore on the
beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces… You’re gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m going to be okay. The way I see it,
Joanna’ll come home, it’s just a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: She’ll be back…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: But… just in case… I mean, just on the off
chance she doesn’t. What are you going to do about the kid?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know, Jim. This whole thing has
happened so… Pow � like that.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: say something very</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted, this may sound a little rough, but
we’ve just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency,
right? And now it’s up to us � that’s you and me � to deliver the goods.
Ted, you’re my main man, and if I can’t depend on you a hundred and ten
percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you’re worried about a kid
with a runny nose �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Jim, I appreciate what you’re saying. I mean
it, but I really think Joanna’s coming back.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: I hope you’re right, Ted… I really hope
you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uh, huh…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You got a letter from mom.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When is she coming home?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: “My dear, sweet Billy: Mommy has gone away.
Sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little
boys. But sometimes a mommy can go away too, and you have your daddy to
bring you up.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: “I have gone away because I must find some
interesting things to do for myself in the world. Everybody has to, and
so do I. Being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things and
this is what I have to do. I did not get a chance to tell you this, and
that is why I am writing you now.”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: “I will always be your mommy and I will always
love you. I just won’t be your mommy in the house. But I will be your
mommy of the heart. And</p>
<p><strong>i… “</strong>: to tell the child to</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: turns down the sound</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh, God… OhmyGod…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know, Thel… This whole thing has
happened so… Pow, like that.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I mean, what are you going to do about
Billy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m gonna keep him, why?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Look, this is nothing personal, but I don’t
think you can do it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thelma, I’ve lost my wife, I’m not losing my
child.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: All right… Okay… But let’s get something
straight, right now. I mean, I’m sorry about what happened between you
and Joanna, but it’s not my problem, understand?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m not going to have you calling every
fifteen minutes just because you can’t find a hot water bottle,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’ve got enough trouble raising my own kid.
I don’t need another one. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re on your own, understand?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: All right. Who’s Billy’s pediatrician?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ed Davies. 230 East 76th Street. 472- 8227.
Fifty bucks a house call, thirty for an office visit. Write this down:
I’m not telling you twice. What’s the nearest hospital?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and
Lex. The emergency number is 327- 0800.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Slow down… Slow down…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Colors in one pile, white things in another
and shirts in a third.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Brush the teeth. Hang up the towel and flush
the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: ’Night, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Hey, Ted. C’mon in. I wanna’ talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: What’s the big rush. C’mon in, put your
feet up, have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Can’t do it tonight. Gotta pick up Billy. I’m
late.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Listen, I heard a terrific joke today.
There’s this Polish skydiver �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sorry, Jim I’ve got to go. I’ll talk to you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Murray? Jim O’Connor, why don’t you drop
by and have a drink…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mrs. Kline, I’m sorry I’m late, but �</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kline</strong>: That’s all right, but I’m afraid Billy
was a little nervous…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and �</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kline</strong>: Goodbye, Bill. Thank you for coming.
Mark. Say goodbye to Bill.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I was waiting a long time.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: the greeting he’s</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: All the other mothers got here a long time
ago…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay… Same as usual…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy, don’t eat with your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom, I mean dad?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Can I be excused? I’m not hungry. I think
I’ll go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure. Too much birthday cake, right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: ’Night.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Listen, pal, I’m sorry, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, I remember one time when. I was a couple
of years younger than you are now and… I was staying with this cousin of
mine and my parents were supposed to come and pick me up by three, but
it got later and later and they didn’t and they didn’t show up and I
remember I got really scared that something had happened to them and I
remember when they finally came instead of being happy to see them I was
very angry and… Billy, I promise I’ll never do that to you again,
okay?…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s very big… They didn’t tell me it was
this big.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No… No, actually it’s only two bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>second woman</strong>: Phew… This place is a real pig
sty.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, my wife just walked out on me. Okay? It’s
been a tough week.</p>
<p><strong>third woman</strong>: Don’t tell me your troubles, mister. I
got enough of my own.</p>
<p><strong>fourth woman</strong>: The first thing is, I don’t do
floors.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted.</p>
<p><strong>fourth woman</strong>: Or windows. I come in at ten and I get
Wednesdays off.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll be with you in a minute, Jim. You couldn’t
make that Saturday, could you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. willewska</strong>: What kind of boy is your son?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, he’s… ah, he’s a good kid. He’s shy and…
I think he’s probably very creative and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. willewska</strong>: Could I see him?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure. He’s right in here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. willewska</strong>: Oh… He’s very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. willewska</strong>: Mr. Kramer, you are a very lucky
man.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mrs. Willewska, could you start on Monday?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom, I mean dad…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s not the right soap. We use the kind in
the green and yellow box.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: C’mon, there’s not much difference �</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We use the green and yellow.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The pink stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, what color cereal do we get?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain and
buy him an ice.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: direction of the</p>
<p><strong>saturday father</strong>: Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain,
buy him an ice. It’ll kill twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ve got a lot more than twenty minutes to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>saturday father</strong>: Tough… …I get off duty at
five-thirty. How long you been divorced?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Three months. How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>saturday father</strong>: You’ve got that look. My lady and I
split two years ago in August and I’m an old pro at this shit. First
thing, stay away from the Children’s Zoo. It’s pure hell � if I never
see another chicken, I’ll be happy. I’m here, darling. Don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mommy! Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh. I thought you were my mommy.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Welcome to the greatest show on earth.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Welcome to the…</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Greatest.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Greatest…</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Show.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Show…</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: On earth.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: On earth.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Mr. Kramer, I just wanted to tell you what
a wonderful boy your son is.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know… I’ve been worried… I mean, with
what he’s been through and everything. I �</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: No… No… Billy is doing just fine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, you know it’s not easy raising a kid on
your own and I thought if we could get together and, uh, discuss �</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Barbara! Congratulations! When is the baby
due?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Oh, God. Not ’til August.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Excuse me. You said you wanted to talk,
Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes, but… ah, not now… I’ve got an appointment…
I forgot all about it…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. O’Connor called. There’s a meeting
with the Revlon people in the board room and you’re fifteen minutes
late.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I know… I know.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Schmidt can’t have the figures on the
television buy until Monday.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. Uh, uh. Tell him I asked for it Friday. I
want it Friday. Period.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet
on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: And Mrs. Kelsey called to ask if Billy
can come to Stephanie’s birthday party on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes. Remind me to pick up a “Crying Chrissie”
doll at lunch on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: If it’s all right with you, Mother Kramer,
can we get down to work now?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Hello, Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hiya, Phyllis. These are the Revlon contracts.
I thought you ought to check them out.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes, what?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Yes, I’ll have dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Kramer, I’ve got to go. I’ve got an eight
o’clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mmmmnph… I’ll get you a cab…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: hall on the way to</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do you like fried chicken?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Ah… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So do I…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I just met your son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Like that?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: He wanted to know if I liked fried
chicken.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So what’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You ever think about getting married again?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No, not really… I guess it’s different if
you don’t have children, but… I dunno, even if Charley and I don’t live
together, even if we’re sleeping with other people, even if Charley was
to marry again… He’d still be my husband. That stuff about “Till death
do you part?” That’s really true.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: cookbook that is</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Three. And add some basil.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: D’you think you and Charley’ll ever get back
together again?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: C’mon, Thel. So Charley had a little fling. So
what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Look, I know this isn’t gonna make any
sense, okay? I mean forget the logic part… But I keep thinking if
Charley really loved me, he wouldn’t have let me divorce him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now look, you hold it like this… …and you swing
like this…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: No, no, no, Kramer. That’s not how you do
it. Look…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: …you hold it like this… Farther down the
bat. And you swing like this… Throw me one.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, Jim. Here’s the report on…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Murray had some ideas about the Fire and
Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs… I think
they’re kind of interesting.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t. Jim, this isn’t anything like what we
talked about. It’s not even close.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Ted, basically it’s still your concept.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Murray just added a few things, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now hold it right there, I’m the one that went
in and sold Revlon on this idea to start with, remember? You said I was
going to be �</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, Billy, I told you before, one hour of
T.V. a day, that’s the rule… No… I don’t care what the other mothers do…
Listen, I can’t talk now, I’m in a meeting… Billy, I’ll talk to you
later, good- bye.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Ted, I appreciate what you’re saying, but I
really think you’re just too close to it right now.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Murray’s right. Look it’s just some ideas,
okay? I mean nothing’s locked in cement. I promise you this is your
show…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Trust me on this one, Ted…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom, I mean dad…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: In a minute…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you do when an elephant sits on your
fence?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You get a new fence.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: C’mon, Billy. I’m trying to work for God’s
sake…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Goddamnit, can’t you watch what you’re
doing!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of shit at the
office because I’m not pulling my weight because I’m busting my butt
trying to be a decent goddamn father and �</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s terrific. That’s really terrific, but I
notice I’m the one that’s cleaning up this � Oh, crap, I’ll have to do
this one over.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, it’s after your bedtime, okay? Just do me
a favor and go to bed, okay?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, I’m sorry I yelled, okay?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s just… I’ve been catching a lot of flack at
the office…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: How about lunch, Kramer. I’m buying.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Perrier and lime… …and scotch with soda.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, Phyllis, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Kramer…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: O’Connor’s out to get you. He’s going to
take the Fire and Ice account away from you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t believe it! That’s crazy! Why would Jim
do something like that?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: You want to know why? I’ll tell you why…
Another scotch and soda for the gentleman. I’ll tell you exactly why.
Because you’re not his buddy anymore. Because he can’t count on you to
sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit
with him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I can’t. I’ve got Billy to take care of.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: You dope. O’Connor doesn’t give a damn
about Billy. All he wants is somebody that’ll hang around with him every
night so he won’t have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: All right. Okay. But tell me something,
Kramer. Who do you think is palling around with O’Connor these days?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Murray.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So… what’s so terrible about that?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: him by the shoulders and shake him
until</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. No, I don’t believe it. Jim O’Connor would
never let anything like that happen. He gave me my shot in this
business. If it wasn’t for Jim O’Connor I’d be � I don’t know where I’d
be. He’s a wonderful man…</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Kramer, I’m sorry. All I was trying to do
was �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t want to hear another word against him.
Not another word. He’s a wonderful man… a wonderful man…</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The finished proof of the ad that Murray had
done, that Ted had seen in O’Connor’s office.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. O’Connor is in
conference.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All right, Jim. You said I was running this
show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right? Well what
the hell is this? What’s going on, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Well, ah… I thought it over and I decided
we’re doing it Murray’s way.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Jim, this is garbage. This isn’t anything like
what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can’t �</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: That’s my decision, Ted and that’s
final.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Salisbury steak.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I hate it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You don’t hate it. We had Salisbury steak last
week and you liked it fine.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No I didn’t. I hate the brown stuff. It’s
gross.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All it is is onions and gravy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m allergic to onions.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You are not allergic of onions. You’ve had them
lots of times.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I want a pizza.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No. This is fine. Just take a bite, you’ll like
it fine.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I think I’m going to throw up.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, for God’s sake… Here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: There, okay? Now that’s just plain old
hamburger.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Some of the brown stuff is still there.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Then eat around it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I
had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t care. I hate it. I want pizza.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Not on your life. That’s it. I’ve had it with
crap around this house. From now on, no more pizza! Get it? Starting
right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You want to know something?! You are a spoiled
selfish little brat! Now eat �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Goddamnit! Go to your room!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Owwww… You’re hurting me… You’re hurting me…
I hate you… I hate you…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re no bargain either, pal.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I want my mommy… I want my mommy..</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I want my… mm… ommy… I want mmmy… mommy…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Tough shit. You’re stuck with me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I want my… mmmo… mmmy. I want mmmy mmo…
mmy…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s okay, pal. Go back to sleep. It’s very
late.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you… gonna go… away?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Of course I’m not going away. I love you very
much. I’ll be right here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s why mommy left… isn’t it? ’Cause I was
bad…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy and holds him</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is mom ever coming back?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You mean for good?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now go to sleep. It’s very late.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sleep tight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t let the bedbugs bite.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: See you in the morning light.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Not for a couple of months. The last time I
heard from her she was living in San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: California?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Uh, huh… She said she had a good job, was
playing a lot of tennis. She wanted to know all about Billy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: She ever ask about me?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Uh, huh… Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What d’you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I told her you’re doing a pretty good
job.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer’s
Fantastic Superjet!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: That’s good, Billy… That’s a brave boy… Now
then, how’s that? Now we’ve cleaned it out…</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Now then, you just wait here, Billy. I want
to talk to your dad for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer. One
inch over and it would have caught the eye.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: But I’m going to have to take some
stitches.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Because of the position of the wound and
your son’s age, I don’t think there will be much of a scar. Otherwise
I’d call in a plastic surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Now, I’d advise you to wait outside. It’ll
be eas �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Mr. Kramer, there’s �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fuck you. He’s my son. I’m staying with
him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Ohhh… Ohhhh… Ohhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: It’s okay, son… I’m here… Just a little more to
go… Don’t worry, son… I’m here…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He’s okay… Thel, can I ask you a favor?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t mean a little favor. I mean a big F
favor.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thelma, if I die �</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I didn’t say I’m going to die, but if I should
�</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Don’t say that! I don’t want to hear you say
that!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thel, listen to me. If, on the million to one
shot that I should � That anything should happen to me. Would you take
care of Billy?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Me?! You want me to take care of Billy?!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I thought about it a lot and you’re the only
person I know that I trust with him. I mean, if anything happened to me,
he’d be okay with you. You’re a good mother.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I know it’s not an easy thing to answer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, if it’s too much responsibility �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thank you, Thel. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>ted’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>joanna’s voice</strong>: Ted?</p>
<p><strong>ted’s voice</strong>: Joanna?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’hotel</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven’t
seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer, she waits for you in the
back.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thank you, John.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hello, Ted. You look well.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: The usual, Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Thanks, Gino.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: How’s the new job?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look at us, Joanna. Just like any old married
couple having dinner. Who would believe it.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes… How’s Billy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He’s great… except… …Except he had… he fell and
he cut his face. He… He has a scar, Joanna, from about here to here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I can’t help but feel somehow… it’s my fault. I
keep thinking I could’ve done something � stopped it…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: You can’t tell it from a distance, Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee
shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: He looks like a terrific kid.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He is… You sat in that coffee shop across from
school �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Watching my son… Ted, I’ve been living in
New York for the past two months.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’ve been living here, in the city?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted… The reason I wanted to see you… I want
Billy back.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You want what?!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I want my son. I’m through sitting in coffee
shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Are you out of your mind?! You’re the one that
walked out on him, remember?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, listen to me… You and I, we had a
really crappy marriage � Look, don’t get so defensive, okay? It was
probably as much my fault as it was yours… Anyway when I left I was
really screwed up �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna, I don’t give a �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, all my life I’d either been somebody’s
daughter or somebody’s wife, or somebody else’s mother. Then all of a
sudden, I was a thirty- two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just
walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that
was about as far away as I could get. Only… I guess it wasn’t far
enough. So I started going to a shrink. Ted, I’ve had time to think.
I’ve been through some changes. I’ve learned a lot about myself.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Come on, Joanna, what did you learn? I’d really
like to know.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: One thing, okay? Just tell me one goddam thing
you’ve learned.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’ve learned that I want my son.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna, go be a mother. Get married, have kids.
Don’t get married, have kids. Do whatever you want. I don’t give a damn.
Just leave me out of it � and leave my baby out of it.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, if you can’t discuss this rationally
-</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna, go fuck yourself!</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, she walked out on her own child, right?
That’s desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I’m telling you it’s an open and
shut case.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: First, there’s no such thing as an open
and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Second, the burden is on us to prove your
ex-wife is an unfit mother. That means I’m going to have to play rough
and, if I play rough, you can bet they will too. Can you take that,
Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Third, it’ll cost you five thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: That’s if we win. If we lose, you could
end up having to pay your wife’s court costs as well.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Good. You’ve hired yourself a hell of a
lawyer, Mr. Kramer. How old is the child?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: That’s tough. In most cases involving a
child that young, the court tends to side with the mother.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But she signed over custody. Here…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: I’m not saying we don’t have a shot, but
it won’t be easy… Mr. Kramer, do me a favor. There is something I find
very helpful in matters like this. I sit down and make a list of all the
pros and cons on an issue. I actually write them down and look at them.
I want you to do that, okay? Then, after that, if you’re really sure you
want to retain custody of your child � then we’ll go in there and whip
their asses.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I love you Billy Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I love you too daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs bite…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: See you in the morning light…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Look, ah… Ted. I just got word from the
guys at Revlon and… ah they did some marketing tests on our campaign and
the results were…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Disappointing. It only pulled a fourteen
share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum, and… ah… they’re
not very happy and… Well, the guys have decided they want to… ah,
re-think the entire concept and… Look, I don’t like having to do this,
okay?… But… I mean, what I mean is… ah, I’m going to have to… ah, let
you go �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Are you firing me, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: C’mon, Ted, don’t get emotional. Okay?
Look, this isn’t exactly an easy thing for me to do, y’know? I swear
Murray and I did everything we could, but those sons of bitches were out
for blood. I mean it was all I could do to keep the account inside the
shop… Look, I promise, if I hear of anything I’ll let you know first
thing.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted?…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor’s voice</strong>: Ted?…</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Ummm, hmmm… umm, hmmm… Well, this looks
very good.. Of course …you understand this is the worst time of the year
to look for a job.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?! What do you mean, I don’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about
leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, you don’t understand. I need a job. I’ve
got a kid and �</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: I understand and I’m absolutely sure
something wonderful will turn up… …after the first of the year.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, huh?</p>
<p><strong>secretary’s voice</strong>: Mr. Kramer? Please hold for
Mr. Shaunessy…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Ted? They’ve set the court date.
I just heard today… It’s… January sixth.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, Christ.. .John, there’s some- thing I ought
to tell you. My… ah, situation has… changed. I lost my job.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Ted, I won’t lie to you, we don’t
have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you’re out of
work.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of
my life.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Ted? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Any prospects?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t worry. I plan to have something within
twenty-four hours, John.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: How the hell are you going to do
that?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Mis-ter Kramer, as I mentioned
yesterday, this is a very bad time of year to look for work. Now I’m
sure we’ll have something for you by mid-February, March at the
latest.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I need a job, now.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: No… No… No…</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: There might be something at J. Walter
Thompson. But… …I don’t think they’re really serious. The position’s
been open for two months and… They may just be on a fishing expedition.
I’m sure you’ll be much happier if you wait until after the first �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson. Set
up an appointment at four.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: almost to the breaking</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Either you call and set up the appointment, or
I’ll call. And if I call, you lose the commission.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: My, we are a hot shot aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You bet your ass.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So, Mr. Ackerman, as you can see from my
resume, my experience in setting up the leisure package concept means
that I’ve spent a lot of time working along the same lines as your
multiple buys and your regional advertising ideas. I know the pitfalls,
but � and this is more important � I know the potential revenue for the
company inherent in these programs.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Well, Mr. Kramer, I must say this has been
very impressive. I’d like to think about it and get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Mr. Ackerman, is there anyone else that I
should see before you come to a decision.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Mr. Spencer, our Advertising Director.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Could I see him right away?</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: I’m sorry, but he’s leaving this evening
for a two-week vacation. I’ll set up something the moment he gets
back.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’d like to see him now � before he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Mr. Kramer, I don’t think �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I want this position very much.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: So you’re the go-getter. All right, you’ve
got ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: That’s very interesting, Mr. Kramer. I must
say, it’s very interesting. Let me think about it. I’ll let Jack… …know
and he’ll get in touch with you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Excuse me, I believe you said I had ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That means I’ve got two minutes left. I
understand you’re paying twenty- five.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: All right, I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do �
I’ll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that’s twenty-five hundred
less than you’re offering. The only thing is, you have to say yes right
now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not after the holidays. It’s worth it
to me for a yes right now and I’ll take twenty-five hundred less.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Today only. One day only. Twenty-two five.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>ackerman</strong>: Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Welcome aboard, Mr. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, gentlemen, I’m pleased to be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re a terrific kid, Billy Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>ted’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Ted? John Shaunessy here. I just
got a call from your wife’s lawyer. She wants to see the kid.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?! She wants what?!</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: She’s the mother. That means
she’s within her legal rights.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: John, what if she kidnaps him. I’ve heard all
these �</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Look, Ted, I don’t honestly think she
would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was
planning on kidnapping him.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know, John… I mean, to be brutally
honest, I’m not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna’s in right now.
Y’know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: You ever see her talk to the
walls?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, but �</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy’s voice</strong>: Then you don’t have a choice.
Have Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street entrance to Central Park,
Saturday at ten.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh, Billy… Oh my Billy… Oh my son…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’ll have him back at six.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna
left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But it doesn’t work that way. A major decision
was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969 � in the case of Haskins
vs. Haskins.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Kramer �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in
favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the
child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: Kramer… There’s something I ought to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I’ve been offered a job in Washington with
H.E.W.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I’m going to take it.</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: It’s a very good job � too good to pass up.
I’ll be handling funding for the whole… Look, I… …“like” you a lot. And
you… …“like” me, okay? Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things
would be different…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: But it’s not a year from now, is it?</p>
<p><strong>phyllis</strong>: I’ll miss you, Kramer…</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: I’m Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to
look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, yes. Won’t you come in.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Where is the child?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: He’s in his room, playing.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Good. I’ll see him in there.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here
with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life
discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Does that distress you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: What does?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: The prospect of losing my child.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Very well, I’d like to see him if I
may.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to
talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. alvarez</strong>: I’d like to talk to Billy
privately.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: What do you have here, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Have you ever been to Detroit?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. But I’ve been to Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: I see you have people there. What are their
names?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s Kim… and this one’s Thelma and that’s
Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that’s Batman and over there is
Robin.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: What about your mommy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, sure. Here, this can be mommy.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Do you like to be with your mommy?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Objection. You’re leading the witness.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: What do you like best about her?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Lunch in a restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: What do you like best about your daddy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Playing.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sure. Lots of times.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: When does he hit you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I
steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.</p>
<p><strong>alvarez</strong>: In real life when does he hit you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My daddy doesn’t hit me, silly. Why would my
daddy hit me?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: who is still in the</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s my name too.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: tracks at the sight</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Wow! Is this really where you work?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is this really your desk?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is that really your chair?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Wow! That’s neat. Can I sit in it?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Did mommy ever see this?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, she never did.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you going to get remarried?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I don’t know. I hadn’t thought much about
it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you going to remarried Phyllis?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Will you and mommy get remarried?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, son. Daddy and mommy will never get
remarried.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she’d
remarried you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Oyez, oyez… The third Circuit Court of the
State of New York, Judge Atkins presiding is now in session. All
rise…</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Your honor. As our first witness I would
like to call Joanna Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Real direct. Motherhood… They’re going
right for the throat.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the
court how long you were married?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Six years.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And would you describe those years as
happy?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: The first couple, yes, but after that it
became increasingly difficult.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job
while you were married to your ex-husband?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No, I did not.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Did you wish to?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes. I tried to talk to Ted � my ex- husband
� about it, but he wouldn’t listen. He refuses to discuss it in any
serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn’t get a job
that would pay enough to hire a baby-sitter for Billy.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at
the present time?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear
designer.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And what is your present salary?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I make thirty-one thousand dollars a
year.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And yet you chose to leave him?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes… Look, during the last five years we
were married, I had… I was getting more and more… unhappy, more and more
frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was
me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted � my
ex-husband, he couldn’t handle it. He became very… I don’t know, very
threatened. I mean, whenever I would bring up anything he would act like
it was some kind of personal attack. Anyway, we became more and more
separate… more and more isolated from one another. Finally, I had no
other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex- husband’s attitude �
his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no
self-esteem… At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was
something wrong with me � that my son would be better off without me. It
was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to
realize I wasn’t a terrible person. And that just because I needed some
creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn’t make me
unfit to be a mother.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Your honor, I would like to place in
evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer’s therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore
Freedman of La Jolla, California.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in
New York?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Because my son is here. And his father is
here. As a mother, I don’t want my child to be separated from his
father.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you
are asking for custody?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Because he’s my child… Because I love him. I
know I left my son, I know that’s a terrible thing to do. Believe me, I
have to live with that every day of my life. But just because I’m a
woman, don’t I have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man? Don’t
I have a right to a life of my own? Is that so awful? Is my pain any
less just because I’m a woman? Are my feelings any cheaper? I left my
child � I know there is no excuse for that. But since then, I have
gotten help. I have worked hard to become a whole human being. I don’t
think I should be punished for that. I don’t think my son should be
punished for that. Billy’s only six. He needs me. I’m not saying he
doesn’t need his father, but he needs me more. I’m his mother.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Kramer. I have no further
questions.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were
married seven years. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or abuse you physically in any way.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Did your husband strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Would you describe your husband as an
alcoholic?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: A heavy drinker?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Was he unfaithful?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Did he ever fail to provide for you?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Well, I can certainly understand why you
left him.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: How long do you plan to live in New York,
Mrs. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Permanently.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Permanently? Mrs. Kramer, how many boy
friends have you had � permanently?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I don’t recall.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: How many lovers have you had �
permanently?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I don’t recall.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: More than three, less than thirty- three
� permanently?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled. The witness will answer,
please.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Somewhere in between.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Do you have a lover now?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Your honor, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question. Does she have a lover?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’ll allow that. The witness will answer
please.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Is that… permanent?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Then, we don’t really know, do we, when
you say “permanently” if you’re planning to remain in New York, or even
to keep the child for that matter, since you’ve never really done
anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be
regarded as permanent.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection! I must ask that the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider
yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every
relationship you have undertaken as an adult?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: I’ll ask it another way. What was the
longest personal relationship you have had in your life � other than
parents and girlfriends?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ah… I guess I’d have to say… with my
child.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Whom you’ve seen twice in a year?
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn’t he the longest personal
relationship in your life?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I suppose…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I
couldn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: How long was that?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: We were married two years before the baby.
And then four very difficult years.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: So, you were a failure at the longest,
most important relationship in your life.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Overruled.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I was not a failure.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Oh? What do you call it then � a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I consider it less my failure than his.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have
just rewritten matrimonial law. You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Your honor, I’d like to ask what this
model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?
Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal
relationship in your life?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Please answer the question, Mrs. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: It did not succeed.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Not it… Not it, Mrs. Kramer � you. Were
you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your
life?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Were you?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on
her?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Do you want the kid or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Now then, Mr. O’Connor, how long did Ted
Kramer work for you?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Eight, almost nine years.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And did you have a close personal
relationship?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And how did you find his work?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot
of drive, a real hustler.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: And yet you fired him.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Ted was a good worker. But, ah… after his
wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things
started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that. I’ve
got problems, everybody’s got problems. But I’ve got a shop to run, I
can’t let that kind of thing get in the way… I guess I felt that Ted was
letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the
office.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Thank you. I have no further questions.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Mr. O’Connor, does the agency still have
the Fire and Ice account?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Mr. O’Connor, can you tell me where you
are employed at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: At the moment I am unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: If the petitioner has no further witnesses,
we will hear the respondent tomorrow morning at 9:30.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom � I mean, dad?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, huh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What did you do when you were little?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I guess about the same kind of things you
do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Did you watch “I Dream of Jeannie?”</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, uh… We didn’t have television then.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You didn’t have T.V.?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Nope. It hadn’t been invented yet.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Was there apple juice when you were
little?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, there was apple juice.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Was there Burger King?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, uh. There was no such a thing as Burger
King.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What else wasn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well, let’s see… There wasn’t McDonald’s. And
there wasn’t astronauts… And there wasn’t frozen yogurt. And there
wasn’t…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known
Ted Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved
into the building.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his
son?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Charley, my husband, and I are… divorced and
Kim, that’s our daughter is about Billy’s age and the children play
together a lot. So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Can you describe the relationship between
Mr. Kramer and his son?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: It’s beautiful. It’s just beautiful. They
have a beautiful relationship.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Objection, your honor. The answer is, to be
generous, very vague.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Can you recall any particular incident
that relates to Mr. Kramer’s care of his child?</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: battle with her</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: No further questions. Thank you
Mrs. Phillips.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: No questions.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court
exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: When Joanna � � my ex-wife � when she was
talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage… Well, I
guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of
things I didn’t understand � a lot of things I would do different if I
could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she
could change… But we can’t. Some things, once they are done, can’t be
undone. Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe she does. So do I. But
the way it was explained to me, that’s not the issue. The only thing
that’s supposed to matter here is what’s best for Billy… When Joanna
said why shouldn’t a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose
she’s right. But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a
better parent simply by virtue of her sex? I guess I’ve had to think a
lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy,
patience, understanding… love. Where is it written that a man has any
less of those qualities than a woman? Billy has a home with me, I’ve
tried to make it the best I could. It’s not perfect. I’m not a perfect
parent. I don’t have enough patience. Sometimes I forget he’s just a
little kid… But I love him… More than anything in this world I love
him.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further
questions.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mr. Kramer, by any chance have you ever had
a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next room?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mr. Kramer, isn’t it true that you were
fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Technically, the agency lost a big account and
seventy four people were let go. I was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: You were fired, correct?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes, but I’m with J. Walter Thompson now. I
don’t think that will happen again.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Give them time…</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Objection, your honor! Counsel is
harassing the witness.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Your honor, I’m only examining the man’s
employment record. He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mr. Kramer, did your child nearly lose an
eye when he was in your care?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Mr. Kramer, did you, or did you not tell
the child’s mother that you were responsible for the injury that
permanently disfigured your child?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Objection! Your honor, counsel is raising
a question that is not germane to these proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: While the child was in the care of the
witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Are you introducing the question of
negligence here, counselor?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Yes, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I see. Well, you’ll have to do better than
that. Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: I do not, your honor, however �</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: This is an isolated incident, counselor,
unless you can prove otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Does the witness deny the injury took
place?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: No, counselor, I’m going to over- rule you on
this line of questioning.</p>
<p><strong>gressen</strong>: Then I have concluded my questions.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’m sorry… I just mentioned it in passing. I
never thought he’d use it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yeah, well he did, didn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Please, Ted. I never would have brought it
up if I thought �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’m not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: You heard anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Any day.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Uh, huh…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ah, Charley and I are… Well, we’re thinking
about… I mean, actually we’re sort of talking about maybe getting back
together.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You and Charley?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey, that’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Maybe. I said maybe. What I mean is, ah… I
don’t think it’ll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Oh, God… Ted, I am really scared.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: C’mon. Billy, Kim. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, Christ!</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: The judge went for motherhood straight
down the line.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I lost him? I lost him?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: I can’t tell you how sorry I am.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, no..</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the
23rd of January. That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support
of said child, four hundred dollars each month. That the father shall
have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night
each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child’s
vacation period. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What if I fight it?</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: We can appeal, but I can’t guarantee
anything.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: It’s going to cost.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll get the money.</p>
<p><strong>shaunessy</strong>: I’ve got to tell you something, Ted. This
time it’ll be Billy that pays. This time I’ll have to put him on the
stand.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, Christ no… I can’t do that. I just… can’t…
Excuse me… I’m sorry… I just…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted!… It’s me… Ted?…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Please go away, Thel… I… I just have to be by
myself for a little while…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: Ted, I just heard…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Please, Thel…</p>
<p><strong>thelma</strong>: I’m so… sorry… Oh, Ted, I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy! You’re home early. Did you get fired
again?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No, son, I didn’t get fired. I’ll tell you what
we’ll do, okay? How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a
little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just
you and me… How ’bout that?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna… This is by way of introducing William
Kramer. He is a sweet child, as you will see. He is allergic to grape
juice, but will more than make up for the loss in apple juice. He is
also allergic to peanut butter from the health food store, but not from
the supermarket. Don’t ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: At times, in the night he will have nightmares,
one particular monster is called The Face. The Face, as best as I can
determine, looks like a circus clown without a body, and from what the
pediatrician says, and what I have read, may be sexual fear of losing
his penis, or a fear of his own anger, or just a circus clown he saw
once.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: His doctor, by the way, is still Ed Davies. The
Sundafed is for colds, one tablespoon every four hours. I will pack it
in the blue suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: His best stories have been Babar and Winnie the
Pooh up to now, with Batman moving up. His housekeeper has been Etta
Willewska and she is the main reason for the note. She is a loving
woman, conscientious, very concerned about Billy and more important,
Billy cares about her.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I urge you to retain her. Her number is
722-8099, and I think she will take the job if it is offered. I’m sure
other things will come up. Ask me what you need to and I guess
eventually we’ll talk…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: That’s all I can think of, except to repeat
what I said before, he’s a terrific kid. I’m grateful for the time we’ve
had together and I feel I am a better man because of my son… Ted.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are
divorced, there’s a discussion about who the child should live with, the
mother or the father. Now there is a man who is very wise. He’s called a
judge. And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides
who it would be best for the child to live with.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why does he decide?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Because… Well, that’s what he does. He’s a very
powerful man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Like a principal?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Bigger than a principal. The judge sits in
robes in a big chair… The judge has thought a lot about us, about you
and me and your mom, and he has decided… …he has decided that it would
be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment. And I’m
very lucky. Because even though you’ll live with your mom Joanna I’ll
get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a
month.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t understand, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What don’t you understand, pal?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: At your mom’s. She’ll have a bed for you in
your own room.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where will my toys be?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll send your toys there and I’m sure you’ll
get some new ones.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who will read me my stories?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Your mom.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Daddy, what if The Face comes when I’m at
mommy’s?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don’t
worry, she’ll tell The Face to beat it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Will you come and say good-night to me every
night?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Look, it’s getting cold. Why don’t you go
inside where it’s warm. I’ll be along in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Go on, scoot.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Hey? What’s doin’ with that bread? Let’s see a
little hustle around here.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: This is it, pal.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>joanna’s voice</strong>: Ted, it’s Joanna. Can you meet me in
the lobby?… Alone?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Okay, I’m here. Now why did you �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, do you love him?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Goddamnit, Joanna. What the �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, do you love him?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I love him too… I don’t think I ever knew
how much until now.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ted, when we got married it was because I
was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and… when
I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby… and I guess
all I did was mess up my life and your life and �</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Joanna, what the hell is �</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Please… Please don’t stop me. This is the
hardest thing I’ve ever had to do..</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: After I left… when I was in California, I
began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my
own child. It got to where I couldn’t tell anybody about Billy � I
couldn’t stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn’t living
with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to
come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I
loved him… And I did… And I won. Only… it was just another “should.”
…Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you
went through… Something happened. I guess it doesn’t matter how much I
love him, or how much you love him. I guess it’s like you said, the only
thing that counts is what’s best for Billy. I don’t know, maybe that’s
all love is anyway… Ted, I think Billy should stay with you…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: He’s already got one mother, he doesn’t need
two… He’s yours… I won’t fight you for him any more. He’s yours…</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Oh, God… Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Only can I still see him?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: No more waiting in Coffee Shops… I promise.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Okay… I think I’ll go talk to my son now.
How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
