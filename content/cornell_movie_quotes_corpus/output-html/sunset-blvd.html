<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: We’ve come for the car.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What car?</p>
<p><strong>no. 2</strong>: 1946 Plymouth convertible. Calif- ornia
license 97 N 567.</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: Where are the keys?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why should I give you the keys?</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: Because the company’s played ball with you
long enough. Because you’re three payments behind. And because we’ve got
a Court order. Come on – the keys.</p>
<p><strong>no. 2</strong>: Or do you want us to jack it up and haul it
away?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Relax, fans. The car isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: Is that So?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up
to Palm Springs.</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: Had to get away for his health, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You don’t believe me? Look in the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>no. 1</strong>: Sure we believe you, only now we want you to
believe us. That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there’s
going to be fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You say the cutest things.</p>
<p><strong>shoeshine parlor</strong>: I knew they’d be coming never
asked any quest- ions. He’d just look at your heels and know the
score.</p>
<p><strong>men’s shop on bronson ave. gillis’ voice</strong>: I had an
original story prove it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: All right, Gillis. You’ve got five
minutes. What’s your story about?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It’s about a ball player, a rookie shortstop
that’s batting 347. The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up. But
he’s trying to go straight – except there’s a bunch of gamblers who
won’t let him.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: So they tell the kid to throw the World
Series, or else, huh?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: More or less. Only for the end I’ve got a
gimmick that’s real good.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Got a title?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Bases Loaded. There’s a 4O-page outline.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Get the Readers’ Department and see what
they have on Bases Loaded.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: They’re pretty hot about it over at
Twentieth, but I think Zanuck’s all wet. Can you see Ty Power as a</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I
covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: What’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s from hunger.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Nothing for Ladd?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just a rehash of something that wasn’t very
good to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: I’m sure you’ll be glad to meet
Mr. Gillis. He wrote it.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: This is Miss Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I
wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: If I could be of any help…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don’t think
it’s any good. I found it flat and banal.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Exactly what kind of material do you
recommend? James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Name dropper.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just think pictures should say a little
something.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Oh, you’re one of the message kids. Just a
story won’t do. You’d have turned down Gone With the Wind.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: No, that was me. I said, Who wants to see
a Civil War picture?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is
that I knew your name. I’d always heard you had some talent.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That was last year. This year I’m trying to
earn a living.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make
it slick –</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound
like a bunch of New York critics. Thank you, Miss Schaefer.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Goodbye. Next time I’ll write The Naked and
the Dead.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Well, seems like Zanuck’s got himself a
baseball picture.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Mr. Sheldrake, I don’t want you to think I
thought this was going to win any Academy Award.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Of course, we’re always looking for a
Betty Hutton. Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Frankly, no.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Now wait a minute. If we made it a girls’
softball team, put in a few numbers. Might make a cute musical: It
Happened in the Bull Pen – the story of a Woman.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You trying to be funny? – because I’m all
out of laughs. I’m over a barrel and I need a job.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Sure, Gillis. If something should come
along -</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Along is no good. I need it now.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Haven’t got a thing.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Any kind of assignment. Additional
Dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: There’s nothing, Gillis. Not even if you
were a relative.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have
three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?</p>
<p><strong>sheldrake</strong>: Could I? Gillis, last year some- body
talked me into buying a ranch in the valley. So I borrowed money from
the bank so I could pay for the ranch. This year I had to mortgage the
ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the
insurance so I could pay my income tax. Now if Dewey had been elected

just your agent. It’s not the ten per cent. I’m your friend.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How’s that about your being my friend?</p>
<p><strong>morino</strong>: Don’t you know the finest things in the
world have been written on an empty stomach? Once a talent like yours
gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you’re through.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Forget Romanoff’s. It’s the car I’m talking
about. If I lose my car it’s like having my legs out off.</p>
<p><strong>morino</strong>: Greatest thing that could happen to you. Now
you’ll have to sit behind that typewriter. Now you’ll have to write.</p>

<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’ve made up my mind we’ll bury him in the
garden. Any city laws against that?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I don’t care anyway. I want the coffin to be
white. And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep
pink.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Maybe red. bright flaming red. Gay. Let’s
make it gay.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: How much will it be? I warn you - don’t give
me a fancy price just because I’m rich.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Lady. you’ve got the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire. I
pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an
empty house.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It is not. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m sorry, and I’m sorry you lost your
friend, and I don’t think red is the right color.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure. Wait a minute – haven’t I seen you –
?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Or shall I call my servant?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I know your face. You’re Norma Desmond. You
used to be in pictures. You used to be big.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I am big. It’s the pictures that got
small.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I knew there was something wrong with
them.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: They’re dead. They’re finished. There was a
time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that
wasn’t good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So
they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s where the popcorn business comes in.
You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Look at them in the front offices – the
master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and
the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got
now? Some nobodies – a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Don’t get sore at me. I’m not an executive.
I’m just a writer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You are! Writing words, words! You’ve made a
rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone
right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the
red, swollen tongue!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Ssh! You’ll wake up that monkey.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Next time I’ll bring my autograph album
along, or maybe a hunk of cement and ask for your footprints.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Just a minute, you!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re a writer, you said.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Are you or aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I think that’s what it says on my driver’s
license.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: And you have written pictures, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure have. The last one I wrote was about
cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing
played on a torpedo boat.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I want to ask you something. Come in
here.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I
ought to have it taken out.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Or teach it a better tune.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: How long is a movie script these days? I
mean, how many pages?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Depends on what it is – a Donald Duck or
Joan or Arc.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: This is to be a very important picture. I
have written it myself. Took me years.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Looks like enough for six impor- tant
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It’s the story or Salome. I think I’ll have
DeMille direct it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: We’ve made a lot of pictures together.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: And you’ll play Salome?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Who else ?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Only asking. I did’t know you were planning
a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I hate that word. It is a return. A return to
the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Salome – what a woman! What a part! The
Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven
Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing
his cold, dead lips.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: They’ll love it in Pomona.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: They will love it every place. Read it. Read
the scene just before she has him killed!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Right now? Never let another writer read
your stuff. He may steal it.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I am not afraid. Read it!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ve got twenty-twenty vision.</p>

<p><strong>norma</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: This is fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Maybe it’s a little long and maybe there are
some repetitions… but you’re not a professional writer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I wrote that with my heart.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure you did. That’s what makes it great.
What it needs is a little more dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What for? I can say anything I want with my
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It certainly could use a pair of shears and
a blue pencil.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I will not have it butchered.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Of course not. But it ought to be organized.
Just an editing job. You can find somebody.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Who? I’d have to have somebody I can trust.

<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><strong>norma</strong>: Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can
trust them.</p>

<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Me? I’m busy. Just finished one script. I’m
due on another assignment.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You know, I’m pretty expensive. I get five
hundred a week.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I wouldn’t worry about money. I’ll make it
worth your while.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Maybe I’d better take the rest of the script
home and read it -</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Oh no. I couldn’t let it out of my house.
You’ll have to finish it here.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It’s getting kind of late –</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Are you married, Mr. – ?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: The name is Gillis. I’m single.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hollywood. The Alto Nido Apart- ments.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: There’s something wrong with your car, you
said.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: There sure is.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You can stay here.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ll come early tomorrow.</p>

are too young. In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters. Men

what are my things doing here?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m talking to you. My clothes and things
are up in the room.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Naturally. I brought them myself.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Is that so!</p>

missing?</p>

apartment.</p>

three months’ rent.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ll take care of that.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It’s all taken care of. It’s all paid
for.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m used to paying my own bills.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You proud boy, why didn’t you tell me you
were having difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Okay. We’ll deduct it from my salary.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Now, now, don’t let’s be small about such
matters. We won’t keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis’ things.</p>

<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ve lost my car.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Oh…and I thought it was a matter of life and
death.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It is to me. That’s why I came to this
house. That’s why I took this job – ghost writing!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Now you’re being silly. We don’t need two
cars. We have a car. And not one of thuse cheap new things made of
chromium and spit. An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you ever heard of
Isotta-Fraschinis? All hand-made. Cost me twenty-eight thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That’s a dreadful shirt you’re wearing.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What’s wrong with It?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.
And I’m getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same
baggy pants. Max, what’s a good men’s shop in town? The very best… Well,
go there !</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I don’t need any clothes, and I certainly
don’t want you buy- ing them for –</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you
to look nice, my stray little boy.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: There’s nothing like gray flannel with a
chalk stripe. This one single-breasted, of course. Now we need a
topcoat. Let’s see what you have in camel’s hair.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: How about some evening clothes?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I don’t need a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Tails. That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’ll need them for parties. You’ll need
them for New Year’s Eve. Where are your evening clothes?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: This way, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Here are some camel hairs, but I’d like
you just to feel this one. It’s Vicuna. Of course, it’s a little more
expensive.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: A camel’s hair will do.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: As long as the lady is paying for it, why
not take the Vicuna?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Whose room was this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was the room of the husband. Or of the
husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I guess this is the one you can see Catalina
from. Only this isn’t the day.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hey, what’s this with the door? There isn’t
any lock.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There are no locks anywhere in this house.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The doctor suggested it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What doctor?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Madame’s doctor. She has moments of melancholy.
There have been some suicide attempts.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills,
no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why? Her career? She got enough out of it.
She’s not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wouldn’t look too closely at the
postmarks.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You send them. Is that it, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’d better press your evening clothes, sir. You
have not for- gotten Madame’s New Year’s party.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: No, I haven’t. I suppose all the waxworks
are coming?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know, sir. Madame made the
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn
around!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Perfect. Wonderful shoulders. And I love that
line.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: All padding. Don’t let it fool you.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Come here!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You know, to me dressing up was always just
putting on my dark blue suit.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I don’t like those studs they’ve sent. I want
you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Now, I’m not going to wear ear- rings, I can
tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Cute. Let’s have some drinks.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Shouldn’t we wait for the others?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Careful, it’s slippery. I had it waxed.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Here’s to us.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You know, this floor used to be wood but I
had it changed. Valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a
tango.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Not on the same floor with Valentino!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Just follow me.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t bend back like that.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It’s those feathers. They tickle.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It’s a quarter past ten. What time are they
supposed to get here?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: The other guests?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: There are no other guests. We don’t want to
share this night with other people. This is for you and me.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I understand some rich guy bought up all the
tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening
to La Traviata, all by himself. He was afraid of catching cold.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Hold me tighter.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Come midnight, how about blind- folding the
orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max’s head?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You think this is all very funny.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Is it funny that I’m in love with you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’m in love with you. Don’t you know that?
I’ve been in love with you all along.</p>

What fun we’re going to have. I’II fill the pool for you. Or I’ll open
my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean. Or I’ll buy you a
boat and we’ll sail to Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Stop it. You aren’t going to buy me anything
more.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t be silly. Here. I was going to give it
to you at midniglht.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Read what’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What are the notes?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: “Mad about the boy.”</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Norma, I can’t take it. You’ve bought me
enough.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Shut up. I’m rich. I’m richer than all this
new Hollywood trash. I’ve got a million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in
Bakersfield – pumping, pumping, pumping. What’s it for but to buy us
anything we want.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Cut out that us business.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What right do you have to take me for
granted?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What right? Do you want me to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Has it ever occurred that I may have a life
of my own? That there may be some girl I’m crazy about?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why not? What I’m trying to say is that I’m
all wrong for you. You want a Valentino – somebody with polo ponies – a
big shot –</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What you’re trying to say is that you don’t
want me to love you. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hi, Artie.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Where have you been keeping that gorgeous
face of yours?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: In a deep freeze.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: I almost reported you to the Bureau of
Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen
writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Give me your coat.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Let it ride for a while.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: You’re going to stay, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That was the general idea.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: What is this - mink?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that
from? Adolphe Menjou?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Close, but no cigar.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Say, you’re not really smuggling opium these
days, are you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Where’s the bar?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good party.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell
of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only
calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Sure, this’ll go on all night.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I mean, could you put me up for a couple of
weeks?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: It just so happens we have a vacancy on the
couch.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: I’ll have the bell-hop take care of your
luggage.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Just register here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hello, Mr. Gillis.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: You know each other?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake’s
office.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure. Bases Loaded.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Wait a minute. This is the woman I love.
What’s going on? Who was loaded?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s just a fan for my
literary output.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hurt feelings department.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: About that luggage. Where’s the phone?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Over by the Rainbow Room.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: When youlre through with that thing, can I
have it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You forgot this.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve been hoping to run into you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What for? To recover that knife you stuck in
my back?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of
your old stories.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why, you sweet kid.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s one called….Window… something with a
window.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Dark Windows. How did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Except for about six pages. You’ve got a
flashback there …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is there someplace we can talk?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How about the Rainbow Room?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: I said you could have my couch. I didn’t say
you could have my girl.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is shop talk.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Now if I got you correctly, there was a
short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The flashback in the courtroom, when she
tells about being a school teacher.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I had a teacher like that once.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Maybe that’s why it’s good. It’s true, it’s
moving. Now why don’t you use that character…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Who wants true? Who wants moving?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Drop that attitude. Here’s some- thing really
worth while.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Want me to start right now? Maybe there’s
some paper around.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m serious. I’ve got a few ideas.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ve got some ideas myself. One of them
being this is New Year’s Eve. How about living it up a little?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: As for instance?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Well….</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We could make some paper boats and have a
regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How about capturing the kitchen and
barricading the door?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese
jungle. I am starving, Lady Agatha – starving for a white shoulder –</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Phillip, you’re mad!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You can have the phone now.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Thirsting for the coolness of your lips
-</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, Phillip, no. We must be strong. You’re
still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards! Furthermore, you can
have the phone now.</p>
<p><strong>o.k.</strong>: I find I’m terribly afraid of losing you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You won’t. I’ll get us a refill of this awful
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You’ll be waiting for me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: With a wildly beating heart.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Life can be beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Max? This is Mr. Gillis. I want you to do me
a favor.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I am sorry, Mr. Gillis. I cannot talk now.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yes you can. I want you to get my old
suitcase and I want you to throw in my old clothes – the ones I came
with, and my typewriter. I’ll have somebody pick them up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have no time to talk. The doctor is here.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What doctor? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She got the razor from your room. She cut her
wrists.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Max ! Max !</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just got the recipe: take two packages of
cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice –</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She is upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Be careful. Do not race up the stairs. The
musicians must not know what has happened.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What kind of a silly thing was that to
do?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: To fall in love with you – that was the
idiotic thing.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It sure would have made attractive
headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Great stars have great pride.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Go away. Go to that girl of yours.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Look, I was making that up because I thought
the whole thing was a mistake. I didn’t want to hurt you. You’ve been
good to me. You’re the only person in this stinking town that has been
good to me.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Why don’t you just say thank you and go, go,
go –</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Not until you promise to act like a sensible
human being.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’ll do it again, I’ll do it again, I’ll do
it again!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Happy New Year.</p>

<p><strong>betty</strong>: Is this Crestview 5-1733? … I’m sorry to
bother you again, but I’ve confirmed the number. I must speak to
Mr. Gillis.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He is not here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Where can I reach him? Maybe somebody else in
the house could tell me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nobody here can give you any information. You
will please not call again.</p>
<p><strong>norma’s voice</strong>: Who was it, Max? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nothing, Madame. Somebody Inqu- iring about a
stray dog. We must have a number very similar to the pound.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car.
You’re going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to
Mr. De Mille in person.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You’re really going to send it to De
Mille?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: This is the right day.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Did she read the script?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: DeMille is Leo. I’m Scorpio. Mars has been
transmitting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of greatest conjuction.
Now turn around. Let me dry you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts
don’t sell on astrologers’ charts.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’m not just selling the script. I’m selling
me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: When did he say it, Norma?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: So he said it quite a few years ago. So what?
I never looked better in my life. Do you know why? Because I’ve never
been as happy in my life.</p>

have it!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hello, Artie. Good evening, Miss
Schaefer.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You don’t know how glad I am to see youl</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Walking out on the mob. What’s the big
idea?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m sorry about New Year’s. Would you
believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a
ten-carat kidney stone.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Stop it, Artie, will you? Where have you been
keeping your- self? I’ve got the most wonderful news for you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I haven’t been keeping myself at all. Not
lately.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I called your agent. I called the Screen
Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.
There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not
there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Is that so? What’s the wonderful news?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sheldrake likes that angle about the
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What teacher?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about
it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He thinks it could be made into
something.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Into what? A lampshade?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They
have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Unless you’d rather have Sarah Bernhardt.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is on the level. Sheldrake really went
for it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: O.K. Where’s the cash?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Where’s the story? I bluffed it out with a
few notions of my own. It’s really just a springboard. It needs
work.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I was afraid of that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve got twenty pages of notes. I’ve got a
pretty good character for the man.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Could you write in plenty of back- ground
action, so they’ll need an extra assistant director?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Shut up, Artie. Now if we could sit down for
two weeks and get a story.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I’ve given up
writing on spec.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I tell you this is half sold.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: As a matter of fact. I’ve given up writing
altogether.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mr. Gillis, if you please.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Right with you.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: The accent! I’ve got it: this guy is in the
pay of a foreign government. Get those studs. Get those cuff-links.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ve got to run along. Thanks any- way for
your interest in my career.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s not your career – it’s mine. I kind of
hoped to get in on this deal. I don’t want to be a reader all my life. I
want to write.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sorry if I crossed you up.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You sure have.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>artie</strong>: Babe, it’s like that producer says: In life,
you’ve got to take the bitter with the sour.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What on earth, darling? It took you
hours.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I ran into some people I knew.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Where are my cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Where are your…?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Norma, you’re smoking too much.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: This is a rock.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I can still see myself in the line: Bebe
Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand … Mabel was always stepping on my
feet …What’s the matter with you, darling? Why are you so glum?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Nothing is the matter. I’m having a great
time. Show me some more.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: All right. Give me this. I need it for a
moustache. Now close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>norma’s voice</strong>: Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Madame is wanted on the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You know better than to interrupt me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Paramount is calling.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Paramount studios.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille
would jump at it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone
by the name or Gordon Cole. He says it’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Certainly it’s important. It’s important
enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an
assistant call me!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille’s
manners.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Say that I’m busy, and hang up.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Very good, Madam.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: How do you like that? We’ve made twelve
pictures together. His greatest successes.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Maybe deMille is shooting.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.
He’s trying to get my price down. I’ve waited twenty years for this
call. Now Mr. deMille can wait till I’m good and ready.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over
the left eye is not quite balanced.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Thank you, Max.</p>
<p><strong>young policeman</strong>: Hold that noise!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: To see Mr. de Mille. Open the gate.</p>
<p><strong>young policeman</strong>: Mr. deMille is shooting. You got an
appointment?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No appointment is necessary. I am bringing
Norma Desmond.</p>
<p><strong>young policeman</strong>: Norma Who?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Jonesy! Come here, Jonesy!</p>
<p><strong>old policeman</strong>: Yeah? Why, if it isn’t Miss Desmond!
How have you been, Miss Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Fine, Jonesy. Now open that gate.</p>
<p><strong>old policeman</strong>: Sure, Miss Desmond. Come on, Mac.</p>
<p><strong>young policeman</strong>: They can’t drive on the lot without
a pass.</p>
<p><strong>old policeman</strong>: Miss Desmond can. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>old policeman</strong>: Stage eighteen, Miss Desmond.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Thank you, Jonesy. And teach your friend some
manners. Tell him without me he wouldn’t have any job, because without
me there wouldn’t be any Paramount Studio. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>old policeman</strong>: Norma Desmond coming in to see
Mr. deMille.</p>
<p><strong>stage hand</strong>: Norma Desmond is coming to see
Mr. deMille.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: Norma Desmond is coming in to see
you, Mr. deMille.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: Norma Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: I hate to think where that puts me. I could
be her father.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: I’m terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: It must be about that appalling script of
hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: I can tell her you’re all tied up in
the projection room. I can give her the brush …</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: Listen, thirty million fans have given her
the brush. Isn’t that enough?</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: I didn’t mean to –</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: Of course you didn’t. You didn’t know Norma
Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit
and heart than ever came together in one youngster.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: I hear she was a terror to work
with.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: She got to be. A dozen press agents working
overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold
everything.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t you want to come along, darling?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I don’t think so. It’s your script. It’s
your show. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Thank you, darling.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Hello, young fellow.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Hello, Mr. deMille.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I
remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Lots of people were. Lindbergh had just
landed in Paris. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Norma, I want to apologize for not calling
you.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’d better. I’m very angry.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: I’m pretty busy, as you can see…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That’s no excuse. You read the script, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Then you could have picked up the phone
yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: What assistant?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t play innocent. Somebody named Gordon
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Gordon Cole?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: And if you hadn’t been pretty darned
interested in that script, he wouldn’t have tried to get me on the phone
ten times.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Gordon Cole… Look, Norma, I’m in the
middle of a rehearsal. Make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Get me Gordon Cole on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Hey, Miss Desmond! Miss Desmond!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Up here!</p>
<p><strong>electrician</strong>: It’s met It’s Hog-eyel</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>hog-eye</strong>: Let’s get a look at you.</p>
<p><strong>extras</strong>: Say, it’s Norma! Norma Desmond!</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Hello, Miss Desmond. It’s Bessie.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Prop Department. Gordon Cole speaking.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Cole, this is C. B. deMille. Have you been
calling Norma Desmond?… What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s that car of hers – an old
Isotta-Fraschini. Her chauffeur drove it on the lot the other day. It
looks just right for the Crosby picture. We want to rent it for a couple
of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Oh. Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Well, Norma … I got hold of Gordon
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Did you see them? Did you see how they
came?</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: You know, crazy things happen in this
business. I hope you haven’t lost your sense of humor …</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: What’s the matter, Norma?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Nothing. I just didn’t realize what it would
be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I’d missed
it.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: We’ve missed you too, dear.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: We’ll be working again, won’t we, Chief?
We’ll make our greatest picture.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: That’s what I want to talk to you
about.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It’s a good script, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: It’s got a lot of good things. Of course,
it would be an expensive picture…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I don’t care about the money. I just want to
work again. You don’t know what it means to know that you want me.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: Nothing would thrill me more – if it were
possible.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: But remember, darling – I don’t work before
ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: We’re ready with the shot,
Mr. deMille.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: You’ll pardon me, Norma? Why don’t you just
sit and watch? O.K. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: Roll ’em.</p>
<p><strong>demille</strong>: Action!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: of offices in the</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That didn’t leave much for Wallace Reid.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He had a great big bungalow on wheels. I had
the upstairs. See where it says ‘Readers’ Department’? I remember my
walls were covered with black patent leather…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’ll be with you in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>1st prop man</strong>: Hey, that’s the comic car Cole was
talking about! Do you mind if we look inside?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go away. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Just so you don’t think I’m a complete swine
– if there’s anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it. It’s all
yours.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, for heaven’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Have a chair.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I mean it. It’s no good to me anyway. Help
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why should you do that?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: If you get a hundred thousand for it, you
buy me a box of chocolate creams. If you get an Oscar, I get the left
foot.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You know, I’d take you up on that in a
minute. I’m just not good enough to do it all by myself.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What about all those ideas you had?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: See if they make sense. To begin with, I
think you should throw out all that psychological stuff – exploring a
killer’s sick mind.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This story is about teachers – their
threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most
important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough
money to re-sole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase,
any gunplay.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Now I see her teaching day classes while he
teaches night school. The first time they meet …</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Look, if you don’t mind, I haven’t got time
to listen to the whole plot …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ll make it short.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sorry. It’s your baby now.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m not good enough to write it alone. We’ll
have to do it together.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m all tied up. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Couldn’t we work in the evenings? Six o’clock
in the morning? This next month I’m completely at your disposal. Artie
is out of town.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What has Artie to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We’re engaged.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good for you. You’ve got yourself the best
guy in town.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I think so. They’re on location in Arizona,
shooting a Western. I’m free every evening, every week- end. If you
want, we could work at your place.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: It’s just impossible.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nobody can be that busy.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Look, Betty, It can’t be done. It’s out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re tough, all right.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You’re on your own. Stop being
chicken-hearted and write that story.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Honest to goodness, I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: And don’t make it too dreary. How about this
for a situation: she teaches daytimes. He teaches at night. Right? They
don’t even know each other, but they share the same room. It’s cheaper
that way. As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed – in shifts,
of oourse.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you kidding? Because I think it’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Came on back. Let me show you where it fits
in.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, you –</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: And here’s a title: AN APPLE FOR</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What’s the matter, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I just found out why all those tele- phone
calls. It is not Miss Desmond they want. It is the car they want to
rent.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ssh…</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Goodbye, young fellow. We’ll see what we
can do.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’m not worried. Everything will be fine. The
old team together. Nothing can stop us.</p>
<p><strong>de mille</strong>: Get Gordon Cole. Tell him to forget about
her car. He can find another old car. I’ll buy him five old cars, if
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>1st assistant</strong>: Yes, Mr. De Mille.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It couldn’t have gone better. It’s
practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but
mine will be his next.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: He must be quite a guy.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: He’a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box
office. Only I’m going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn’t going to be C.
B. deMille’s Salome. It’s going to be Norma Desmond’s Salome, a Norma
Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond…Home, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, Miss Desmond.</p>

<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yes, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t turn around. Keep your eyes on the
book.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yes, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I just came to say good night. I don’t want
you to see me – I’m not very attractive.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’ve lost half a pound since Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I was a little worried about the line of my
throat. This woman has done wonders with it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’d better get to bed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I think I’ll read a little.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You went out last night, didn’t you, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare
and I screamed for you. You weren’t here. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I went for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No you didn’t. You took the car.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you
don’t want me to feel I’m locked up in this house?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Of course not, Joe. It’s just that I don’t
want to be left alone. Not now, while I’m under this terrible strain. My
nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient
and a little kind.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I haven’t done anything, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Of course you haven’t. I wouldn’t let
you.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Good night, my darling.</p>
<p><strong>e-7 living room</strong>: it was to try and write</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I got the funniest letter from Artie. It’s
rained every day since they got to Arizona. They re-wrote the whole
picture for rain and shot half of it. Now the sun is out. Nobody knows
when they’ll get back.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What’s good about it? I miss him something
fierce.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I mean this is good dialogue along in here.
It’ll play.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It will?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure. Especially with lots of music
underneath, drowning it out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Don’t you sometimes hate yourself?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Constantly. No, in all serious- ness, it’s
really good. It’s fun writing again. I’m happy here, honest I am.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who’s Norma?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Who’s who?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t usually read private
cigarette cases.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Oh, that. It’s from a friend of mine. A
middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ll say. This is solid gold.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I gave her some advice on an idiotic
script.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s that old familiar story, you help a
timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a
multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s the trouble with you readers. You
know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water
boils.</p>

<p><strong>betty</strong>: Look at this street. All card- board, all
hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors. I like it better than any
street in the world. Maybe because I used to play here when I was a
kid.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What were you – a child actress?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I was born just two blocks from this studio.
Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec- trician here till he
died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Second generation, huh?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl
White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted
I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons,
diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn’t like my
nose – it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it
fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose – only
they didn’t like my acting.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: by the flame of his</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Saddest thing I ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I
got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I’m a
reader…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Come clean, Betty. At night you weep for
those lost closeups, those gala openings…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Not once. What’s wrong with being on the
other side of the cameras? It’s really more fun.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now
kiss that nose of yours.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you please.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: May I say you smell real special.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It must be my new shampoo.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s no shampoo. It’smore like a pile of
freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile. How old
are you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s it – there’s nothing like being
twenty-two. Now may I suggest that if we’re ever to finish this story
you keep at least two feet away from me … Now back to the
typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or
are you doing a little spying in your off hours?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You must be very careful as you cross the
patio. Madame may be watching.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: How about my going up the kitchen stairs and
undressing in the dark. Will that do it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every
night…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why don’t you? I’m writing a script and I’m
dying to finish it, no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s just that I’m very worried about
Madame.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Sure you are. And we’re not help- ing her
any, feeding her lies and more lies. Getting herself ready for a pioture
… What happens when she finds out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She never will. That is my job. It has been for
a long time. You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.
I made her a star. I cannot let her be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You made her a star?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I directed all her early pictures. There were
three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith,
C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: And she’s turned you into a servant.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as
it may seem. I could have gone on witn my career, only I found
everything unendur- able arter she divorced me. You see, I was her rirst
husband.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re here, Joe … When did you come home?
Where were you? Is it a woman? I know it’s a woman … Who is she? Oh Joe,
why can’t I ask you? I must know, I must!</p>

<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter… Betty, wake up! Why
are you staring at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Was I? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What’s wrong with you tonight? What is it,
Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Something came up. I don’t want to talk about
it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What is it you’ve heard. Come on, let’s have
it.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Is it about me?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Betty, there’s no use running out on it.
Let’s face it, what- ever it is.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s nothing. I got a telegram from
Artie.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: From Artie. What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it
only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a
honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why don’t you? We can finish the script by
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Stop crying. You’re getting married. That’s
what you’ve always wanted.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t want it now.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Why not? Don’t you love Artie?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Of course I love him. I always will. I’m just
not in love with him any more.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You did.</p>

<p><strong>norma’s voice</strong>: Is this Gladstone 0858?</p>
<p><strong>e-21 norma’s bedroom</strong>: Norma lies in bed, dialing a
number. She has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over
her nose.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer? She must
be home by now.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Betty, here’s that weird-sounding woman
again.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What is this anyway? This is Betty
Schaefer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for
calling you so late, but I really feel it’s my duty. It’s about
Mr. Gillis. You do know Mr. Gillis? …Exactly how much do you know about
him? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how he lives? Do you know
what he lives on?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who are you? What do you want? What business
is it of yours anyway?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Miss Schaefer, I’m trying to do you a favor.
I’m trying to spare you a great deal of misery. Of course you may be too
young to even suspect there are men of his sort…</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s right, Betty, ask me again. This is
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Joe, where are you? What’s this all
about?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Or maybe it would be a better idea if you
came over and saw it for yourself. The address is 10086 .</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Don’t hate me, Joe. I did it because I need
you. I need you as I never needed you. Look at me. Look at my hands,
look at my face, look under my eyes. How can I go back to work if I’m
wasting away under this torment? You don’t know what I’ve been through
these last weeks. I got myself a revolver. You don’t believe me, but I
did, I did! I stood in front of that mirror, only I couldn’t make
myself. It wouldn’t be</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yes, I hear you. And I wish you’d keep still
so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Here’s ten thousand seventy-nine, Betty. It
must be over there.</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Betty, let me come along with you.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I love you, Joe. I love you, Joe. I love you,
Joe. I love you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What are you going to do, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>gillis’ voice</strong>: It’s all right, Max. I’ll take
it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hello, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know why I’m so scared, Joe. Is it
something awful?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Come on in, Betty,</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Ever been in one of these old Hollywood
palazzos? That’s from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week,
and no taxes. Careful of these tiles, they’re slippery. Valentino used
to dance here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is where you live?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Whose house is it?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Hers.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Just look around. There’s a lot of her
spread about. If you don’t remember the face, you must have heard the
name of Norma Desmond.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That was Norma Desmond on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Want something to drink? There’s always
champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why did she call me?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Jealous. Ever see so much junk? She had the
ceiling brought from Portugal. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Her own movie theatre.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I didn’t come here to see a house. What about
Norma Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: I’m trying to tell you. This is an enormous
place. Eight master bedrooms. A sunken tub in every bathroom. There’s a
bowling alley in the cellar. It’s lonely here, so she got herself a
companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do. A
younger man who is not doing too well … Can you figure it out
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: All right. I’ll give you a few more
clues.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, no! I haven’t heard any of this. I never
got those telephone calls. I’ve never been in this house … Get your
things together. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: All my things? All the eighteen suits, all
the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links
and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Come on, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment
that I can’t pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly
will not?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you love me, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Look, sweetie – be practical. l’ve got a
good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that
way. Maybe it’s not very admirable. Well, you and Artie can be
admirable.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Joe, I can’t look at you any more.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Nobody asked you to.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: All right, baby. This way out.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Good luck to you, Betty. You can finish that
story on the way to Arizona. When you and Artie get back, if the two of
you ever feel like a swim, here’s the pool …</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Thank you, Joe – thank you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: May I come in? I’ve stopped cry- ing. I’m all
right again. Joe, tell me you’re not cross – tell me everything is just
as it was, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing?
You’re not leaving me?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Yes, I am, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No, you’re not. Max! Max!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Max is a good idea. He can help with my
luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe. And thanks
for the use of all the trinkets.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: The rest of the jewelry is in the top
drawer.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: It’s yours, Joe. I gave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: And I’d take it in a second, Norma – only
it’s a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton,
Ohio.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: These are nothing. You can have anything you
want if you’ll only stay. What is it you want – money?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Norma, you’d be throwing it away. I don’t
qualify for the job, not any more.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You can’t do this! Max! Max! … I can’t face
life without you, and I’m not afraid to die, you know.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: That’s between you and yourself, Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You think I made that up about the gun…</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: See, you didn’t believe me!.. Now I suppose
you don’t think I have the courage!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Oh. sure – if it would make a good
scene.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You don’t care. do you? But hundreds of
thousands of people will carel</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Wake up, Norma. You’d be killing yourself to
an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That’s a lie! They still want me!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: No, they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What about the studio? What about De
Mille?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: He was trying to spare your feelings. The
studio wanted to rent your car.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Wanted what?</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: De Mille didn’t have the heart to tell you.
None of us has had the heart.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That’s a lie! They want me, they want me! I
get letters every day!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that
favor. Tell her there isn’t going to be any picture – there aren’t any
fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: That isn’t true! Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Madame is the greatest star of them all… I will
take Mr. Gillis’ bags.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You heard him. I’m a star!</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Norma, grow up. You’re a woman of fifty.
There’s nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be
twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I’m the greatest star of them all.</p>
<p><strong>gillis</strong>: Goodbye. Norma.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: No one leaves a star. That makes one a
star.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re not leaving me!</p>
<p><strong>norma’s voice</strong>: Joe! …Joe!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re not leaving me!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: You’re not leaving me!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Stars are ageless, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Coroner’s office? … I want to speak to
the Coroner … Who’s on this phone?</p>
<p><strong>miss hopper</strong>: I am! Now get off, this is more
important … Times City Desk? Hedda Hopper speaking. I’m talking from the
bedroom of Norma Desmond. Don’t bother with a rewrite man, take this
direct. Ready? – As day breaks over the murder house, Norma Desmond,
famed star of yesteryear, is in a state of complete mental shock …</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: You do not deny having killed
this man, Miss Desmond?</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Did you intend to kill him? Just
answer me that.</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: Was it a sudden quarrel? Had
there been any trouble between you before?</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: If it was a quarrel, how come you
had the gun right there?</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: This guy – where did you meet
him for the first time? Where did he come from? Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Did he have a wife? Did he had a
girl friend? Did you know them?</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: Had he been trying to
blackmail you?</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Did the deceased ever threaten
you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: Did you hate him? Had you ever
thought of doing something like this before?</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Was theft involved? Did you catch
him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: The newsreel guys have arrived with the
cameras.</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Tell them to go fly a kite. This
is no time for cameras.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Cameras? …What is it, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The cameras have arrived, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I
will be on the set at once.</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please …</p>
<p><strong>holmby hills captain</strong>: Well, it’s one way to get her
down stairs.</p>
<p><strong>head of homicide</strong>: Okay. And let’s have the car right
outside.</p>
<p><strong>7-1 norma</strong>: You will pardon me, gentlemen. I have to
get ready for my scene.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is everything set up, gentlemen? Are the lights
ready?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is everything set up, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Just about.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Are the lights ready?</p>
<p><strong>2nd camera man</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Quiet, everybody! Lights! Are you ready,
Norma?</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: What is the scene? Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This is the staircase of the palace.</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: Oh, yes, yes. They’re below, waiting for the
Princess … I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All right. Camera! Action!</p>
<p><strong>norma</strong>: I can’t go on with the scene. I’m too happy.
Do you mind, Mr. DeMille, if I say a few words? Thank you. I just want
to tell you how happy I am to be back in the studio making a picture
again. You don’t know how much I’ve missed all of you. And I promise you
I’ll never desert you again, because after “Salome” we’ll make another
picture, and another and another. You see, this is my life. It always
will be. There’s nothing else - just us and the cameras and those
wonderful people out there in the dark… All right, Mr. DeMille, I’m
ready for my closeup.</p>
