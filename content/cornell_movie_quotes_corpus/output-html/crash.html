<h1 id="crash">crash</h1>
<p><strong>ad</strong>: I’m looking for James. Has anybody seen James
Ballard? You know who I mean? The producer of this epic.</p>
<p><strong>grip</strong>: I think I saw him in the camera
department.</p>
<p><strong>ad</strong>: James? James, are you in there? Could we please
get your stamp of approval on our little tracking shot?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Of course. Be there in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>camera girl</strong>: It’ll take more than a minute.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody
could have walked in.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Did you come?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No. What about your camera girl? Did she
come?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: We were interrupted. I had to go back to the
set…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Poor darling. What can I do about Karen?
How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a
conquest.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I’ve been thinking about that, about you and
Karen.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: There, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Not a lot of action here.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: They consider this to be the airport
hospital. This ward is reserved for air-crash victims. The beds are kept
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: If I groundloop during my flying lesson
on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I’ll listen for you buzzing over.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an
aeronautical feel to it.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate the
licence approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: That’s going well, then.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Well, yes. You’re getting out of bed
tomorrow. They want you to walk.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: The other man, the dead man, his wife is
a doctor – Dr Helen Remington. She’s here, somewhere. As a patient, of
course. Maybe you’ll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: And her husband? What was he?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: He was a chemical engineer with a food
company.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: No smoking, please.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: Are you this gentleman’s wife? Mrs
Ballard?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>student nurse</strong>: You can stay for this, then.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Aida telephoned to say how sorry she was,
but could you look at the storyboards again, she’s made a number of
changes.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Where’s the car?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Outside in the visitors’ car-park.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What!? They brought the car here?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: My car, not yours. Yours is a complete
wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: The sergeant asked me to identify it. He
didn’t believe you’d gotten out alive.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s about time.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: It is?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: After being bombarded endlessly by
road-safety propaganda, it’s almost a relief to have found myself in an
actual accident.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: James Ballard?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Crash victim?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: We’ll deal with these later.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Dr. Remington…?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Both front wheels and the engine were
driven back into the driver’s section, bowing the floor. Blood still
marked the hood, streamers of black lace running toward the
windshield-wiper gutters.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Minute flecks were spattered across the
seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards,
cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed,
and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The
carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine
fluids.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You should have gone to the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wish I had. They bury the dead so
quickly – they should leave them lying around for months.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have
you visited her yet?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: No, I couldn’t. I feel too close to
her.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Renata tells me you’re going to rent a
car.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I can’t sit on this balcony forever. I’m
beginning to feel like a potted plant.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: How can you drive? James… your legs. You
can barely walk.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be
three times as many cars as there were before the accident.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’ve never really noticed. Is Renata
going with you?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I thought she might come along. Handling a
car again might be more tiring than I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’m amazed that she’ll let you drive
her.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re not envious?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Maybe I am a little. James, I’ve got to
leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Are we allowed to park here?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: I’m sure the police would make an exception
in your case.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: There’s still a patch of blood there on the
road. Did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: I saw the blood. It looks like motor
oil.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You were the last one I saw just before the
accident. Do you remember? We made love.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Are you still involving me in your
crash?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Who is that man? Is he a private
detective?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Can you drive?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I can drive.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I can’t believe you’ve done this.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This is the exact same car as your old one,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Yes, it is. Are you planning to have
another car crash?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I’m not thinking about the crash at all.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: After this sort of thing, how do people
manage to look at a car, let alone drive one? I’m trying to find
Charles’s car.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s not here. Maybe the police are still
holding it. Their forensic people…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They said it was here. They told me this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This is your car?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’ll tear your gloves.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I don’t think we should have come here. I’m
surprised the police don’t make it more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each
other at the hospital. I don’t want the car. In fact, I was appalled to
find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself
driving again.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You haven’t told me where we’re going.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Haven’t I? To the airport, if you could.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The airport? Why? Are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not yet – though not soon enough for some
people, I’ve already found. A death in the doctor’s family makes the
patients doubly uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I take it you’re not wearing white to
reassure them.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: So – why the airport?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I work in the immigration department
there.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke
at the hospital. It’s rather stupid of me.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Look at all this traffic. I’m not sure I can
deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s much worse now. You noticed that, did
you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that
all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn’t
understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Are we imagining it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ve bought yourself exactly the same car
again. It’s the same shape and colour.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Turn up here into the car-park. It won’t be
busy this time of day.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ve found that I enjoy burying myself in
heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi-driver to
drive me around for an hour. ‘Anywhere,’ I said. We sat in a massive
traffic jam under an off- ramp. I don’t think we moved more than fifty
yards. I’m thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research
Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger –
something I’ve got to think about now. There’s a certain moral virtue in
being materialistic, I’m beginning to feel. Well, it’s a new approach
for me, in any case.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The Road Research Laboratory? Where they
simulate car crashes?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Isn’t that rather too close…?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s the point. Besides, I know I can give
something now that I wasn’t remotely aware of before. It’s not a matter
of duty so much as of commitment.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: I almost forgot to give you this. Probably
because I know you’re going to like it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: A complimentary ticket for a special
stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show.
There’s a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discreet about
the location.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Really? What kind of exhibition is it?</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: I suspect it involves re-enactments of
famous car crashes. You know, Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert
Camus…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Serious. But you’ll have to take your new
friend, the female crash- test dummy. She dropped it off for you.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You’re not jealous, are you? You have to
understand… Helen and I had this strange, intense… experience
together.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: We’ve had a few of those ourselves, haven’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: ‘Don’t worry, that guy’s gotta see us!’
These were the confident last words of the brilliant young Hollywood
star James Dean as he piloted his Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a
date with death on a lonely stretch of California two-lane blacktop,
Route 466. ‘Don’t worry, that guy’s gotta see us.’ The year, 1955; the
day, September thirtieth; the time: now.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s strange – I thought all this would be
far more popular.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The real thing is available free of charge.
Besides, it’s not quite legal. They can’t advertise.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: The first star of our show is ‘Little
Bastard’, James Dean’s racing Porsche. He named it after himself, and
had his racing number, 130, painted on it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Who is that? The announcer. Do I know
him?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s Vaughan. He talked to you at the
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical
photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every
conceivable detail about our crash.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist
in international computerized traffic systems. I don’t know what he is
now.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: The second star is stuntman and former race
driver – Colin Seagrave, who will drive our replica of James Dean’s
car.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I myself shall play the role of James
Dean’s racing mechanic, Rolf W�therich, sent over from the Porsche
factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany. This mechanic was himself fated to die
in a car crash in Germany twenty- six years later. And the third and in
some ways most important party, the college student Donald Turnupseed,
played by movie stuntman Brett Trask.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Turnupseed was on his way back to his home
in Fresno for the weekend. James Dean was on his way to an automobile
race in Salinas, a dusty town in northern California. The two would only
meet for one moment, but it was a moment that would create a Hollywood
legend.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: You’ll notice that we are not wearing
helmets or safety padding of any kind, and our cars are not equipped
with roll cages or seat-belts. We depend solely on the skill of our
drivers for our safety, so that we can bring you the ultimate in
authenticity. All right, here we go. The fatal crash of James Dean!</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Is that part of the act or are they really
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. You can never be sure with
Vaughan. This is his show.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Rolf W�therich was thrown from the Porsche
and spent a year in the hospital recovering from his injuries. Donald
Turnupseed was found wandering around in a daze, basically unhurt. James
Dean died of a broken neck and became immortal.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hold me. I’m dizzy. I can’t stand up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know that man, Seagrave, the stunt driver.
I think he’s genuinely hurt.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: This is an illegal and unauthorized
automotive demonstration which is in contravention of the Highway
Traffic Act. You are all liable to fines and possible arrest and
confinement… Disperse at once! Disperse at once!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s the matter with Seagrave?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Hit his head, I think. His balance is
off.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Why are the police taking this all so
seriously?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s not the police. It’s the Department of
Transport. Internal politics. It’s a joke. They have no idea who we
really are.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: That was glib, wasn’t it? ‘James Dean died
of a broken neck and became immortal.’ But I couldn’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie down.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They did the James Dean crash. It seemed to
go perfectly. But he started to feel nauseous on the way back. I’m sure
it’s concussion.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: Ah, well… We’re familiar enough with that,
then, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I’d really like to work out the details of
the Jayne Mansfield crash with you. We could do the decapitation – her
head embedded in the windshield – and the little dead dog thing as well.
You know, the Chihuahuas in the back seat. I’ve got it figured out.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You know I’ll be ready, Vaughan. But I’ll
want to wear really big tits – out to here – so the crowd can see them
get cut up and crushed on the dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Don’t leave yet, Ballard. I want you to
help me.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Do you live here? With Seagrave?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I live in my car. This is my workshop.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: And this is the new project, Ballard.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What kind of help can I possibly be to you?
You seem to be everywhere at once as it is.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thought you might be missing these. So
here you are at the nerve centre. Vaughan makes everything look like a
crime, doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What exactly is your project, Vaughan? A book
of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global
traffic?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s something we’re all intimately
involved in: the reshaping of the human body by modern technology.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Vaughan, what the hell are you doing? Are you
trying to create your own Famous Crash?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It excited her, Ballard. Your wife,
Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: He must have fucked a lot of women in
that huge car of his. It’s like a bed on wheels. It must smell of
semen…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Do you find him attractive?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: He’s very pale. Covered with scars.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Would you like to fuck him, though? In
that car?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: No. But when he’s in that car…</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Have you seen his penis?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I think it’s badly scarred too. From a
motorcycle accident.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what
his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him?
Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his
anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would
you kiss him in that car? Describe how you’d reach over and unzip his
greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it
right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a
penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen?
Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan’s semen must be very
salty…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Have you come?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Please finish your story.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital.
Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist,
then the service manager at my garage.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: And you had sex with all of these men in
cars? Only in cars?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. I didn’t plan it that way.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: And did you fantasize that Vaughan was
photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic
accidents?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Get all the paper you can, Ballard. Some of
the stuff they’re giving away is terrific: ‘Mechanisms of Occupant
Ejection’, ‘Tolerances of the Human Face in Crash Impacts’…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We can have a look at it again on the
monitors. They’re showing it in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I’ve always wanted to drive a crashed
car.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: You could get your wish at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus’s
Facel Vega, or Nathaniel West’s station wagon, Grace Kelly’s Rover 3500.
Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don’t clean it, don’t touch
anything else.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Is that why you drive this car? I take it
that you see Kennedy’s assassination as a special kind of car crash?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: The case could be made.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Take a look at this and tell me what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s very… satisfying. I’m not sure I
understand why.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s the future, Ballard, and you’re
already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology
beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather
than a destructive event – a liberation of sexual energy that mediates
the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any
other form. To fully understand that, and to live that… that is my
project.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What about the reshaping of the human body by
modern technology? I thought that was your project.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the
surface and doesn’t threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of
my potential partners in psychopathology.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: You drive.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Let’s get rid of that. I don’t want you
blowing it up my urethra.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: Your friend’s still out there.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: What does he want from you?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>renata</strong>: I’m going to leave now. Do you want a
lift?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: No, thanks. I’ll go with Vaughan.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: They’re questioning Vaughan about an
accident near the airport. Some pedestrian… they think he was run over
intentionally.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Vaughan isn’t interested in pedestrians.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: You’d better drive him. He’s a bit shaky.
I’ll follow in my car. Where is yours?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: At home. I couldn’t face all this
traffic.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d better come with you, then. Are you
sure you can drive?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It’s Seagrave. He was worried that we would
never do Jayne Mansfield’s crash, now that the police were cracking
down. So he did it himself.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: The dog – God, the dog is brilliant,
perfect. I wonder where he got it?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: Come with me, James. I have to document
it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: We must have driven through a pool of blood.
If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have
the blood analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: You’re right, Ballard. There’s an all-night
car-wash in the airport service area.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Is there something here that interests
you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The white sports model. Could you help me
into it, please? I’d like to see if I can fit into a car designed for a
normal body.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Don’t. Not there.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Do it there. And then after that, do it
here.</p>
<p><strong>ad</strong>: Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want it?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Hello? Ballard.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk
to you about the project.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: You’re making it too clean.</p>
<p><strong>tattooist</strong>: Medical tattoos are supposed to be
clean.</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: This isn’t a medical tattoo. This is a
prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty and ragged. Make it dirty and
ragged.</p>
<p><strong>tattooist</strong>: Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy or
global prophesy?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: There’s no difference. James – I want you
to let her give you this one.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Where do you think that one should go?</p>
<p><strong>vaughan</strong>: It should go here.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I thought that was you, up there.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: My last lesson’s next week. James… my
car…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: What? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I wasn’t driving. I’d left the car in the
parking-lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: One of your suitors?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: One of my suitors.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: It’s Vaughan. He’s courting you. Let’s go
find him.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: The traffic… where is everyone? They’ve all
gone away.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: I’d like to go back. James…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Not yet. It’s only beginning.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Vera! Vera Seagrave!</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I’m trying to
find Vaughan.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: The police are after him. An American
serviceman was killed on the Northolt overpass.</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: I was with him in the car at the time.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I think he’ll be waiting for us at the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: James…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: I’d like to register a claim for the black
1963 Lincoln, the one that came in a couple of days ago. Is there a form
I can fill out?</p>
<p><strong>pound officer</strong>: There certainly is, but you’ll have
to come back between 7:30 and 4:30 to get one. What’s your attachment to
that thing?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: A close friend owned it.</p>
<p><strong>pound officer</strong>: Well, it’s got to be a total write-
off. I don’t see what you could possibly do with it.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Catherine. Are you all right? Are you
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>catherine</strong>: James, I… I don’t know… I think I’m all
right…</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Maybe the next one, darling… Maybe the next
one…</p>
