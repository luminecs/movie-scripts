<p><strong>sam cooke’s audience</strong>: Oh, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>lsg board member</strong>: “…the successor trustee shall be
fully authorized to pay or disperse such sums from the income or
principal as may be required.” Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay?</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Uh, yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>lsg board member</strong>: Are you sure, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Yeah. I follow you.</p>
<p><strong>lsg board member</strong>: Okay. ’Cause I’d be happy to
explain any of these terms.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lsg board member</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sonny liston</strong>: Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you like
I’s your daddy…</p>
<p><strong>int. a city bus - watching - day</strong>: the back of his
own head moving through a tunnel of white faces, holding his mother’s
hand, passing the balloon faces of nice white passengers, teenagers in
athletic sweaters going to high school, some children, all seated.
MOVING through to the rear of the bus where, standing, are black women,
heavyset with heavy legs, and middle-aged black men with large, rough
hands, crowded on their way to the day’s labor or domestic jobs in the
back of the bus.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: …and those of you who think you came here
to hear us tell you, like these Negro leaders do, that times will get
better and we shall overcome someday, I tell you: you came to the wrong
place.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: ’Cause your times will never get better
until yo make them better. And any of you who think you came here to
hear us tell you to turn the other cheek to the brutality of the white
man and the established system of injustice in this country, to beg for
your place at their lunch counter, I say again! You came to the wrong
place.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: ’Cause we don’t teach you to turn the
other cheek. We don’t teach you to turn the other cheek in the South. We
don’t teach you to turn the other cheek in the North. The Honorable
Elijah Muhammad teaches you, instead, to obey the law. To carry
yourselves in a respectable way. And a proud Afro-American way. But at
the same time…we teach you…that anyone who puts his hand on you? Do your
BEST…to see he doesn’t PUT HIS HAND on any…body…else…AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Yeah. Like that, Daddy. Don’t jump in
one place. Bad for the heart. That’s the most important thing.</p>
<p><strong>int. fifth street gym - cassius</strong>: sits into our
frame, glistening with sweat, directed through tortuous calisthenics by
the hands of Luis Sarria.</p>
<p><strong>int. hampton house club - sam cooke</strong>: drives to the
big climax of “Bring It On Home To Me…!” counter to the limo’s EXTREME
CALM as Sam Cooke’s medley ends and…</p>
<p><strong>cassius/bundini</strong>: Float like a butterfly! Sting like
a bee! Rumble, young man, rumble. Aaaaaaargh!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Sonny Liston: you ain’t no champ! You a
chump! You want to lose your money, bet on Sonny. He know I’m great. He
will go in eight!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: What you lookin’ at, you ugly bear?!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: C’mon, bum. I whup you right here!</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: …210… Cassius Clay weighs 210 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You sure you got that right…?</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: 218. Sonny Liston…the heavyweight champion
of the world weighs 218 pounds…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Pounds of what?!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run
backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C’mon, bear! I
turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man!</p>
<p><strong>sonny liston</strong>: Keep talkin’, punk-ass faggot! I’ll
fuck you up like I’s your daddy…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You whup me, I’ll crawl out of the ring on
my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy cannon</strong>: That a promise?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: …you be the first eatin’ his words!</p>
<p><strong>the doctor</strong>: 210 over 110?! I can’t let him in the
ring in this condition!</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Liston says he’ll talk with his fists.
“Lip from Louisville.” …odds 7:1 against you. Big bet’s whether he’ll
knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether.
You scared of him?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I’m scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston
talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons.</p>
<p><strong>cannon/others</strong>: Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim?
Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: “Black Muslim”’s a press word…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Man’s religion’s his own business.
What kinda question’s that?</p>
<p><strong>reporters/howard cosell</strong>: Does he hate white people?
Malcolm X was in town. Then he left. Was that so he wouldn’t embarrass
you? Liston cannot stand you…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Howard!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: …cannot stand you, Cassius. He really
wants to kill you…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! How
you get that way? When I’m done with Liston, I’m comin’ for you!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It doesn’t come down, I cancel this fight.
You call me in an hour with his blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I’m called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He
was a Jew, too…some other people call me Fastblack…or Daddy Mac…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray Robinson. I
gave my power to Sugar Ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my
magic. Now Shorty sent me to you.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Who Shorty?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I call him Shorty ‘cause he like ’em
circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket,
too. I was born on a doorstep with a note ’cross my chest that read, “Do
the best you can for him, world.” I had to suck the first nipple come
along. I didn’t run away from home…I been runnin’ to home.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin’ them
fights? Else no way you could tell great Archie Moore what round you
droppin’ him in…all of them predictions you make, comin’ true. Never
heard of nobody predictin’ the round like you. You either a phony or
Shorty’s in your corner. Tell me the truth, young man…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: …I study every fight. ‘Til I got a plan.
Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the
p’diction ain’t a p’diction. It’s a plan. And ’cause of all the poppin’
off I do, I know I gotta win! That’s the truth. And why I’m tellin’
you?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: ’Cause I’m gonna be your Inspiration. Your
motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Ain’t spent much time in Miami. Where the
water?</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: 120 over 80? You should be asleep…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: When you get back?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Just now. I’m front row, seat 7.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’m gonna find Mom and Dad.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You could have stayed. Nobody gotta hide
when they with me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Nothing wrong with being cool, my
brother. You been working toward this moment for four years.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: It’s a crusade in modern times. And
television is beaming if off Telstar to the whole world. So Allah has
brought this about for a reason… Salaam alaikum, my brother…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: He was supposed to kill me. Well, I’m still
alive.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: He’s opened a cut on Liston. Liston’s
never been cut!</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, to be on top of your game and to be about
to</strong>: OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns
and sits…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: He’s nothin’ to me…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: And he knows it…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: …my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: My eyes! I can’t see…somethin’ in my
eyes!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Cut ’em off! Cut ’em! I’m blind.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: No. You quit, it’s over! Get out
there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and
run!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: commentary with Les</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Sonny Liston is not coming out! Wait
a minute! Wait a minute! Sonny Liston is not coming out!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: The winner…and the new heavyweight
champion of the world is Cassius Clay!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I upset the world! I am the greatest! I am
the greatest!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Eat your words! Eat your words!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: What made him so easy for you?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I told you. Didn’t I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Was there any single point you knew
you had him?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I had him in the first round. ’Cause I’m
the greatest! Sam… Hey, Sam! Let him up.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I am the greatest! And he the greatest rock
‘n’ roll singer. Sam Cooke! I want everybody to bear witness. I shook up
the world! Don’t have a mark on me! I was burning. I was blind. I’m the
prettiest thing that ever lived. I shook up the world! I shook up the
world!</p>
<p><strong>gordon davidson</strong>: …I don’t care what should have been
ordered! We need a victory party right now. I got national press, the
family, the champ, all kinds of folks… 250 to 300. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Why’s he so scared?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Man, look at that guy run!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: The Mummy! “I can’t get away from the
mummy!” Yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody.</p>
<p><strong>sam cooke</strong>: Hey! The mummy always gets his man…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: No, he don’t! Now, don’t believe that stuff
on television…</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: The people look to you. Do you plan on
being a people’s champ, like Joe Louis?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Yeah. I going to be a people’s champ… But
not like Joe Louis, exactly…</p>
<p><strong>a reporter</strong>: Mr. Clay…?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: And I’m not Clay. Clay’s the name of the
people who owned by ancestors. I don’t want to be called after that
slave name no more. So I’m “X.” Cassius X. And I’m a member of the
Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide.
Malcolm X is my mentor.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: You a card-carrying member? Aren’t Black
Muslims a hate group?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: “Card-carrying”…? Don’t need no “card.” You
got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I’m one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: Minister Malcolm…what about the
reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad?</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: we read his face listening to
Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: This is the champ’s time. And I’m here as
a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I’m going to be a people’s champion. But I
don’t have to be the way you want me to be. I’m gonna be what I want.
And I’m free to think any way I want…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: I was leaving, saw the light on…how come
you’re up?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: …watchin’ a show on termites…they knockin’
down this house, here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: I been invited to speak at Ibadan
University in Nigeria. C’mon with me?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Six million in your house and you don’t
know it. Where?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Africa. You been there?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Africa? No. Only Rome. Yeah, man, let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a
student in New York, so we’ll stop in Ghana…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: When we leaving?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Next Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: You ever been so angry…have you ever been
so angry that you’d explode?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I
was little. Couldn’t take my eyes to it…couldn’t look at it. Barb-wire
around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The
cruelty to it…I couldn’t look at it…couldn’t throw it away.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I thought, “What I do wrong to be so low
that people could do that to people like me?” It made me feel ashamed.
And that makes no sense. But that’s what it was.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: …when I heard about the four girls bombed
in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? The prohibitions of the
Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action.
Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a
place at the white man’s table… But dead children…are dead children. So
the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my
muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg
didn’t work…right arm didn’t work. “I’m having a stroke,” I thought. I
had to hold it in ’cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING!
Break a part…any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a
human being. In your spirit. In your heart… At the death of children.
But I COULD DO…nothing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Everyone knows… Now I’m advocating more
direct political action involvement with the international struggle… So
Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam
for 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You can fix that…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: I don’t know. I will try when we get
back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead.</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Only after long service and high
merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people…is
one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So
there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be
known as Muhammad Ali…which means “one worthy of praise,” and Ali means
“most high.”</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Muhammad Ali. “Worthy of praise…” Thank
you!</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Be very careful what you say…your
words reflect on the nation of Islam, now.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Up until now, I have entrusted your
spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. I do not feel this is a wise
course anymore.</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Malcolm has gone off into the
secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give
you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Herbert will supervise all of your
spiritual and material needs.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: This is a great honor, Messenger…</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Why you want to change?</p>
<p><strong>a neighbor</strong>: Could we get a picture with you? You
mind, Mr. Clay?</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: What’s wrong with the lawyers and
managers you got?</p>
<p><strong>a neighbor</strong>: One more. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Yeah, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: You got…I got you the best white
men I could find. Right here in L’ville…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When the contract run out. I want black lawyers
and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street…</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: They saved you from the
gangsters, from the jackals and the hyenas of boxing. Never cheated you.
Protected you with a trust fund…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t need no “protectin’” from myself. Why I
need protecting from myself by them…?</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: And now I got to go tell them,
“Piss off. Cassius don’t want you around no more.”</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I ain’t one of their thoroughbreds! Or their
charity things. “Let’s do somethin’ for that well-behaved colored boy,
Cassius.” I ain’t well-behaved nothing! I am a man.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And I am not Cassius. I changed my name. I am
Muhammad Ali, now.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: What? What’s wrong with…our name,
my name…? We’re…we made you. We…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No one “made me”…</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: No bow-tie-wearin’, Arab-talkin’
nigger gonna change that…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I made me. No one’s in that ring but me!</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: You don’t know who you are…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I know who I’m not…I’m not drinkin’! Goin’ back
on my wife! I am not prayin’ to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I
ain’t…</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Paintin’ blue-eyed, blonde-haired
Jesuses and signs on cars is what put steak and vegetables in you,
clothes on you…</p>
<p><strong>odessa clay</strong>: …dinner!</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>odessa clay</strong>: You didn’t get it from me…your words,
your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You
got that from your daddy…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You saying I’m just like him?</p>
<p><strong>odessa clay</strong>: I’m saying, if he was your age today,
he’d do the same as you. And he knows that.</p>
<p><strong>one of his children</strong>: Daddy… For you…</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: Brother Malcolm…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: What is it, Joseph?</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name, Muhammad Ali, to Cassius X. Herbert Muhammad’s been
placed in charge of his training, instead of you. Muhammad Ali will not
be traveling with you to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has asked
me to inform you your suspension has been extended indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>betty shabazz</strong>: Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Cassius won’t be coming to Africa…not
with me.</p>
<p><strong>betty shabazz</strong>: Go anyway. Don’t put it off. It’s not
safe here.</p>
<p><strong>one of his children</strong>: Mommy…the bath’s ready…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What
you doin’ up here?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I am…the pilot. He’s the copilot… Here,
Mr. Clay, sit down…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No, man, I meant…in L’ville, when I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.</p>
<p><strong>the pilot</strong>: Here we are. Cote d’Ivoire…Africa.</p>
<p><strong>betty shabazz</strong>: We should think of a name,

<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: And I heard you were coming.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: We just got here now… And, maaan, the brothers
were flyin’ a DC 8. Flippin’ switches, navigatin’, filing flight plans,
talkin’ French…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: When…uh, Liberia. When you fighting
Liston?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: November.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador Huang
Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador from
Algeria.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Man, where should I go? We’re planning on
Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Algeria. See Ben Bella… Go to Mecca,
Medina. I just came back. Made my seven circuits around the Kaaba,
prayed at sunrise… There were two million people…pilgrims from all over.
Dressed all the same, high and low, the same. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed
Muslims. Arabs. Blacks. Yeah. All of them, Muslims praying together.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: It’s Marlin. You’ll never guess who
Malcolm ran into…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Un moment…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Hold on a second…</p>
<p><strong>mobutu’s military aide</strong>: Le Minist�re de D�fense vous

<p><strong>mobutu’s military aide</strong>: The Defense Minister thanks
you.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Il n’y a pas de quoi. Cela m’a fait grand
plaisir. Faites-lui mes compliments.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: It’s nothing. Give him my compliments.</p>
<p><strong>marlin thomas</strong>: Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay.
Muhammad Ali…whatever he calls himself…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I thought that was all over. Is Clay going
to support Malcolm’s U.N. resolution?</p>
<p><strong>marlin thomas</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Find out. We’ll pick up on Malcolm in
Liberia ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Drank from the well of Zem-Zem… And you
should visit Cairo. I have friends there in…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …shouldn’t have quarreled with the Honorable
Elijah…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You shouldn’t have… …quarreled with the
honorable Elijah Muhammad…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You shouldn’t have quarreled with Elijah
Muhammad.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Brother Muhammad…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Brother Muhammad…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sonji…Sonji Roi…</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: What you keep sayin’ my name for?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: ‘Cause I love it, girl. How long you been
workin’ for Herbert?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: ’Bout a year. I sell “Muhammad Speaks” over
the phone…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What kind of name is that?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: My father named me after Sonja Henie.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s your father do?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: He was shot in a poker game when I was two.
He don’t do nothin’. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my
mother died when I was eleven.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So who raised you?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my
own thing…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Whatcha doin’ tomorrow? Go ridin’ with me.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: No. I gotta work, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I square it with Herbert. I got a record player
in my car.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: A record player? C’mon. How come it don’t
skip?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Got springs and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Herbert said you met The Beatles.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. Only one of ’em’s smart…the one with the
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: …he’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: People all screaming and fainting. I asked him,
“This the way they act when you get big?”</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: What he say?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: He said, “Champ. The more real you get, the
more unreal it gonna get.”</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where you live?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: I’m takin’ you there…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I think I gonna keep you around forever,
girl.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Well, I’m not too busy right now, so…I’ll
think on it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Herbert said you weren’t a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Cover my hair? No make-up? Long dresses?
Honey, please. Were you a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: ’Cause you so “gone” off a little good
time.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m no virgin…but I may as well be. I ain’t
jokin’! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a
pretty face for a girl’s face, but you ever seen somethin’ as pretty as
me? Now, you about five-foot-three…that’s too small. But I overlook
that, too, ’cause…</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …’cause of your spirit!</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: My “spirit”…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. ’Cause you too much fun!</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But you gotta be a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Huh? How you do that? Step over a
broom…shazaam…you a Muslim?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Maaan, I ain’t never been with a girl like
you.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Baby, maybe you ain’t ever gonna be with any
other.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That’s right. I wanna marry her.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: You can’t marry that girl! She was a date!
Have some fun! She’s not your wife! You don’t marry this girl. Sign
there. Management papers. My father will kill me.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: True love!</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Watch what you signing, Ali.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You talkin’ to me, or someone walk inna
room, fat boy? Anything’s do to with me I think’s to d-d-do with me…I’m
st-st-still a Christian.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And get me a kosher cook…lady who cooks at
Malcolm’s temple. Put my brother on the payroll. 50g a year for drivin’
and jivin’.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Lana Shabazz…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. How ’bout it, Howard. You be my official
full-time photographer.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: I ain’t goin’ on your payroll. I like it
freelance. Emphasis on “free.”</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Muhammad. She’s not…for you. When I met
her, she was working at a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail on her
backside.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: What were you doin’ down at a cocktail
lounge, Herbert? Sellin’ “Muhammad Peeks”?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Sober up and say something to this man,
Bundini. You supposed to be his “inspiration.”</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I got to know about Sonji, Muhammad. She
got a sister?</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You been s-s-saving it up, training, Champ.
You can’t unleash it on this girl all sudden. You may kill her! Maybe
you should spread it around more before you tie it down.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No. Marriage is the cornerstone of Muslim
life.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Sonji Roi is not a Muslim!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She gonna be a Muslim, now! So fix it up,
Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>martin luther king, jr.</strong>: I fear if this bill is not
passed… …our nation is in for a dark night of social disruption.</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: Why we meeting?</p>
<p><strong>joe smiley</strong>: The idea was…to…make…Malcolm smaller,
you know? Diminished; obscure? Not to turn him into a messiah. What I
got, now, is Malcolm shoulder to shoulder with Martin Luther King. And
Malcolm running all over the world getting Ben Bella and Nasser to
denounce racism in the U.S. while we’re competing over there with the
Soviets.</p>
<p><strong>joe smiley</strong>: Not…a resounding success. We were better
off before, with Malcolm INSIDE the Nation. So… We want you…to get
Elijah Muhammad…to take Malcolm back.</p>
<p><strong>joe smiley</strong>: That’s a joke. I’m kidding! Don’t you
ever smile?</p>
<p><strong>joe smiley</strong>: We’re on a timetable. Malcolm’s pal,
Quaison from Ghana, is introducing Malcolm’s resolution to the General
Assembly in Washington. That’s in five weeks.</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: You got bad breath, man.</p>
<p><strong>joe smiley</strong>: Thyroid. I got a stab wound in 1961.
They took it out. We gotta talk about this guy, too.</p>
<p><strong>joseph 13x</strong>: When do I get my expenses reimbursed…dry
cleaning lots of suits isn’t free…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What you drinkin’?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: What am I drinkin’? Water’s what I’m
drinkin’, champ! I’m a natural man…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s goin’ on? We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: I’m changing my damn clothes! You didn’t like
what I was wearin’!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Come on in…! What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>room service</strong>: What you wanted, isn’t it…a water
glass with vodka…?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: That was before…</p>
<p><strong>room service</strong>: Before what?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Before you showed up…</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: I fine runnin’ around in all these cute short
things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain’t gonna be submissive to
the Brother X’s and what they think. They askin’ me questions alla time
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What questions?!</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: About you and us and I ain’t tellin’ ’em
shit.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: Tell it like it is, sugar! They
took my boy’s name…and what they give him back? Bad style.</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: I don’t drink. I don’t smoke. I converted to
Islam for you and…</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: All except the dress! I ain’t puttin’ no
bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I’m
normal!</p>
<p><strong>daddio</strong>: Hey there, old, aware ones. And you, too, my
fair ones…This is “Daddio’s Jazz Patio.” ON KBCA this fine day, which is
A-okay…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: As-Salaam Alaikum…</p>
<p><strong>the gathered</strong>: Wa-Alaikum-Salaam…</p>
<p><strong>a young man</strong>: What you doin’ in my pockets, man? Get
your hand outta my pocket!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm x</strong>: Hold it, hold it, brothers! Let’s be
cool.</p>
<p><strong>crazy man</strong>: Ambushed!</p>
<p><strong>crazy man</strong>: From the bullet holes, black eagles flew!
They screaming through the streets…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crazy man</strong>: They killed Malcolm…they shot
Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You were the first…you walked me forward, my
brother…you were the first…</p>
<p><strong>sam cooke</strong>: “Been a long, long time comin’, but a
change gonna come, yes it is…”</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: …the arena is surrounded by FBI, the
stands are only half full, the promoter has taken out a million- dollar
insurance policy due to Cassius Clay’s membership in the militant and
radical Black Muslims because of death threats. Oh, and by the way…Sonny
Liston is here, too.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: meets Liston, nails him with a straight right.
Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring,
jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on
his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO…to see Liston
not see it coming.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Liston is down! Scarcely a minute
into the first round, I can’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Get up, sucker! Get up and fight! No one gonna
believe this!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: It’s over; it’s over!</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: You okay? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why you done up like that?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: I’m dyin’ and…‘cause this is how I dress! I
dyin’ for you out of worry…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: “Worry”…?</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Yeah. And all you care about is if I look
dull enough?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: The world looks at me, girl! What if I
straightened my hair, live in the white suburbs? How I am says
something!</p>
<p><strong>sonji</strong>: Well, sorry you don’t like how I am…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where’s Herbert?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What do I do…?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: If you want, have no contact with her for
ninety days. Then you make a public statement of divorce in the mosque,
and Islamic law will be satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: “Satisfied?”…satisfaction is not makin’ it
with the woman who send you to the moon?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Man, I’m the only normal person left around
here and I’m a black Jew who can’t read and is half drunk.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: I gotta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Please stay, Brother Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: He ain’t your brother! Your
brother taking your wife back to Chicago. She’s crying like a widow.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I ain’t dead!</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: You might as well be. You don’t
remember your name or who you are.</p>
<p><strong>cosmetologist</strong>: You got the prettiest eyes…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: He so pretty, when you look up “pretty” in
the dictionary, he too pretty to be there.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: …you gonna try for Germany?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: You gonna try to get stationed in Germany?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Champ. It’s Eskridge…</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: They changed your classification. It’s in the
paper…You’re 1-A. You’re gonna get drafted into the Army…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You know about this?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: Yes. But I think the government’s
looking to negotiate a deal…</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Here we go…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …I flunk their draft board test. Now, without
testing if I am “wiser” or “worser,” they decide I can go into the
Army.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Cassius, it is my opinion you…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And I’m not Cassius Clay. That’s a slave name.
I’m a free man. I’m Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: You know, I apologize to you. On the
air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever
you want.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called
educated man. You really go to law school?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up
a lucrative practice for the likes of you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m the best thing that ever happened to you,
Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in
his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: And without me…you’d be a mouth.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: We’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Have a little coffee with your
sugar…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Keep talking. You were saying something
half-smart…</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: They want to make an example out of
you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why? I’m no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap
Brown…</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: All they are is political. They tell
people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the
WORLD. You’re important. And they don’t like your militancy, your
politics. So, they’ll make an example out of you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …of a good “Ne-gro,” who do what he told?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what
happens to your ass if you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: You do six weeks basic…you go
into the Reserves…you don’t go to Vietnam…you get to box…you even get to
keep the money…</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: The Messenger would not object if you
joined under these terms.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I stay out of jail and I get to fight.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: All you have to do is accept the induction.
And life goes on.</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: They call your name. You say
yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jerome claridge</strong>: …and you will take one step
forward as your name and service are called, and such a step will
constitute your induction into the Armed Force indicated.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jerome claridge</strong>: Cassius Marcellus Clay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jerome claridge</strong>: Mr. Clay, I am required to
inform you that refusal to accept a lawful induction order constitutes a
felony under the Universal Military Training and Service Act, punishable
by up to five years’ imprisonment and a five-thousand-dollar fine. Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jerome claridge</strong>: Cassius Marcellus Clay.</p>
<p><strong>lt. jerome claridge</strong>: Cassius Marcellus Clay.</p>
<p><strong>a man</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Clay,
you’re under arrest for refusing induction…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He’s my
lawyer. No. I’m out on bail. Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I’m an
athlete. Army’s there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that.
No. I never shot anything in my life. Do I know where Vietnam is? Yeah.
It’s on TV… In southeast Asia? It there, too? That’s a joke, man…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What do I think about who? Vietcong?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Man, I ain’t got no quarrel with them
Vietcong.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No Vietcong ever called me nigger.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You know what you j-j-just said…?</p>
<p><strong>lipsyte</strong>: From Europe to China…every home in
America…the world’s gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the
world said about the U.S. war…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So what? I ain’t gonna be what anybody else
want me to be. I’m not afraid to be what I want. And think how I
want.</p>
<p><strong>lipsyte</strong>: Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission
in New York, Cleveland and L.A. But you’re also getting attacked as
unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York
Times and Joe Louis…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: People are following me…</p>
<p><strong>bob arum</strong>: I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight
for you. Plus, I think they’re going to vacate you from the crown.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob arum</strong>: Yeah. If you’re convicted.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They gonna take away what no fighter in the
world can?</p>
<p><strong>bob arum</strong>: And New York may revoke your boxing
license.</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: You sure you want to do all this?
Your next three to four years are every heavyweight’s prime. And there
are few of those years…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What ’bout Terrell?</p>
<p><strong>bob arum</strong>: We’ll know if we can fight Terrell in
Illinois this afternoon. Terrell’s running his mouth. He said if you’re
called, you should serve…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein’ too
tall, or havin’ flat feet. Why don’t he serve for me? Tellin’ me what I
should do…</p>
<p><strong>bob arum</strong>: I got to get you some fights. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>commissioner</strong>: You understand we could take away your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>commissioner</strong>: Are you prepared to apologize? About
your unpatriotic remarks that you made?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Apologize? No.</p>
<p><strong>commissioner</strong>: You said that you were the people’s
champion.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>commissioner</strong>: Do you think you’re acting like the
people’s champion…?!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you.
This isn’t a courtroom. And I don’t have to sit here and answer your
questions.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I ain’t draft dodgin’! I ain’t goin’ to Canada.
I ain’t burnin’ my draft card. I ain’t burnin’ the flag. I’m stayin’
right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I’ll do my time.
I been in jail four hundred years. I’ll be in jail four, five more. But
I ain’t goin’ ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for
you. ’Cause if I’m gonna die, I’ll die now, right here, fighting you. If
I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my
opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my
opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but
you won’t even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs,
you won’t even stand up for me here at home.</p>
<p><strong>ernie terrell</strong>: Tell Clay he can get on after me.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>ernie terrell</strong>: Get on the scale after…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What you call me…?</p>
<p><strong>ernie terrell</strong>: Only thing I knows you as: Cassius
Clay!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Announce it right here or from flat on your
back!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s my name?!?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s my name, motherfucker?!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s my name?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: My name?! WHAT’S MY NAME?!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: If the court would give me my sentence right
now instead of waiting and stalling.</p>
<p><strong>judge ingraham</strong>: My pleasure. The jury has found you
guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I
sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable…five years’ imprisonment
and a fine of ten thousand dollars. Fast enough? Your attorney will
lodge an appeal. While you’re out on bond, I order your passport
surrendered. I’ll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting
abroad…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Watch now…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Blow on it…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: This spooky! Don’t get scared…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: See, you don’t need to fight no more…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So what’s fresh, girl?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Everything fresh!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s the freshest of the freshest?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Doughnuts just came out…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a
wrassler. 645 pounds. I’d still be pretty…but I be fat pretty…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You don’t remember when you met me once
before…long ago…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I remember something… Wha’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You know my name! You came to my school,
right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I
was eleven.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You had a long braid…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Yeah! You called me little Indian girl,
then.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That was you?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I loved you then, like all those kids. I
never stopped. I still do.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You see the Ellis-Quarry fight?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: Yes… We’ll be in front of the
U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We’ll lose. Then we appeal to the
Supreme Court.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin’ on him since we
was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier’ll kill him. Then
they out of juice. Where’s the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight
Ellis in a phone booth…middle of Times Square…you think that draw a
crowd?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd,
Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses.
They don’t want you to fight. ACLU’s handling your case against the New
York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York’s got actual
ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked
yours…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Tijuana?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: No. State Department refused
permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Can’t fight here. Can’t fight outside the
country…</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: I know people in the restaurant
business…want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali’s “Champ
Burger”…“Muhammad Malts,” “Fist Full of Fries”…all of that.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why I want to be in the restaurant
business?!</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: ’Cause you need the money.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How much all this gonna cost?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: Too much. They do that to you,
too, you know.</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey, champ!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Not then…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: First time? 1961…Sister Khalilah introduced
you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world
by the time you were twenty-one!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I always tell the truth…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I was eleven. I interviewed you for the
student paper. You called me “little Indian girl,” ’cause I wore my hair
real long, in a braid…I told you…“Man, you scribble! You can’t even
write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better…”</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “There must be some kind of said the
joker to the thief…”</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “There’s too much confusion, I can’t
get no relief. Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth.”</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “No reason to get excited, the thief,
he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but
a joke.”</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “But you and I, we’ve been and this is
not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it’s getting
late…”</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “All along the watchtower, princes
kept the view, while all the women came and went, barefoot servants,
too.”</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: …struck out at the appellate
level in New Orleans. So we’re heading back to the Supreme Court…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thought we already got turned down there.</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: I’m petitioning on a
conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We’ll petition that
your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I
believe they’ll hear that…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert
tell me I’m runnin’ on empty. Put aside “how do that happen”? Licenses
all revoked. No passport. I can’t fight here. Can’t fight abroad. And
what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?</p>
<p><strong>chauncey eskridge</strong>: It’s all over. You go to jail for
five years.</p>
<p><strong>jimi hendrix</strong>: “Outside in the cold distance, a wild
cat did growl, two riders were approaching, and the wind began to
HOWL!”</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Ellis doesn’t belong in there.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Man give him a shot, he took a shot.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: I saw Bundini in New York.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: How’s he?</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: …bad shape. You better get your belt
b-b-back…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: She’s got to be done with that bottle.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You call your parents, Ali?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: No, he didn’t. I told them about the one on
the way…myself.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You p-p-p-promised you’d call them.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’ll call ’em, I’ll call ’em… May-may! It go in
one end and come out the other.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You wanna try changing her, for the
experience?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You so much better at it, mama.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Maaan…Joe Frazier can’t talk, can’t up the
gate, can’t fill the arena. They gotta let me fight.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: That happen, you promise me you put some
new people around you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie –</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Ali, she’s talkin’ about “Brother”
Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Where are they when we need them? You got
Gene Kilroy droppin’ off groceries like charity. Borrowin’ money from my
folks. So…?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: What are your feelings about up-
and-coming Ken Norton?</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: Norton’s big and strong, but…</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Hold on one second…we have a caller.
Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Cosell? This Muhammad Ali.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Go to Georgia or Alabama or Sweden. Everybody
know I’m the champ. The crown is a lie. I know it’s a lie. Joe Frazier
know it’s a lie. It time for everybody to stop lying and tell the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Let’s tell it like it is. With your
court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I ain’t interested in the paycheck, I’d fight
Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn’t
broke. I still will.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Did you say you were broke? How can
you be broke?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: You’ve made more money than all
previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management?
Surely they have provided for you…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m saying it’s time for everybody to quit
lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I’ll get the fight on
myself. And if they offer me money, I ain’t gonna turn it down.</p>
<p><strong>crosscut</strong>: Elijah turns to an aide.</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Get me my son, Herbert, on the
telephone!</p>
<p><strong>elijah muhammad</strong>: Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that
which the Holy Qur’an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending
Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever.
Furthermore…he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward,
he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Muhammad…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You can’t call me that no more.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Hell, I can’t. I’m defying them by talking
to you. And being with you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Whyn’t you call an ambulance or a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Wouldn’t let me. Said he knew you…and to
call you, Mr. Ali… He’s not been out for three days…</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Bundini!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Watchu’ doin’ here? Gimme that short
dog!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s wrong with you, man?!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Nothin’ wrong with me!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: What that?!!!</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: A mystery…d-d-d-daylight…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I leave you alone. You called me!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: That were a week ago…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What you shame yourself like this for, maaan…?!
Why you shame yourself?!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Lemme alone! I’m flyin’! The Sky Chief talk
through me. I know the word!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You know “low.” You so low, the curb look like
up!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne!
From the root to the fruit…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Those rhymes is old. Forget ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: God don’t care about you! Don’t care about
me! In all of everything, we mean nothin’. He don’t know us. We be. And
that’s the onliest thing he did. And that’s good ’cause that’s why we
free. But free ain’t easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker…
It eats raw meat. It walk in its own shoes. It does not waver… Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I sold your belt for five hundred dollars
to a barber on Lenox Avenue. That’s how low I did you. I’m filled with
weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight
Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm.
That’s what I called to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: …heard ’bout the Nation, all that court
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Forgive me, Muhammad. Take me back…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: No. There’s no “back” to take you to…</p>
<p><strong>reverse: past ali</strong>: The city recedes. Vectors, in
perspective, carry structures, buildings away. The sky is grey, going to
blue. The city flees and SUDDENLY disappears as we race into the dark
tunnel of subway. Ali’s lost in the depths of attempting a calculation.
He can’t do that for which he has a genius beyond other men…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …you can’t do what you do best in the world.
And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids?
And is Allah, is God with me?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: A thousand dollars to the man who brings me
Howard Cosell’s toupee! Dead or alive!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Don’t bother me. I’m a world- famous
broadcaster and you’re an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can’t be
seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Put me on, Howard.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Muhammad, I’d do anything for you.
But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I guarantee…it will be a historical and
momentous night!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I’m
not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain’t
gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight
again…</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: I thought you were resolute in your
resolve to regain your crown…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: If tomorrow they say: “We want you to fight Joe
Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars.
Here’s your license back.” I will tell them: “I am sorry, but I am
done.”</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: What about Frazier?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You’ll have to wonder…what me and Smokin’ Joe
would have looked like.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: You surprise me, Muhammad…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Howard, you losing your hearing along with your
hair? Don’t put questions to it! I am through fighting. ‘Cause I got a
bigger and more important match comin’ up. The U.S. government. A
heavier contender.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Do you think you’re going to
jail?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t know, but it’s going to be a shocking
and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in
boxing.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Joe Frazier told me on this show he
would knock you out.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There you go, agitatin’. You ask Smokin’ Joe
what he been smokin’?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better
wake up and apologize… But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe,
here’s what you might see… Ali comes out to meet Frazier, If Frazier
goes back an inch farther, Ali swings with a left, Ali swings Frazier
keeps backin’, but there’s It a matter of time before Ali Now Ali lands
with a right, what</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: a beautiful swing, out of the ring. referee
wears a frown, Frazier come down. view. And the crowd is getting
frantic. him up. He’s somewhere over the Atlantic. they came to this
fight, launching of a black satellite?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But don’t wait for they fight. ’Cause it ain’t
never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You want me to buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>cassius clay, sr.</strong>: I don’t drink no more. You wanna
fight?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t wanna fight no more. Not with you…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Who dress you, Joe? You look like Dale
Evans.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: Shut up. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: What the hell you in Philly for? Philly my
town.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: To be closer to you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There be two undefeated heavyweight champions!
And they ain’t fighting!</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times.
The Man won’t let you fight no more. What you complainin’ to me for?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: ’Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta
do this.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: We…“gotta” do nothin’!!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You wanna get this on, Joe? You and me? Or
not?!</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: What about your license?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can fight in Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: How’s that? What about the Boxing
Commission?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Georgia ain’t got no state boxing commission.
And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam
something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But
we got to get the steamroller movin’ now.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: What I got to do?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me
the title shot. So what you say…maaan?</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a
slaughterhouse…right on that corner. I came up from nothing. What I got,
I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win
and everything to lose.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But you know you ain’t the champ yet.</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: Yeah…“yet.” All right. You beat Quarry,
I’ll get inna ring and fuck you up…</p>
<p><strong>frazier</strong>: You need any money or anything to tide you
by…?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Weight’s comin’ down. 222.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What you want?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Take me back, boss.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You want me to take you back?</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I’m clean. And you a resurrection. This is
God’s act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up
people gotta be a prophet.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: And the prophet is going home. You the sun.
Let me live in the light. Take me with, boss. …I’ll do anything.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You can’t hit what you can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Float like a butterfly, sting like a
bee.</p>
<p><strong>ali/bundini</strong>: Rumble, young man, rumble!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: You the man! You Superman! Ain’t no
kryptonite in this ring tonight!</p>
<p><strong>close: ali + quarry</strong>: Ali knows Quarry’s anguish.
They embrace. Ali says things to him. And for that moment they are an
island. Ali and Quarry, their arms interlocked, are their own tribe. Two
pugilists, no longer adversarial, a class unto themselves. Then…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: …you don’t need their management…</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: As-Saalam Alaikum…Brother Muhammad…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: All praise to Allah… …Alaikum Salaam…</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: The Messenger has lifted the suspension,
Muhammad. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You saying I can be a Muslim again,
Herbert?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I never stopped. Like I never stopped being
champ.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: I begged my father to reinstate you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I
won it?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: We can get you Frazier.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I already got Frazier.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: We can get you five million dollars for
Frazier.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Are we talking management, talking money or
talking religion?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: When you…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When I got leery and talked up how come I’m
broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my
brother…?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: It’s my father…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I love the Nation, Herbert. I love Elijah
Muhammad. But it don’t own me.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Now, you go on out. And you make the Frazier
deal.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: My brother!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You b-b-becoming a Christian? Forgive and
forget?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Muhammad, you T.K.O.’ed ’em…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: No. “The Supreme Court ruled today in
the case of the United States vs. Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad Ali…”
You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You’re free.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m free.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Supreme Court set me free.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: That’s ’cause they know the king is gonna
go home to his throne. And they know everybody’s with you, now. And they
wanna be on the RIGHT side!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of
boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …the contender and former heavyweight
champion of the world, seeking to regain his title, from Louisville,
Kentucky, Muhammad Ali!!!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And in the opposite corner, the current
heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin’ Joe Frazier…!</p>
<p><strong>ali’s eyes</strong>: deep in his focused concentration. His
attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston
fight…pure purpose.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hook’s comin’. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK
LEGS…!</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Ali was out! He was out on his feet.
Joe almost had him. Frazier must have thought Ali was playing possum.
’Cause Ali’s a clown. Others have come in on Ali when he’s playing
possum and gotten knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Hell of a fight, champ…</p>
<p><strong>hangers-on</strong>: They stole it from you!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Shut up! I lost. Get outta here…</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Go on! Everybody out!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Ferdie, take a look at this… It was
still a hell of a fight.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where’s Belinda?</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: She fainted… They took her to the aid
station. She’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: My hands was in sand, Angie. My feet in
water…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Maybe we shoulda had more time
between Blin and this, you know…to get back into…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Woulda, shoulda, coulda… After three-and-a-half
years, this…from how far back…comeback is.</p>
<p><strong>press</strong>: Were you robbed?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I lost. You lose, you don’t shoot yourself. The
world goes on.</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: Joe said he didn’t think you
wanted to fight him again…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Oh, how wrong he is.</p>
<p><strong>int. madison square garden, aid station - belinda -
night</strong>: sees Ali…the beating. She begins crying.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: My God. They killed you!</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: Get away from her. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I ain’t dead, baby! C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got
me…</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: It’s broke. I think…I think your jaw’s
broke.</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali
snatches Angelo’s hand holding the towel. Angelo’s about to end the
fight…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ain’t stoppin’ nothin’…! Nothin’ stoppin’…!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Now that Smokin’ Joe’s run out of tomato
cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in
about six months. Frazier said he’d be happy with three mil…</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: I’ll fly to Jamaica and get Yank to sign
right after Joe beats this big stiff.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Foreman call me one time after he won the
Olympics…</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: B-b-be easy gettin’ a Frazier fight now. He
ain’t the champ of anything except getting knocked down.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: So we only eked this one out. And
George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy.</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: You see their fight?</p>
<p><strong>howard bingham</strong>: You mean the Joe Frazier falling-
down lesson?</p>
<p><strong>pacheco</strong>: And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I
don’t want to see your head get turned into someone’s bull’s-eye.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: …but, you go? We’re the corner, same
as always. But it ain’t gonna be easy.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You think I still got the tools?</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: You got the tools, Daddy. But they
different.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well, you better sharpen ‘em up. ’Cause we
goin’ to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: The motherland. From the root to the fruit.
We gonna rumble…in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: It’s time to be heavyweight champion of the
world again.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Yeah, man!</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: “Rumble in the Jungle!” That’s the name I
given it.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: A historical happening. This event will
show that the black man has arrived on the world stage. Muhammad Ali and
George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica? What’s
wrong with New York City?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Because you miss the significance. I
dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by
the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men,
overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new
day of liberation…financial and otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: It will raise up the spirit of our inner
cities. It will rise up and fill with hope the souls, the unrequited
needs of the black proletariat, that is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated, denizens of the demimonde, that is called…the ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Man, you crazy.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Ten million dollars. With one stroke of
the pen, you split the world’s biggest emolumation of the history of
sports!</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: The “Rumble in the Jungle”!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What are they saying, man?!!! Why they saying
that?</p>
<p><strong>zairian official #1</strong>: They say, “Ali, boma ye. Ali,
boma ye.”</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s that mean?! I don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>zairian official #1</strong>: It mean…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>zairian official #1</strong>: It mean…“Ali, kill him! Ali,
kill him!”</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ali, boma ye!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ali, boma ye!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and
shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Back up, maaan… …you fast!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Ali, boma ye!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ali, boma ye George Foreman!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You out, sucker!</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: You beat them, Ali!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Foreman? I kill him!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Shazaam!!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter
what…I gotta win.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in
there got me over Foreman? Don’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Some of us…Norman, me…are worried.
How you gonna dance against George?? He’s sparring with a middleweight,
training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you
out with either hand.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s the odds?</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We’re
worried you’re going to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: This’ll be the biggest upset since Sonny
Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no
contest!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: George Foreman is a big mummy. I’ve officially
named him “The Mummy.”</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: George punches are like “Look out, here come
the left.” Whomp! Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But “The
Mummy” can’t hit what it can’t see. I’m fast! Gonna dance. Be all over
George. George is gonna feel he surrounded. And I done somethin’ new for
this fight; I done rassled with an alligator.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That’s right! I have rassled with an alligator.
I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder
in jail. That’s bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone.
Hospitalized a brick. I’m so mean, I make medicine sick.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Muhammad, I’m sorry. I have to ask.
Are you really fast enough, anymore? To beat George Foreman? Many people
believe you don’t have the same skills, that you are not the same man
you used to be ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Howard. I didn’t want to talk about this,
especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she
told me you’re not the man you used to be…two years ago!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Salaam Alaikum, brothers! The champ is
here!</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Here’s your water.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this
stuff like Africans don’t have steaks…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You could pick up parasites…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They eat it.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: You’re seeing what you want to see,
Muhammad…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Mobutu eats it…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and
stealing all the wealth and sending it to Switzerland…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So? What’s that do with any of why we here?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: We’re here ’cause Don King got Mobutu to
put up ten million dollars. Don King don’t give a damn about Africa. He
worse than Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Here come “Herbert.”</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Yeah. ’Cause where was he when we was broke
and borrowing money? And Bundini and all them that “love you”?
Disappeared, is where they were. All over you when you got it and drop
off you when you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Money? I do “money-making” whenever I want.
Money is easy.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: And Don King fit right in…that
double-breasted hipster is now a dashiki-wearing rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Don King delivered the first black- promoted
championship fight in Africa!</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Don King talks black, lives white and
thinks green! Why you defending him and “brother” Herbert?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: ’Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South
Side of Chicago don’t get this done! I got to put honkeys with
connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: And now they got you up against George
Foreman. Do they give a damn you could get killed?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin’
doubt on me?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I think: why is my Muslim husband letting
himself get strung up on a cross…? It means, “tell me.”</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go back to
Chicago and look after her.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I’ll be back before the fight. If that’s
all right, my husband…</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Champ! Champ! George had an accident.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Got cut. Right above his right eye. His
sparring partner’s elbow. Split it open, so…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Can he fight?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Not for six weeks.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: This is not a humorous situation, my
champion. This postponement could be long, especially if George
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Are you tryin’ to pull something,
Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves,
he ain’t comin’ back. George don’t like it here.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: How right you are, my suspicious and short
Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black
promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must
bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some
dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it
be deprived of light and bled of water. ’Cause what gonna bleed…is
money. A hemorrhage of cash. …blood on the floor. Double hotel costs.
Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: What do you expect us to do, Don?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Muhammad. Find a way to get George to
stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right
here, in Egypt, if you’ll pardon my Swahili.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: L-l-l-lingala.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Lingala. They s-s-s-speak Lingala.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: If George goes? You forfeit five
million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain’t promotin’ a charity
raffle…</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: If George goes? George goes, my champion,
I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III…the fight everybody want to
see.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Truth is…George knocked hisself out.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That’s right. He did three rounds. Knew he was
gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that
whenever the fight is set, he might not show up!</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: You bad!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I’m a bad man!</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: Ain’t no doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And you tell the same thing to George.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I been watchin’ you! I heard you. I know he’s
your man. I know you got him picked. But the man’s in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he
ain’t gonna show. That’s why he knocked hisself out when he was
training.</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: We will reschedule the fight, and to
ensure George is ready, we are thinking of postponing from September
24th to October 30th.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What about the concert, Don?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: That would go off as planned on September
22nd and 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private
boats. Private jets. I want the airport – I’m serious – I want President
Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want
all of you “Zaireans” to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin’ to
slip away! They might be takin’ him out.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: The bus station.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything!
Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by elephant.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: What you say?</p>
<p><strong>don king</strong>: I ain’t talkin’ to you!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey!!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Don’t talk to Angelo like that! Don’t you talk
to him like that ever again!!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You think you’re callin’ these shots, Don?
You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They know! All those ladies out there know.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They know I’m ready! I see fear in the eyes of
his followers! I see fear! This is the fight that Muhammad Ali was
supposed to be ended. The myth of Muhammad was supposed to fall!
Supposed to be my destruction! They miscalculated. They misjudged. They
got it…wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Say, girl…!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: C’mere. I know you?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Veronica Porche.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Like the sports car.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But with a little something extra. Veronica, I
know you now. C’mere, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You with Don?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Don brought me here, but I’m not
“with”…anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: L.A. But my people are from Louisiana.
We’re Creole. So I’m African, French, Spanish, my mother’s grandfather
was Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Well…they all came together real nice.</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: You know… …I’m glad you said what you did.
You made sure this fight stays here.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: All them writers in there think Foreman
gonna…kill me! What you think?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Ali, boma ye.</p>
<p><strong>plimpton type</strong>: …she’s an African “succubus.” Means
witch doctor.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Succubus? Suck my dick. They ain’t room in
Africa for more than one witch doctor. And that’s B’dini.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You been to Hong Kong? Taiwan? Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I can’t go there. All the ladies out there from
Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India… “Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad
Al-i-i-i!” You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok – I
couldn’t walk. I couldn’t…I just couldn’t do nothin’. “Get me outta this
country!” The women were so pretty…</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: ’B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?! You know what
I heard?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to
their knees…and they about Veronica’s complexion…and they bad!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: But they ain’t nothin’ like the “sisters.”
Ain’t NOTHIN’ like the sisters!</p>
<p><strong>news cameraman</strong>: Champ…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Let’s go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: So why you glad we still here?</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Holdin’ this in Africa make people proud.
All over the world. They’re proud of you. Anybody can fight in
Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That’s one job. I got two…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …gotta whup George!</p>
<p><strong>veronica</strong>: Islamic faith help you to that?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and
failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! ‘Cause I am
weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow…causing me to be a
lovin’ husband and a terrible husband…! …green eyes and cocoa skin…?
…okay, rest of me, let’s go!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Faster! Faster!</p>
<p><strong>optional</strong>: Ali takes body hits, tries sliding off
head shots.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You can’t lead a right hand. Not at him!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Too long…to get it there. Man, I mean, to
think you could hit him with a right lead…it’s insulting… Nobody would
lead a right…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: I got him! Lock him up.</p>
<p><strong>sadler</strong>: Hey, hold up, chump! Make this chump turn me
loose.</p>
<p><strong>sadler</strong>: This is my wife, Irene…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman’s trainer,
feelin’ me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I’m in shape!</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Can I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: We’ll, you ain’t gonna find no fat! Watch
out!!</p>
<p><strong>sadler</strong>: Give me that thing!</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Muhammad. Give her an Ali button!</p>
<p><strong>sadler</strong>: No, you ain’t. All right, give my wife an
Ali button.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: She’s gotta put it on.</p>
<p><strong>sadler</strong>: Give my wife one.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Bo’dini, you got Ali buttons?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: “George” buttons is all I got. In my bedroom!
All over the bed! Everywhere! To remind me…of all of ya’. All of ya’!
Reminds me of all ya’!</p>
<p><strong>ortf interviewer</strong>: Pardon. Vous �tes de l’ambassade
des Etats-Unis? Vous avez une pr�diction?</p>
<p><strong>ortf interviewer</strong>: Excuse me. You are from the U.S.
Embassy? Do you have a prediction?</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Je suis avec l’Agence am�ricane
d’informations. Il ne m’est pas permis d’exprimer mes pr�f�rences entre
deux citoyens des Etats-Unis.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: I’m with the U.S. Information Agency. I’m
not allowed to take favorites among two United States citizens…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: He gone?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Hello, Muhammad. Bingham. Mr. Cosell.</p>
<p><strong>howard cosell</strong>: Hi…Mrs. Ali.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: When did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Just now. Muhammad, may I have a word with
you, please?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: But I don’t have to have it thrown in my
face. I don’t have to read about it and have people call me up on the
phone about it…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I didn’t mean for it to come out…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no discretion.
You never did. You humiliate me!</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I clean for you. I cook for you. I feel
every punch you take.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Then why you got to be visible with
women?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I didn’t mean for it to be…</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: I live with the casual ones. But this,
this…I can’t hold it together anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t want to hurt you. It’s wrong. You’re a
good wife to me.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Then why do you disrespect me this
way?!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I respect you. I always respect you.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do you love her?</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Do you want to marry her?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I follow my heart.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: “You’re following your heart”? That’s what
you do. No matter what anybody says. Or thinks. Or what it does… And
what happens now?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I fight George. I didn’t come this far to
quit.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: Neither of us did.</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: Belinda?</p>
<p><strong>bingham</strong>: You can’t beat him. You can’t beat him,
’cause you can’t not love him.</p>
<p><strong>mobutu’s military aide</strong>: We are ready, your excellent
President for Life…</p>
<p><strong>mobutu</strong>: Invite Monsieur Idi to join me now… The
Banker? The American?</p>
<p><strong>mobutu’s military aide</strong>: They are waiting in the
sitting room.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant nsakala</strong>: Countdown! Countdown!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Countdown is on, bro. Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thanks to Allah…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant nsakala</strong>: Four minutes!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Give us a moment. Alone. Hey. This is
my religion!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: It’s hot. Humid. Monsoon season’s
about to start. May hit 140 in the ring under the lights. You all
right?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Where you at?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Foreman ain’t no mummy. He’s knocked out eight
out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous
fighter I ever fought.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: I’d worry if I was hearin’ anything
else.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: And I can’t WAIT!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant nsakala</strong>: Three minutes!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Dance. That’s the most important…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Forget every battle of man against man, of
mind against mind, of soul against soul. This is the one. This is the
greatest.</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant nsakala</strong>: Two minutes!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: The prophet’s come back to claim his own!
Get the pretender off that throne!</p>
<p><strong>bundini/ali</strong>: Rumble, young man, rumble! It’s the
“Rumble in the Jungle”!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant nsakala</strong>: One minute!</p>
<p><strong>the people</strong>: Ali! Ali! Boma ye, Ali! Ali! Boma
ye!</p>
<p><strong>the people</strong>: Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma
ye!</p>
<p><strong>another angle: ali</strong>: dances back to his corner…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: George is playing prima donna. He
wants to make you wait.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Foreman! Foreman! Foreman! Foreman!</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Now, both of you know the rules. When I
step back, I want a good, clean break. No hitting below the belt, no
kidney punches, no…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Motherfucker, you ‘bout to discover you ain’t
nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Ali, be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: No kidney punches. Now…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You been hearin’ about me for years. All your
life you been hearin’ about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Ali, I’ll disqualify you. Now, I want a
good, clean, sportsman fight…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You never should have come to Africa.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: All right!! Now go to your corners and come
out fighting when you hear the bell, and may the best man…win…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Legs heavy…air’s heavy…like sand…</p>
<p><strong>slowly move in on ali</strong>: as Angelo and Bundini’s talk
fades away. We see Ali’s awareness in a deep concentration. He is
holding counsel with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal
to the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is weighing
something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it is, he’s decided it NOW.
AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back as Ali’s attention returns to the
present and he ignores…</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: …keep moving. Don’t let him put you
into the corner. Stay off the rope!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: That all you got…? That it?</p>
<p><strong>angelo + bundini</strong>: going crazy in the corner!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes! Dance!</p>
<p><strong>foreman hooks off his jab</strong>: Ali leans back on the top
rope. Foreman’s punch falls short and connects with little effect.
That’s how good is Ali. The techniques BECOME CLEAR.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: There is nothin’… Nothin’! …I cannot take.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Thought you was bad!</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: Dance, dance!</p>
<p><strong>dundee</strong>: Get off the ropes! What are you doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Here come George’s “murder” round.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: George! Show me something.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Where’s your punch, man?!</p>
<p><strong>bundini/dundee</strong>: Ali, get off the ropes! Stick ’em!
Jab! Off the ropes!</p>
<p><strong>dundee/bundini</strong>: Off the ropes! Dance, champ,
dance!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …been here before.</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Ali, move! Dance, champ!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Open the door, Richard…outta this room… Put on
your coat, man…get out…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Think my fight’s over…? That… …all you got?
That the hardest you hit?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: C’mon, chump!!!</p>
<p><strong>angelo dundee</strong>: Get off the goddamn ropes!!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Took somethin’ away from him, Angie, that
round…</p>
<p><strong>bundini</strong>: You gotta move! Stick and MOVE!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: They don’t know what’s happenin’.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You bet the wrong horse! He can’t fight no
better than you can act!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Take it! Terrify him with what you can
take…</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Eight more rounds… You runnin’ outta gas?</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: …can’t let you get that second wind which you
don’t know is out there for you.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Want the title…wear the heavyweight crown? Jaw
broke? Nose smashed? Face busted? You ready to die? Is that you? ’Cause
you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: Now…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo: ali on the left + foreman on the right</strong>: …and
Ali’s left hand is extended way behind him with the wrist bent, no
power. As it passes his body, Ali converts it into a left hook. As he’s
doing this, he’s dropping his left foot back. The left foot DOES NOT
support a left hand. It’s for a right hand so the body can untorque
across with the punch. And Ali is already cocking his right. Meanwhile,
the left connects with Foreman’s jaw and raises his chin. As the left is
departing Foreman’s chin, Ali launches the RIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>int. mobutu’s palace - three men</strong>: waiting, now rise.
One, in Saville Row, is from a London Bank. The other is Bradley, the
USIA/CIA character. The third is Idi Amin of Uganda. As everybody shakes
hands, they sit down and servants appear. Everyone is pleased with
themselves…</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Ce soir, le Zaire a �t� le sujet central
dans le tous les centres europ�ens. F�licitations, Monsieur le Pr�sident
pour la vie.</p>
<p><strong>bradley</strong>: Zaire was the center of the world tonight
in every banking capital, all over Europe. Congratulations, President
for Life.</p>
<p><strong>mobutu</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>london banker</strong>: What’s on the menu…?</p>
<p><strong>int. citroen on kinshasa road - ali - night</strong>: rides
through the downpour with Belinda and Bingham in the front seat. She
gently holds, almost supports his hand.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: I don’t know what’s gonna happen. Maan,
everything is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>belinda</strong>: …I didn’t come this far to quit.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You think you got a chance, chump? Now you in
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: You even dream of beating me? You better wake
up and apologize!</p>
<p><strong>ali</strong>: He too much for me!</p>
