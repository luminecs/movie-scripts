month you’ve slipped deadly nightshade into my tea and run off –</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Three times!</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: You’re mine you know! I made you
with my own hands.</p>

<p><strong>vampire</strong>: I peeked behind the Cyclops’s eye. I did!
But he wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: It’s time to sound the alarms.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Frog’s breath will overpower any odor.
Bitter. Worm’s wart. Where’s that worm’s wart?</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Sally, that soup ready yet?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Coming….lunch</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Ah, what’s that? Worm’s wart, mmm,
and…frog’s breath.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What’s wrong? I-I thought you liked frog’s
breath.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Nothing’s more suspicious than
frog’s breath. Until you taste it I won’t swallow a spoonful.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m not hungry… Oops!</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: You want me to starve. An old man
like me who hardly has strength as it is. Me, to whom you owe your very
life.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh don’t be silly. Mmmm, see.
Scrumptious.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Did anyone think to dredge the lake?</p>
<p><strong>vampire</strong>: Ah, this morning!</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: barks</p>
<p><strong>zero</strong>: barks</p>
<p><strong>vampire</strong>: Zero!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Call a town meeting and I’ll tell everyone all
about it.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Immediately!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting
tonight, town meeting tonight</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen everyone. I want to tell you about
Christmastown.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There are objects so peculiar They were not to
be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It’s a world unlike
anything I’ve ever seen And as hard as I try I can’t seem to describe
Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this
It’s as real as my skull and it does exist Here, let me show you</p>
<p><strong>devil</strong>: A box? is it steel?</p>
<p><strong>werewolf</strong>: Are there locks?</p>
<p><strong>harleouin demon</strong>: Is it filled with a pox?</p>
<p><strong>devil, werewolf, harlequin demon</strong>: A pox How
delightful, a pox</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you please Just a box with bright-colored
paper And the whole thing’s topped with a bow</p>
<p><strong>witches</strong>: A bow? But why? How ugly What’s in it?
What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s the point of the thing, not to know</p>
<p><strong>clown</strong>: It’s a bat Will it bend?</p>
<p><strong>creature under the stairs</strong>: It’s a rat Will it
break?</p>
<p><strong>undersea gal</strong>: Perhaps it s the head that I found in
the lake</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen now, you don’t understand That’s not
the point of Christmas land</p>
<p><strong>mr. hyde</strong>: Oh, yes! Does it still have a foot?</p>
<p><strong>medium mr. hyde</strong>: Let me see, let me look</p>
<p><strong>small mr. hyde</strong>: Is it rotted and covered with
gook?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Um, let me explain There’s no foot inside, but
there’s candy Or sometimes it’s filled with small toys</p>
<p><strong>mummy and winged demon</strong>: Small toys</p>
<p><strong>winged demon</strong>: Do they bite?</p>
<p><strong>mummy</strong>: Do they snap?</p>
<p><strong>winged demon</strong>: Or explode in a sack?</p>
<p><strong>corpse kid</strong>: Or perhaps they just spring out And
scare girls and boys</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What a splendid idea This Christmas sounds
fun I fully endorse it Let’s try it at once</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everyone, please now, not so fast There’s
something here that you don’t quite grasp Well, I may as well give them
what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land Is a fearsome king with a deep
mighty voice Least that’s what I’ve come to understand</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s got to be a logical way to explain
this Xmas thing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: You’ve poisoned me for the last
time you wretched girl.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Oh my head…the door is open.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hel-lo</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Jack Skellington, up here my
boy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Is that so, whatever for?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m conducting a series of experiments.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: How perfectly marvelous. Curiosity
killed the cat, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Come on into the lab and we’ll get
you all fixed up.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hmm. Experiments?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Zero, I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Interesting reaction….but what does it
mean?</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: You can come out now if you promise
to behave. Sally. Sally. Oooh! Gone again!</p>
<p><strong>citizens of halloween</strong>: Something’s up with Jack
Something’s up with Jack Don’t know if we’re ever going to get him
back</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it
let me be? I cannot tell There’s so many things I cannot grasp When I
think I’ve got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Eureka!! This year, Christmas will be
ours!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Patience, everyone. Jack has a special Job
for each of us. Dr. Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.
Dr. Finkelstein to the front of the line.</p>
<p><strong>vampire</strong>: What kind of a noise is that for a baby to
make?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perhaps it can be improved?</p>
<p><strong>vampires</strong>: No problem!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I knew it! Dr. thank you for coming. We need
some of these.</p>
<p><strong>dr. finkelstein</strong>: Hmm.. their construction should be
exceedingly simple. I think.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: How horrible our Xmas will be.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No–how jolly.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Oh, how jolly our Xmas will be. What are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: Jack sent for us.</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Specifically.</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: By name.</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: Lock</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Shock</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: Barrel</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Jack, Jack it’s Oogie’s boys!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah, Halloween’s finest trick or treaters. The
job I have for you is top secret. It requires craft, cunning,
mischief.</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: And we thought you didn’t like us, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Absolutely no one is to know about it. Not a
soul. Now– And one more thing – leave that no account Ooogie Boogie out
of this!</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: Whatever you say, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Of course Jack.</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: Wouldn’t dream of it Jack.</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock, and barrel</strong>: Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: I wanna do it</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: Let’s draw straws</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Jack said we should work together Three of a
kind</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock, and barrel</strong>: Birds of a feather Now and
forever Wheeee La, la, la, la, la</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: First, we’re going to set some bait Inside a
nasty trap and wait When he comes a-sniffing we will Snap the trap and
close the gate</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: Wait! I’ve got a better plan To catch this big
red lobster man Let’s pop him in a boiling pot And when he’s done we’ll
butter him up</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock, and barrel</strong>: Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box Bury him for ninety years Then see if he talks</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man Can take the whole
thing over then He’ll be so pleased, I do declare That he will cook him
rare</p>
<p><strong>lock,shock, and barrel</strong>: Wheeee</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door
And then knock three times And when he answers Sandy Claws will be no
more</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: You’re so stupid, think now lf we blow him up
to smithereens We may lose some pieces And then Jack will beat us black
and green</p>
<p><strong>lock,shock, and barrel</strong>: Kidnap the Sandy Claws Tie
him in a bag Throw him in the ocean Then, see if he is sad</p>
<p><strong>lock and shock</strong>: Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the
meanest guy around If I were on his Boogie list, I’d get out of town</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: He’ll be so pleased by our success That
he’ll reward us too, I’ll bet</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock, and barrel</strong>: Perhaps he’ll make his
special brew Of snake and spider stew Ummm!</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: I wish my cohorts weren’t so dumb</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: I’m not the dumb one</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: You’re no fun</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: Shut up</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: Make me</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: I’ve got something, listen now This one is
real good, you’ll see We’ll send a present to his door Upon there’ll be
a note to read Now, in the box we’ll wait and hide Until his curiosity
entices him to look inside</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: And then we’ll have him One, two, three</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock, and barrel</strong>: Kidnap the Sandy Claws,
beat him with a stick Lock him up for ninety years, see what makes him
tick Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure
to get his kicks Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see Lock him
in a cage and then, throw away the key</p>
<p><strong>oogie boogie</strong>: Sandy Claws..hahaha</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It goes something like this. How about it?
Think you can manage?</p>
<p><strong>person inside bass</strong>: a one, and a two, and a three,
and a. . .</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fantastic! Now why don’t you all practice on
that and we’ll be in great shape. Sally, I need your help more than
anyone’s.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You certainly do, Jack. I had the most
terrible vision.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s splendid.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No, it was about your Xmas. There was smoke
and fire.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That not my Xmas. My Xmas is filled with
laughter and joy and this–my Sandy Claws outfit. I want you to make
it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Jack, please, listen to me–it’s going to be a
disaster.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How could it be–just follow the pattern. This
part is red, the trim is white.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s a mistake, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now don’t be modest, who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy claws outfit.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Next!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I have every confidence in you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: But it seems wrong to me, very wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This device is called a nutcracker.</p>
<p><strong>lock, shock &amp; barrel</strong>: Jack, Jack we caught him
we caught him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s not Sandy Claws!</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: It isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>behemoth</strong>: Bunny!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Not Sandy Claws…take him back!</p>
<p><strong>lock</strong>: We followed your instructions–</p>
<p><strong>barrel</strong>: we went through the door–</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Which door? There’s more than one. Sandy Claws
is behind the door shaped like this.</p>
<p><strong>shock</strong>: I told you!</p>
