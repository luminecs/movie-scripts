<p><strong>hollywood pictures production revision</strong>: 500 South
Buena Vista Burbank, CA 91521 March 17, 1992 560-3370</p>
<p><strong>1 a flash of light 1</strong>: A radiant shiny something
dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP.</p>
<p><strong>begin titles.</strong>: CAMERA very slowly PULLS BACK. The
sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of carats. WE SEE the stone,
then the ring, then suddenly, in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS by. REVEAL
a mechanical claw above the ring, hanging from a crane. The ring sits in
a sea of tiny dolls, joke eyeballs, and other carnival junk. The claw
descends on the ring again and again, sometimes catching it for a moment
then tragically dropping it – accompanied by OOHS and AAHS of hope and
disap- pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man working
the controls. The EYES of a young black woman watching him work. Another
guy’s HANDS digging in his pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the
slot.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: This’ll never work, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Be positive, Armando. Course it will.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look. See what a lucky fuck I am?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He don’t mean the ring, hon, he means
the whole plan.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay – one down, one to go. You got quarters,
Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. florida luxury hotel - day 3</strong>: Palm trees. The
smell of money. Valets in Foreign Legion khakis greeting arriving luxury
cars.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. hotel function room - day 4</strong>: A big crowd of
GUESTS at a cocktail reception. A lot of lime jackets, cherry trousers,
and blue hair. People wear name tags. ON Tommy, in pastel bow tie and
full waiter drag, con- firming orders for a group of guests. He speaks
in a</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s a diet ginger ale, an extra- spicy
virgin mary no salt, a club soda – good choice – a lime rickey, and a
bourbon and a planter’s punch. Five people, five drinks… it’s
Kismet!</p>
<p><strong>5 int. lobby - day - close shot - the ring 5</strong>:
glittering on Loretta’s finger. LORETTA, stunning in designer clothing
and accessories, enters. Her looks attract looks.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. function room - day 6</strong>: Tommy, maintaining his
vantage point, repeats another order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN
ACCENT:</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino, lime and
no ice, a gin Gibson straight up with ex-tra onions – I am also fond of
de onions – and a Chardonnary spritzer…also with extra onions – no, no,
do not worry, that is just a little joke. There will be no onions
whatsoever in your spritzer!</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: You don’t need to write it down?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mr. Memory? Do not make me laugh!</p>
<p><strong>7 int. hallway/entrance to function room - day 7</strong>:
Loretta approaches the function room, where pert DEBBIE, wearing a
JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button, staffs a felt- covered table. On a nearby
easel, a photo of a silver- haired Man with a legend in blue and gold:
JEFF JOHNSON.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’m not too late, am I, dear? Hello,
darling, Alma Preston, how are you today?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Thanks for coming, Ms. Preston, I’m Debbie
Bartle. Do we have your check yet?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: No, honey, I don’t think you do, we just
got in last night from our place in Barbados – how much is it?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Five hundred a person. Barbados?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Yes, we’re just down the beach from Mick
Jagger and Jerry. You wouldn’t turn down a couple of thousand, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Um, that’s a lovely ring.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh, thank you. I thought it might be a
little gaudy…who should I make this out to?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Johnson for Congress. It’s not gaudy, it’s
just…nice and big.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That’s my Carlos…I can’t even look in a
store window. We’re walking down this street in Rio, we pass a jewelry
store…I didn’t even turn my head and he’s in the shop… …$250,000. I said
it’s crazy… but you know Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I wish I did.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bridges</strong>: I hear they had him open for six
hours.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: The sum’ bitch looks terrific.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: How about taking our orders, son?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Absolutely my friend! How can I pleasure
you?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks for
the lady.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ah! Fire and ice! Wonderful! But may I
suggest you make that a double sir? After all, so many guests, so few of
me – who knows when I may be back?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You know where the powder room is, hon? I
should freshen my face before I go in.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: It’s just over there.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: So how the heck are you, Olaf?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: I should be asking how you are,
congressman.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: This old ticker never felt better.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: It’s good to see you back on your feet,
Jeff. We need you in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: How’s that granddaughter of yours,
Olaf? Ready for the Olympics?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: She’ll be thrilled you asked after
her.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: My God! My God! Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: My – my ring. My diamond. I took it off in
the ladies’ room to wash my hands. I was just putting it on – I must
have dropped it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Let me help you, we’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Call Security!</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Hey, what about our drinks?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah? What you want?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: What? You already took our order.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That wasn’t me! You must be thinking of
Jamal. I’m Karim. What you want?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hunh.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, Jeff. Pyramid Insurance
doesn’t want special breaks. I just think we ought to be able to set our
own rates without Uncle Sam sticking his nose in our business.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges, this is
Jennifer, my Administrative Assistant. Zeke’s been a tremendous help to
us. I’d like you to listen to his view on health insurance.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’d be very happy to.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: At Pyramid Insurance, we call our approach the
Patient’s Bill of Rights.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Ms. Preston? Bruno Handler, hotel
security.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: My ring! My ring! Oh my god…!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Now just calm down, Ma’am… can you describe
the ring?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: It’s a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh
my Christ!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I saw it. It’s huge… it must be like eight
carats. She says it was a quarter of a million dollars!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Ma’am… calm down. Now, is the ring
insured?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Of course it’s insured! But you know how it
works – if I report it, they’ll cancel me. And I don’t want another
ring! I need this ring! The ring Carlos gave me.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called for
those dickheads ninety seconds ago.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Now I won’t run through Jeff’s record –
he’s been in Congress twenty years, and I’ve only got two minutes. I’ll
just say this: When those of us in pharmaceuticals, or agribusiness, or
insurance, or utilities, or you name it – when we’ve needed him, Jeff’s
been there for us. And we’ve been there for Jeff, too – we raised a
hundred thousand dollars today!</p>
<p>****: Without further ado, our man in Washington, Jefferson Davis
Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I should be in there. Good luck,
Ms. Preston. I hope you find it.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I can’t go in there like this. God! Please…
listen… I’ll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my
ring. Just don’t tell Carlos! He’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>questioner</strong>: What do you make of all this campaign
reform business, Jeff?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Well, y’know Ernie… these days, everyone’s
down on the political action committees and so-called special interests.
But, heck, I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our
democracy in exactly the way you’re doing today. I’m in Congress to
represent you. I don’t want any so-called reform to take that power away
from you.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I want every heating grate opened and
inspected. I want every air conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you
understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Hey, you! Waiter! Hold it right there!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No! Please! Do not report me! I will be
deported!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Calm down. What’ve you got in your
pocket?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I told the CIA everything! I agreed to poison
the pineapples! My green card is in the mail!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Stow it! I’m not Immigration, I’m hotel
security. Now, what did you just put in your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’m warning you, flathead, get cute with me
and I will tear you a second asshole. Now a valuable diamond ring is
mising…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Valuable?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Very valuable. All right, I’ll give you a
hunnert bucks for it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: A hundred and five?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No! It’s a trick! You will call me a thief
and send me back and the Security Police will make me stand on my head
in the guano pit! I have seen such things on</p>
<p><strong>cnn!</strong>: Bruno snaps and GRABS TOMMY BY THE COLLAR.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Jesus, I’m not trying to trick you…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, no… it is a trap! I must turn this over
to police.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Listen, dipshit… a valuable ring is missing
and there’s thousands of dollars in reward money waiting. So you’d
better fork over…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How big is this… reward?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Um, five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You said ‘thousands.’</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Yeah. Right. A thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, no, no…you said thousands. With an ‘S’.
This is plural. This means “two or more thousands.”</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Okay, you win. Two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Or more. Two or more.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Just making a point.</p>
<p><strong>16 int. hotel room - day 16</strong>: ARMANDO, still
unshaven, answers the RINGING phone.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Hello, may I speak with Ms. Preston?</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: She’s in the bathroom. This is Carlos. Can
I take a message?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: No, thanks, I’ll call back.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Now get back to work!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: This is Bruno in Security. Put me through to
502 – there must be something wrong with the line, I can’t get an
answer… What do you mean, there’s no one in 502? I just spoke to them!…
No one’s registered in 502? Are you sure?… Well, check again!… Shit!</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Hey! Where the hell are our drinks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I remember… you were the sloe gin fizz and
the mango daquiri? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Bourbon neat and a Perrier, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And would you still be wanting the umbrella
then?</p>
<p><strong>17 continued: 17</strong>: As Zeke’s face flushes in anger,
Tommy SEES Bruno come into the room, blood in his eye. Tommy turns
sharply and heads out the terrace doors to the –</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. courtyard - day 18</strong>: Tommy conceals himself
behind a pillar, across the court- yard, away from the Guests. But from
another direction, Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on
a bench by the pillar.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Olaf, there’s something I wanted to sound
you out on. As a special friend.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I’m thinking of retiring from Congress.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I’m thinking maybe I won’t run. Maybe I
should listen more to this. Really appreciate these years. Sail around
the world. Climb mountains. Enjoy the finer things of life.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Jeff. Listen to me. You can’t retire.
Florida needs you. I need you. I need you on rates. I need you on
regulations. I need you on those environmental nutcases –</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Olaf, if I retire this year, I get to keep
all the money left over in my campaign treasury. Comes to a very tidy
nest-egg.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: How tidy?</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: One-point-three million. It’s called the
grandfather loophole.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Come on, Jeff. Look at what you’d be
giving up. Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it
“official business.” Golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking
up a tab. And, Jeff – there’s no aphrodisiac like power. You can have
some of the most intelligent, attractive women in the country. You’ve
got it made!</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Oh, I suppose that one-point-three may seem
like spare change to the head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a country boy
like me –</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Okay, Jeff. I get it. Look. There’s a
little software company that’s about to go through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: A few thousand worth of stock options
would stand to make you quite a pile. As long as your blind trust buys
them, you’re clean – the SEC can’t shake a stick at you. Half a million,
easy – and that’s just a start.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Well, if you put it like that… I now see I
have a duty to continue my career in public service.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m in the wrong business.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. bait shack - day 19</strong>: A ramshackle bait
shack, paint peeling, on the inland waterway. At the rear of the shack,
Armando shoots hoops into a tattered net. Loretta, back in jeans, looks
at her watch. A bondo-patched Econoline van pulls up. Tommy jumps out,
big smile. He gives Loretta an energetic round of</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The best li’l roper in America!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You took your time.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Cops bust you, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Busted? Moi? Fuck no.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That look like busted?</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. capitol - night 20</strong>: Washington, D.C. The
illuminated dome of the Capitol.</p>
<p><strong>21 int. congressional office - night 21</strong>: CAMERA
ROAMS the well-hung walls. From the photos and memorabilia, we realize
that we are in the office of Rep. Jeff Johnson. In the reflections on
the frames, we GLIMPSE some MOVEMENT on the desk explaining the
considerable BREATHING and MOANING .</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my…</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: … God.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>22 int. church - florida - day 22</strong>: The congregation
is SINGING. We SEE the widow Johnson. At her side, in the aisle seat, a
powerful man with bushy eyebrows, about 60, in a three-piece suit and
watch chain: congressman DICK DODGE. The HYMN ends. Dodge steps up to
the pulpit.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It was my honor to serve in Congress with
Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one could have been a better
legislator. No one could have been a finer husband and father. And now
–</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: And now God has called his servant home.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: We will miss him. But we are grateful that
his passing was so peaceful – and so like him – working late into the
night at his desk, the consummate public servant.</p>
<p><strong>22 continued: 22</strong>: Vera sneaks a look at Jennifer,
who is poker-faced.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext./int. veranda/johnson home - day 23</strong>: On the
veranda of the gracious home, mourners pay respects to the family. Dodge
puts a gentle hand on the widow’s shoulder and draws her aside. He
throws a look at Jennifer, who joins them.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Vera, I know you’re still in shock from
Jeff’s… passing. But we have to talk about his seat.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Mrs. Johnson, if you’d like to discuss
this in private –</p>
<p><strong>vera</strong>: You can stay – what’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Vera, I’d like you to announce that you’re
going to run for Congress. Let a few days pass to show proper respect.
But next week, I want to stand next to you at a press conference where
you declare for Jeff’s seat in the House.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: No, Dick – no.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: There’s nothing to be afraid of, Vera. With
your name, you can’t lose. People around these parts are so used to
voting for Jeff Johnson – why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a
walk.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: Dick, I was a Washington wife for
twenty years. Twenty years of Potomac bullshit is plenty for one
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Vera, we’re talking about becoming a Member
of Congress. We’re talking about a sure thing.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t worry about running the office –
I’ll be there night and day.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: I’m sure you would, dear. But I
couldn’t give you the same job satisfaction Jeff gave you.</p>
<p><strong>25 ext. condominum complex - day 25</strong>: A retirement
community in the Florida sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. condo elevator/hallway - day - the elevator doors
26</strong>: open. A supermarket shopping cart full of groceries, tied
with a big bow, rolls out, pushed by Tommy. Loretta accompanies him.
Tommy BUZZES at a door. It’s answered by Tommy’s GRANDMA, a limber lady
in leggings and a bright top. She sees the groceries, kisses him.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: This is very sweet of you, darling. But you
shouldn’t have done it. Where did you get the money?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. grandma’s condo - day 27</strong>: Tommy and Loretta
are watching the track results on the local tv news. Tommy, playing
solitaire, shuffles bril- liantly. Grandma comes in from the kitchen,
shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: How did I end up with a thief for a
grandson?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Grandma – I told you. I’m not a thief. I’m a
con man. An artist.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: But also a crook.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But I only con crooks, Grandma. You can’t con
an honest man. Only somebody who wants something for nothing. But the
good Lord must have been fond of pigeons, because he made so many of
them.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Sometimes I just wish you were more like
your Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You mean, dead?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: No, smartmouth… I mean someone who made
something of himself.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: LOOK…it’s the ad!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I am Inga. I’m here from Sweden and I’m
s-o-o lonely. I need a man…and so do my girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: …Maria, my hotblooded Spanish
friend…Babette, the Parisian pussycat…and many others. So call the
“Girls of Many Nations,” at 1-900-555-NATO.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: So what do you think of my accent,
Grandma?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Compared to what? Loretta, why don’t you go
baste the turkey?</p>
<p><strong>27 continued: 27</strong>: Loretta gets up and goes for the
kitchen. We hear a high-pitched ELECTRONIC WARBLE. Tommy reaches into
Loretta’s purse and pulls out a cellular phone.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: See? I told you TV advertising works.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hello…you have reached Girls of Many Nations.
For Hot Blooded Italian Wildcats, press “one” now. For Perky American
Cheerleaders, press “two” now. For a Sultry Swedish Love Goddess, press
“three” now…</p>
<p>****: He covers the mouthpiece and calls to Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Bingo! Loretta…guy wants to speak to
Inga.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Tell him to call back. I’m basting.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ja, this is Inga. Hello Paul… how are you
tonight? You are feeling naughty? That’s all right …you have your what
in a bowl of oatmeal? Yes, that is very naughty, and maybe a little
sick.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh NO! It’s my husband Lars. He’s home early,
I must go before …you want to talk to Lars too? So you like to talk
dirty out of both sides of your mouth. Man, you are one twisted
bastard!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Tommy, please!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sorry, grandma, just getting a third minute
out of him.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You hung up on Paul? He’s one of my best
customers.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I can’t believe any relative of mine does
that for a living.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: C’mon Gramma…it’s only my voice. They never
actually meet me.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: So my granddaughter talks dirty for a
living and my grandson’s a thief.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s up, Grandma? Are you embarrassed to
show my picture around the pool?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Of course I’m not. Look.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: It spells out Tommy’s full name: Thomas
Jefferson Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Look what these arthritic hands been
doing.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Make me proud of you, Tommy. Make me proud
of the name you carry.</p>
<p><strong>general manager</strong>: I’m Ned Grable, vice president and
general manager of WFLA. We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right thing
in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband’s
death.</p>
<p><strong>general manager</strong>: Jeff Johnson’s name may still be
magic. But it’ll take more than the magic of name recognition to solve
our region’s problems. I’m Ned Grable.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Name recognition. Lordy, what a notion.
People have to be some boobs just to vote for someone because their name
is Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I remember once back in Georgia, they even
elected a dead man. His name was still on the ballot – people were just
used to voting for him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What did you say, Grandma?</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. bait shack - day 28</strong>: HOMER, the proprietor
of Homer’s Pit Stop, wearing fuel- smeared overalls, is dieseling a
Customer’s boat down by the water.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Homer! Get your ass over here!</p>
<p><strong>28 continued: 28</strong>: Up by the racks of junk food and
beer, and pails of fish slop, Tommy and Armando await Homer. In b.g., an
older black gentleman plays checkers, solo. This is VAN DYKE.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: What’s this about, jefe?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Loretta! Get off the damn phone!</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: This better be good.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “This better be good.” Loretta!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh, ya, ya, God, you’re so big! Uh-oh, I
have to go now, my husband Sven is home early…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Goddammit, Inga, is it that pervert again!
Damn!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen, you little shit – I just spent eight
years in the joint, nobody talks to my woman like that! I got your
adress, I got a machete, I got two Rotweilers… I’m gonna come to your
house and tear your ass up!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Okay, Tommy, what’s so damn important?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah, I got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>28 continued: 28</strong>: They all look at him expectantly.
He takes a dramatic pause, then launches into a “Come to Jesus”
speech.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: My friends, I want to tell you about a town
where the streets are paved with gold. This is a town where the marks
give you money before you ask. A town where they take you to dinner
after you fuck ’em. A town where when they need money, they just print
more. This is a town where a guy bounced nine hundred checks and he
didn’t even have to skip town!!!</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Ain’t no town like that.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You mean Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No. Washington, D.C. I’m going to run for
Congress.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: What is this, a joke?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: What’s the con, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Van Dyke. You remember Willie Sutton?</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Of blessed memory.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You remember what he said? They asked him,
Why do you rob banks? And he said, That’s where the money is. I tell
you, people – Washington. That’s where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>28 continued: 28</strong>: Tommy produces a sheaf of Xeroxes
and pamphlets.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I found this shit in the library. You know
how much a congressman makes? A hundred and thirty a year – and that’s
just base pay for getting your ass elected. Then there are these things
called PACs, and these lobbyists, whose whole point in life is to buy
you off. It’s the con of a lifetime – and the damn thing is, it’s legal!
This is hot, people, we can do this!</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Who “we,” white man?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You never heard of staff, Armando? I get in,
I get a staff allowance of five hundred and thirty-seven grand a year
–</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: – which I will generously share with you.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: And how exactly were you going to get your
butt to Congress?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah – why would anyone vote for you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not for me, Homer. For Jeff Johnson. Name
recognition – that’s what it’s all about. You think folks know their
congressman died? I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson, I guarantee
they’ll vote for me. Now all’s I have to do is get on the ballot.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Which is how?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Which is where you folks come in. All’s we
have to do is collect five thousand six hundred twenty five
signatures.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: You shittin’ us?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: In your dreams, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You people got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. silver foxes chapter - day 29</strong>: Senior
citizens fold brochures, stuff envelopes, make phone calls. Van Dyke and
Tommy enter.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay… gimme the four-one-one on these Silver
Foxes Again. It’s a bunch of old folks who like to vote?</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Don’t laugh, they get an enormous turnout.
But the big thing is, they have their own line on the ballot. They
already got the signatures.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: The lady we’re meeting, Hattie Rifkin,
they call her the condo queen.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So all I have to do is snow one old lady.
Don’t sound like major surgery.</p>
<p><strong>30 int. inner office - silver foxes - day 30</strong>: Tommy
and Van Dyke are seated opposite HATTIE RIFKIN, a high-energy woman,
70s, with a frizz of white curls.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: So, what brings you here? You want to talk
politics… talk!</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: We were wondering who you were going to
run for Congress this year.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Oh, the usual sacrifical lamb. Probably
Sylvia Roland. She just lost her husband, she needs to meet new people.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mrs. Rifkin… I want to run.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Well, I want to run too – but with this
plastic hip, it’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What I mean is… I’d like to run for Congress
on the Silver Fox ticket. I care about you and your issues.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Yeah, that’s what my son says. But does he
call? Anyway, what makes you think a group of alter cockers are gonna
support a man who hasn’t clipped his first nose hair yet?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Because I can win.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: No, no… a Democrat can win. A Republican can
win. A Silver Fox can only make a symbolic point.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mrs. RIfkin, if you give me a ballot line,
and if I can get support from…</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: If… if. Ven die bubbah halla tsehen
qulishkes, het gehaya zadeh.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sure, but… besser die viller ein der
kenner.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She said, ‘If my grandmother had balls, she’d
be my grandfather.’</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Where the Hell did you learn to speak
Yiddish?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The same place I learned to hustle shtarkers
at gin rummy. From Morris Elfbein… the Gin King of Miami Beach.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: No kidding… you knew the Rudolf Valentino of
Dade County?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He taught me a great deal. He taught me you
don’t always need the best cards to win.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Maybe not in gin, but in politics, young
man, you need money to win, you need a name to win, you…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, I have a name.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: What, you’re an athlete, a movie star? I
don’t get out as much as I used to. You’re not on MTV, are you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No ma’am. My name is Johnson. Jeff Johnson.
The Name You Know.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: She ponders for a minute. And then
she gets it. A wicked smile.</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Jeff Johnson. Well, that’s a name even our
Alzheimer’s Group will remember. Still, for a full-up campaign, we’d
need materials, we’d need ads…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You leave that to me, Mrs. R.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: I’m not sure I understand, Professor
Franklin – you wrote your doctoral thesis on my husband?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He was a great man, Mrs. Johnson. He did so
much for my people.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: He… did?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, yes. I’ll never forget when he said
‘Welfare is a drug – and you gotta kick it cold turkey.’ It was…
inspirational.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: Really… well, I’m sure…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And I was actually in the audience when he
said, ‘If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for
work, this country might be fit to live in again.’ Powerful stuff.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: It’s very kind of you to say so. And
you’re very kind to come all the way from… where was it?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wilson-Pickett State Teachers College. But I
didn’t just come to pay respects, ma’am. I came because your husband
deserves an archive. A place where scholars can study his legacy. A
storehouse for the record of his remarkable career.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: I see. So you want… his papers?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, not just his papers, Mrs. Johnson.
Everything. Buttons, posters, bumper stickers. All the paraphernalia of
his campaigns – proof of his political genius. Now I realize that you
may have a sentimental attachment to a few items…</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: Take ’em.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: Take ’em all. Would you like the
wedding photos, too?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, I don’t think that’s necess…</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: Good – that way you won’t have to go
rooting around in the garbage. Is there anything else?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, um… no.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: More tea? Or something stronger? I
know it’s only ten-thirty, but, hell, sun’s over the yardarm somewhere,
right?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Actually, ma’am, I should be getting
back.</p>
<p><strong>vera johnson</strong>: You’re in pretty good shape for a
professor. D’you work out?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look, I, um, have a class to teach. You know
how blind students are… they’re so dependent. Don’t worry ma’am… your
materials will be in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. wharf - day - close angle - a scissors 32</strong>:
cuts the RE- off a RE-ELECT JEFF JOHNSON bumper sticker in familiar blue
and gold. Van Dyke, Armando, and Homer have a production line going,
doctoring the old Johnson campaign materials, slicing off and painting
out the RE-’s and the years.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want to come to
Washington with us, Homer?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You bums got time on your hands. I got a
business to run.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hello? Who? The League of Women Voters?
Sorry, Mr. Johnson won’t be attending the debate. No – no, Betty, I’m
sorry, I can’t tie up this line. Hello? The Sarasota Star-Ledger? I’m
sorry, we’re out of photographs. No, you can’t, Mr. Johnson has just had
surgery for a deviated septum. Hello? Ya, this is Inga.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re not going to show you Jeff Johnson
waving a flag. We’re not going to show you Jeff Johnson kissing babies.
We’re not going to show you Jeff Johnson doing anything, because you
already know what Jeff Johnson can do.</p>
<p><strong>33 int. johnson home - night - on tv screen 33</strong>: The
poster fills the screen.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tomorrow, vote for Jeff Johnson. The name you
know.</p>
<p><strong>34 series of shots - night 34</strong>: The congressional
district sleeps. But in the darkness, a kind of D-Day onslaught is under
way. QUICK SUPER- IMPOSED CUTS of Tommy’s secret army of Silver Foxes,
opening crates, fanning through parking lots, swarming over lawns,
driving in stakes, tacking up posters everywhere. INCLUDE Tommy climbing
a telephone pole… Armando shinnying up a light pole across the street…
Loretta and Van Dyke pulling on a rope… which hoists a huge bundle to
Tommy… who opens and unfolds it… and gets an end through the air to
Armando. They unfurl the biggest banner imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. commercial street - dawn 35</strong>: CAMERA TILTS
DOWN. Every square inch of town seems to have been plastered with
JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS material. It’s on billboards, bumpers, bus
shelters, balloons, banners, utility poles… all in the late
congressman’s signature design.</p>
<p><strong>36 quick series of shots - day 36</strong>: The Econoline,
now a JOHNSON ad on wheels, ghetto-blasters mounted front and back on
the roof, rolls by a Jewish deli …a soul food joint… a whitebread
country club… a Chinese restaurant… At each, Tommy’s amplified VOICE
says:</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Jeff Johnson. The name you know.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. elementary school - day 37</strong>: In front of a
polling place, Van Dyke pulls up in a hearse with an ELECT JOHNSON
banner. So, driving muscle cars, do Armando, Homer, and Loretta –
Tommy’s get-out-the-vote fleet. Exhilarated senior citizens pile out,
led by Hattie.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. polling place - day 38</strong>: An ordinary Couple,
40s, sign the registration book, then enter adjacent voting carrels.
After a moment, the HUSBAND leans out.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Who are we voting for Congress?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Don’t we always vote for Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: That’s it – Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>39 video 39</strong>: A NETWORK ANCHOR at an election-night
news set.</p>
<p><strong>network anchor</strong>: If you’re just joining us, our exit
polls project that in Florida, an unknown, independent candidate whose
sole asset appears to be his name may just possibly win a slim
victory.</p>
<p><strong>40 omitted 40</strong>: thru thru 42 42</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. bait shack - night 43</strong>: Blinding lights.
Media circus. TV power cords, a huge tangle snaking back toward mobile
generators. Cameramen narrowly miss knocking each other into the water.
A STEEL DRUM BAND plays “Happy Days Are Here Again.”</p>
<p><strong>43 continued: 43</strong>: The small crowd – Tommy’s cronies,
their pals, and a jubilant contingent of Panthers led by Hattie – lets
out a great WHOOP.</p>
<p><strong>florida reporter #1</strong>: Is that him? Tricia, I believe
Congressman-elect Johnson is coming this way.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Jesus – he’s not… white. I actually voted
for the guy. I thought he was Jeff Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thank you, thank you, all of you, for your
help. Give yourself a round of applause.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I’ve never been so proud in all my life. He
was always such a good boy…well, I think he meant well. Sometimes – well
he was a clean child. That’s important, I think…</p>
<p><strong>florida reporter #2</strong>: Then in Massachusetts, there
was a guy named Kennedy who got elected, but he wasn’t really a
Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>florida reporter #3</strong>: A lot of dead incumbents get
re-elected, actually. It’s an American tradition.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We ran a positive campaign. We campaigned on
the issues. The issue is leadership. Leadership for the future. Ask not
what you can do for your country. The people have spoken. The only thing
we have to fear is fear itself. If you can’t stand the heat stay out of
the kitchen. Live Free or Die. And in conclusion…read my lips!</p>
<p><strong>44 int. airplane - day 44</strong>: Tommy looking out the
window at the city below.</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. washington, d.c. - aerial view - day - 45</strong>:
The approach to National Airport gives a good view of Washington and its
landmarks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The promised land.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. national airport - day 47</strong>: Through the
airport move our Floridians. They look like they’re going to opening day
at the track.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Congressman Johnson! Congressman Johnson!</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Arthur Reinhardt. You remember me – I
Fed-Exed that material to you in Key West?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Reinhardt, my man! Of course! You look just
like I pictured you. Nice wing tips.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Thank you. Congressman, I hope you don’t
think I’m out of line for meeting you here – I thought you might want
some help with logistics, settling in at your hotel – Since you didn’t
make it to the Harvard seminar, I put together a set of their papers for
you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I like your initiative, Reinhardt, but to
tell you the truth, I’ve never been much of a student. Maybe you can
brief my staff sometime.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But thank you, I will take you up on those
logistics. Hey! Entourage! What hotel we at?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Reinhardt, it appears that the staff has
neglected to nail down some details.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Oh, Jesus, the IMF’s in town. Where are
we going to find a room?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Four rooms.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. airport bar - day 49</strong>: The entourage is
enjoying a round of libations. Reinhardt runs up.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: I got lucky at the Madison. Thank god
there’s been a coup in Uruguay. Their delegation just checked out.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re a wizard, Reinhardt. I knew you could
handle it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So when does the House open for business?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Say, Congressman, you got my resume,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m sure I did.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: There’s something I wanted to ask you. I
know it’s a big step, but – I’d like you to consider me to be your
AA.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s quite an offer, Reinhardt, very decent
of you, but I’m just a social drinker.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: No. AA. Your Administrative Assistant. I
worked for Congressman Johnson. I’d like to work for you, Congressman
Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You mean like an affirmative action
thing?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tell you what – I’ll think about it,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thanks for getting us settled, really
appreciate it. Madison Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. memorial bridge - magic hour 52</strong>: The bridge
over the Potomac has a classic view of the Lincoln Memorial and the
Washington Monument. Their taxi drives by.</p>
<p><strong>53 omitted 53</strong>: &amp; &amp; 54 54</p>
<p><strong>55 ext. cannon building - day 55</strong>: Morning. Tommy and
cronies get out of a cab and bound up the grand flight of stairs. In
b.g., the Capitol dome.</p>
<p><strong>56 int. cannon ground floor corridor/elevator - day
56</strong>: They walk the superb ground floor corridor of Cannon,
salivating. Marble columns… chandeliers… grand offices. Real class. AT
AN ELEVATOR with a sign above it – MEMBERS ONLY – they stop. Tommy
presses the button. The door opens. The seated ATTENDANT gets a load of
this group. Especially Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Sorry, folks, this elevator’s for Members
only.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s okay, they’re with me. Sixth floor
please. Cannon 609. I’m going to my office.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I said Members only.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I am a Member. Now take us to six before I
haul your ass in front of the committee on disrespectful behavior.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Elevator don’t go to six. You have to get
off at five and walk.</p>
<p><strong>57 int. cannon stairwell - day 57</strong>: Looking puzzled,
they make their way up a drab stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. cannon top floor - day 58</strong>: Not classy. On
one side of the hallway, the windows give out on a brutally ugly
courtyard. On the other side of the hall are cages: windowless storage
bins behind metal fences crammed with junk – and an occasional xerox
machine, Mr. Coffee, and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk. Tommy opens the
door to 609.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. tommy’s reception area - day 59</strong>: Tommy’s
office is a small, dark garret, with dirty car- peting, bare shelves,
and a pile of bulging canvas U.S. Mail bags.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. tommy’s office - day 60</strong>: Equally
unattractive. Perched on the desk: Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You again!</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Good morning, congressman.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is this shithole?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Oh – you missed the freshman lottery for
offices. They assign them by draw. You didn’t show for the draw, so you
got the worst office in Congress.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I missed what lottery?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: It was all in the briefing books I mailed
you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What else did I miss, Reinhardt?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Are you hiring me, congressman?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re shaking me down, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I haven’t been
here five minutes, and you’re shaking me down. God, I’m gonna love this
town. You’re hired, man. Just tell me what to do next. I don’t want to
miss out on any of the good shit.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: The dinner for new Members is tonight, at
Union Station. Do you have black tie?</p>
<p><strong>61 int. union station - main hall - night 61</strong>: With
its hundred-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and grand windows, the
magnificent Beaux-Arts station has been beautifully restored.</p>
<p><strong>61 continued: 61</strong>: A big crowd slowly makes its way
along a red carpet to the party. Tommy was born to wear a tux. In his
lapel, a red-and- gold eagle pin. On his arm, Loretta, in a dramatic
shoulderless and nearly backless gown, with three-quarter gloves. The
other Women in sight are far more conserva- tively dressed.</p>
<p><strong>62 int. union station - adirondacks restaurant - night
62</strong>: A STRING QUARTET provides the music. Tommy and Loretta
linger uncertainly near the entrance. Then:</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let’s meet some natives.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy Johnson, how’d you do, nice party, heck
of a railroad station, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Rafe Simon, freshman from Tulsa. And this is
Bo Chandler –</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: – from Lufkin, Texas. You must be the one who
didn’t come to Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, I couldn’t, it was my Princeton
reunion….</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Jeff Johnson? You’re Jeff Johnson? The guy
from Florida?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: The rest of us are out there on the campaign
trail, raising money, kissing ass, making speeches, dragging our butts
from place to place – and he slides in on pure name recognition!</p>
<p><strong>62 continued: 62</strong>: He puts his face close to
Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Let me tell you something, Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Fuckin’ brilliant. Thank you. Thank you both
very much. Isn’t that nice, now, don’t you think? This is Miss Loretta,
boys.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How do yo do. How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And it’s Tommy. My friends call me Tommy.
“Jeff” is my… professional name. So what line of work were you boys in
before you got elected? You lawyers or something?</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Oh, no, I did morning weather and traffic for
KTOK in Tulsa.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: You don’t remember me? I was a tight end for the
Oilers – my knee gimped out.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Hey, stop by my reception after the swearing in
tomorrow, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Yeah, but don’t you go to his reception before
you go to my reception.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fine, but I’m gonna be real offended if
either of you miss my reception.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I think we have to have a reception.</p>
<p><strong>first member</strong>: So then I ran an ad calling him a
draft dodger, but then he ran an ad calling me a plagiarist.</p>
<p><strong>second member</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>first member</strong>: Oh, leaked a rumor that his father-
in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten points in a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re in the majors, doll.</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: Congressman? I’d like to introduce myself.
Ken Korngold. National Distilled Spirits Association.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits, is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: It’s super that you won, congressman. Any
way we can help, please don’t hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Pleasure’s all mine, Ken, hope you can make
it to my reception. Do you happen to have a card?</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: I sure do.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. union station - men’s room - night 63</strong>: Tommy
is along a wall where other guests are similarly occupied.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You now what I love about this place? The way
everyone calls you a Member. Every time I hear that, it makes me think
of Mr. Happy here.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t you be peeing on my shoe.</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: Mike Strangland. Iowa – first CD.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You got a CD? Shit, I missed that, too.</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: First Congressional district.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida. So Iowa – how’d
you get to Washington? You do the crop report on tv?</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: No – I owe it all to the Vietnamese.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: War hero?</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids, I
spent so many years telling the Rotary Club what was wrong in
Washington, they finally told me to put up or shut up – so I put up. And
here I am.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait a minute. What’s wrong in
Washington?</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: C’mon – there’s acid rain killing fish, and no
one’s stopping it… there’s topsoil washing away, and no erosion program…
there’s chemicals in our livestock – God, I sound like a Boy Scout.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s alright, Iowa – this place could use a
few geeks like you.</p>
<p><strong>table - night</strong>: Tommy shakes hands around the table,
taking business cards as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>first lobbyist</strong>: Pete Slocum. Asbestos Information
Institute.</p>
<p><strong>second lobbyist</strong>: Mike Gustofson. Freedom to
Advertise Coalition.</p>
<p><strong>third lobbyist</strong>: Paul Zeckhauser. American Tobacco
Council.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey… thank you… nice to see you… hope you can
make it to my reception. Have y’all met Miss Loretta?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Tommy O’Connor. Soon as I saw how you got
elected, I knew you were a real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf Andersen
voted for you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who’s Olaf Andersen?</p>
<p><strong>64 continued: 64</strong>: O’Connor points. ON THE DAIS,
Andersen is engrossed with Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: I won’t tell him you asked. Chairman of
Gulf Coast Power. Constituent of yours, client of mine.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Pays the rent, know what I mean? Say,
could I host a little welcome- to-Washington thing for you down at my
law firm? Meet some of my clients, five hundred a head – you could pick
up twenty, twenty-five grand to get you started.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And how much of that do you get?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Oh, it doesn’t come off the top. Down the
road, I’ll bill ’em each five hundred an hour whenever I take you to
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy, I think this is the beginning of a
beautiful relationship.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Tonight we unite the two great pillars of our
system – political and financial. To the forty-four newly-elected
Members of Congress, I say, Look around you tonight. Look around, and be
thankful for the generosity.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The people you see not only provided
tonight’s hospitality. They are the people you serve. That’s our system
of checks and balances at its best. Their support helped get you
elected… your work will help them… and their support will help you in
your next campaign, which I remind you is already less than two years
away.</p>
<p><strong>66 int./ext. adirondacks - large doors - night 66</strong>:
In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave, they pass Dick
Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests. He stops them.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You know, Mr. Johnson, it’s customary for new
Members to pay a courtesy call on the old fogies in the leadership.
Especially from their HOME STATE.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, I would have, but I just got to town.
It’s an honor to meet you, sir. A real privilege. This is Miss
Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Public liaison.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: How do you do? You could make up for it by
having a nightcap with me. May I have my car take you home?</p>
<p><strong>67 ext. capitol hill - night 67</strong>: Tommy and Dodge
walk up steps toward the Capitol.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. hallway - capitol - night 68</strong>: A darkened
hallway. A hand-lettered sign by a door reads</p>
<p><strong>committee on power and industry. the chairman. mr.</strong>:
DODGE. Tommy and Dodge approach. As Dodge unlocks the door:</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but this ain’t no
homo shit we up to, is it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No. No, it’s not. But – Good thinking,
Johnson. I’m impressed by your instincts.</p>
<p><strong>69 int. dodge’s office - capitol - night 69</strong>: A
single table lamp lights Dick Dodge’s office, reflecting off the velvet
drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are
in leather armchairs, ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle
of Jim Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come to
Washington?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well… of course… it’s a chance to do
something for my country. I mean, there’s the topsoil thing, and acid
rain is killing the cattle –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how you got
elected. Flukes like you are either nutcases or troublemakers. I just
want to know which one I have on my hands. Who sent you here?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No one sent me.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You pulled off that upset on your own?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Kid’s got his talents.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m impressed, Johnson, I am. But why did you
run for Congress?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Opportunity knocks. This town is the fuckin’
Yukon.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What a refreshing answer.</p>
<p><strong>70 ext. cannon - day 70</strong>: Shining in the bright
sun.</p>
<p><strong>71 int. tommy’s office - day - on tommy’s desk 71</strong>:
Hundreds of business cards. An expert riffle, a one- handed cut, and
Tommy deals lightning fast, a perfect diamond formation with two cards
in the middle. He turns them over one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Food… drinks.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Ken Korngold, National Distilled Spirits
Association. Bob Rafferty …Wisconsin Cheese Board. What do you want me
to do?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re on cheese. I’ll handle booze.</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. distiller’s building - day 72</strong>: Pan from
Capitol Hill to gleaming glass office building.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ken! Ken Korngold! Tommy Johnson here… Right
– last night. How’s it going, big guy?</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: Congressman!</p>
<p><strong>73 int. korngold’s office - day 73</strong>: Expensive
furniture, rugs, and art.</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: How are you on this helluva fine day! I’m
looking forward to your reception.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Actually, that’s why I’m calling, Ken. You
said if I needed some help –</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: You name it, congressman. Issue papers,
testimony, floor speeches –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tell you what I have in mind. I was just
thinking, wouldn’t it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to – how
should I put this – showcase some of his distillers’ products at my
reception? You know, like they put Reese’s pieces in E.T.? It’s called
“product placement.” People come in, they have a tremendous time, they
see your products, they think well of you – and they think well of me,
too. It’s good for both of us, Ken. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>korngold</strong>: Well, it’s a new one on me, but hey, sure,
I think we can help you out. Say, while I have you on the line, there
was one thing…</p>
<p><strong>74 int. house chamber - day 74</strong>: The SPEAKER
administers the oath of office to the assembled House.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Do you solemnly swear that you will support
and defend the Constitution of the United States…</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: … against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same…</p>
<p><strong>75 int. tommy’s office - day - video - wide shot of house
75</strong>: The 435 Members taking the oath, watched on C-span by
Loretta, Armando, Van Dyke, and Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: … that you take this obligation freely,
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion…</p>
<p><strong>76 int. house chamber - day 76</strong>: ON IOWA taking the
oath, his toddler in his arms. PAN along faces of other Members… to
Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: … and that you will well and faithfully
discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter. So
help you God?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: Congratulations. You are now Members of
Congress.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: It’s just that – I’m so happy you
straightened out.</p>
<p><strong>77 int. cannon top floor - day 77</strong>: A beautiful black
woman, 20s, walks briskly down the busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There’s
intelligence in her eyes, and fire.</p>
<p><strong>77 continued: 77</strong>: She makes her way down the
corridor, exchanging AD LIB greetings, glancing in at the sedate
receptions, and drawing closer to the source of the REGGAE – Tommy’s
office. She looks in.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. tommy’s reception area - day 78</strong>: It’s
packed, mainly with men. Everyone has drinks and talks noisily. It looks
like a fraternity smoker for lobbyists. MUSIC comes from a boom box. The
bar – a tablecloth over some desks – is lavishly stocked. So are the
bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves. ANGLE ON LORETTA,
in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing
a little table, handing Celia a name-tag.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Celia’s hands print CELIA KIRBY. PRO BONO.
BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a</p>
<p><strong>fourth lobbyist</strong>: It’s an informal breakfast. You
give us your views, we give you bacon and eggs, plus a couple of
thousand dollar honorarium. For your favorite charity.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: The Tommy Johnson Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Honorarium. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Herring, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>fourth lobbyist</strong>: Uh, no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Really? We’ve got it in cream sauce and in
wine sauce.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: I think I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is this? Where’s the cheese?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: The cheese guy didn’t return my call. So I
called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, that’s just wonderful. Sixty heavy
hitters drop in, and I’m feeding ’em cat food.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’ll talk about this later.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hi there. Glad you could make it. So you’re…
Celia Kirby. That’s an extremely beautiful name. For an extremely
beautiful woman.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Wow! That’s smooth. After ten straight hours
on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that’s
exactly the kind of line I’m ready to fall for.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whoa, slow down.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me,
which one’s Congressman Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What if I said… me?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman, just how
deep is the shit I’m standing in?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Why don’t we just start
over again?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Celia Kirby. I’m the legislative director of
Pro Bono.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ah. Pro Bon. That’s an extremely beautiful
name. For an extremely beautiful organization. Um… what is it?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: We’re a public interest research and advocacy
group. I’d like to brief you on our priorities this session. Can I call
your AA to get on your schedule?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why don’t you brief me over dinner
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I want an appointment, Congressman, not a
date.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, sure, we’ll type it up on the schedule,
it’ll be an appointment, except with wine and flowers on the table.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: No thanks. I really should be going.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Won’t you at least stay for a drink and some
herring?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I’m afraid I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well then, can I tempt you with a smelt?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: No thanks. Nice to meet you. I’ll be in touch
with your office. I especially look forward to hearing your view on
extending the sexual harassment law to include congressmen.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I love the way you say that.</p>
<p><strong>79 ext. capitol - day 79</strong>: A fine Washington
morning.</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. capitol steps - day 81</strong>: Rep. ELIJAH
MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge’s ass, is shaking hands and
saying goodbye to some Constituents. Dodge approaches.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I heard in the steam room you’re going to try
to screw up my ethics bill.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Not screw up. Amend.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Come on, Eli, your amendments don’t have a
chance in hell to pass. My bill isn’t perfect, I know, but it’ll pass.
And the President’ll sign it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: “Isn’t perfect”? Dick, your bill’s the
Incumbents Protection Act! How can you even call it an ethics bill?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Because the public wants an ethics bill! So
that’s what we call it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: But it’s got no teeth! It won’t change a
thing, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Come on, Eli, you’re a politician, too. The
less you’re going to do about something, the more you have to talk about
it. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I see. We close the bank, we stop the
rubber checks, we raise the prices in the barber shop, we stop fixing
parking tickets, and abracadabra! We say we’ve cleaned up Congress.
Well, I don’t think the American people want what this place has
become.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: That’s the beauty of it! They must, Eli –
they keep re-electing us.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Not anymore! This new Congress is full of
new faces.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t read too much into that. A few
extra retirements, some redistricting – nothing more than that. It’s
still business as usual up here.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I live in the real world, Eli. Do you? What’s
unemployment up to in your district? Eight percent? Eight-five?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Eight point six.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar
demonstration plant, Eli. It could mean a whole lot to a district – new
jobs, new construction – that interest you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You can’t bribe me, Dick.</p>
<p><strong>82 int. dodge’s reception area - day 82</strong>: Dodge and
Marshall enter.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Eli, the people who elected you. They sent
you here to help them. Don’t you want to?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Not if it means supporting your bill. All
you want is the perfect platform to campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge.
Mr. Clean. What a joke!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Come on board, Eli. You know – you can’t save
the world if you can’t save your seat.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We haven’t met. Eli Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Tommy Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I know. The Florida upset. Well, now that
you’re here, what are you going to do with it? You gonna feather your
own nest, or are you gonna make something of your office?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I plan to be as good a congressman as all the
others.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Exactly what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, ever since I got back from Nam, I’ve
wanted to do something about the rain forest –</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No, do me a favor, don’t tell me. I try
not to get depressed until the second week of a new session.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Eli, you’ll excuse us – we have a
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Johnson, I’m the chairman of a committee up
here called Power and Industry. We’ve got an open seat, and I was
wondering if you’d consider filling it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is this good news?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Well, it is a difficult assignment – look at
what we cover: energy, health, telecommunications, environment… the
committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests. These are
powerful people, they’ve got all the money in the world, and they’re not
shy about using it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So… this is very good news.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Most members would give their right nut for
it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So what do you want from me, Dick?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Congressman… I just want you to smile for the
cameras.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. power and enterprise committee - day 84</strong>: The
committee members – all white males, except Tommy – mill around,
awaiting the start of the hearings. As the TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes
Tommy’s hand warmly. Big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs. Dodge
breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: So, Congressman, welcome to the honey
pot. You should be one happy freshman.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah? Well, I’m not. I’m suspicious. One
thing I’ve learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing,
the nothing ain’t nothing. It’s something. What is it? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Congressman, I don’t want you to take
this the wrong way, but… you’re black. And I mean that in the nicest
possible way.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Dodge wants to run for Speaker. And he
ain’t gonna make it without votes from the black caucus.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Tommy, someone I want you to meet…</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson? Meet the
new member of the committee. Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Pleased to meet you, Barclay.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: Skeeter. Please. Been called that since
boarding school.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Skeeter.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: Damned fine to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “Tommy. Please. Been called that since reform
school.”</p>
<p><strong>84 continued: 84</strong>: ON THE UPPER DAIS, Dodge
gavels…</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: This EPA oversight hearing of the Committee
on Power and Industry will come to order. I’d like to welcome our first
witness, the distinguished Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency… … but before I do, I note that a new Member is joining us today,
the distinguished gentleman from Florida.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. tommy’s reception area - day 85</strong>: Tommy’s
office walls are now richly hung with plaques, awards, and framed
photos. We see he has been named the PESTICIDE COALITION’S Man of the
Month. The winner of the NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION’S Achievement Award.
The MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA’S Outstanding Young
Legislator. Etc. The liquor is gone. Loretta is at the receptionist’s
desk. A LOBBYIST enters.</p>
<p><strong>fifth lobbyist</strong>: Morning. Ron Yaeger. Snack-PAC –
Snack Foods Political Action Committee. I have a ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Please have a seat. The congressman is
running just a little bit late.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Would you care for some herring?</p>
<p><strong>86 int. capitol function room - day 86</strong>: Tommy rises
to speak at a breakfast meeting. The podium bears the seal of the
American Poultry Association.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let me start with a confession. I don’t know
much about poultry. But I do know something about people. And let me
tell you: I like you people. So when you have something to say about
poultry, I listen. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. catacombs - moving - day 87</strong>: Capitol Hill is
actually two worlds: the aboveground buildings that visitors and
television cameras see, and the catacombs, the busy tunnels and
corridors connecting the congressional office buildings and the Capitol.
They’re surprisingly unglamorous – exposed pipes, white- washed brick
walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs – and through them move the
legislators and their staffs. And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO
DAH. He loves this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the
Cashier.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: My man.</p>
<p><strong>telephone man</strong>: Tommy! What’s up, man?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sweet Sue. Third race at Santa Anita.</p>
<p><strong>88 int. tommy’s reception area - day 88</strong>: Several
lobbyists are now awaiting Tommy balancing plates of herring on their
knees. Some are enjoying it more than others. Tommy breezes in.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, how you folks doin’, good to see you,
Van Dyke making you comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Be with y’all shortly.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She in there?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Stick around for this, Reinhardt. I’ve
finally figured something out about the women in this town.</p>
<p><strong>89 int. tommy’s office - day 89</strong>: Tommy and Reinhardt
meeting with Celia and an elfin guy in corduroy.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Thank you for seeing us, congressman, we
won’t take up much of your time. This is Ira Schecter, our research
director.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Hi, good to meet you, you folks know Reinhardt,
don’t you? Don’t rush, Miss Kirby, we can take as long as we want.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: But you have people waiting, and –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s all right. They can wait.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: These are issue papers. This session we’re
targeting auto insurance premiums, child safety, and food additives. As
votes come up, we know you’ll be hearing plenty from the other side.
We’d just like a clean shot at making our case, too.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: So, we’ll follow up with your staff in the
next week or…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait a minute, you just got here. I clean my
calendar, and you’re out the door. Let’s back up, give this stuff the
attention it deserves. Car insurance… Ira, what do you pay?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh, I’ve got an ’85 Plymouth, about six-fifty a
year…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop shop
wouldn’t give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that. Or
so I’ve heard. But I’m flying blind here, I need depth. Could Miss Kirby
put together a briefing? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig
into the issues?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Oh… we’d be delighted. We’ve got some figures
that will amaze you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Well, we won’t take up any more…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child
safety?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Well, we’re sponsoring a bill imposing safety
standards on imported toys…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Great! About time! I hate imported toys. What
about food additives? How about we block out a few evenings, you can
take me through the details.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Celia, if that’s what the Congressman wants…
any problem?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: You want to do this in the evening?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: I’m away for the next two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: So, when can Celia start your briefings?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Saturday night?</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Saturday night sounds fine.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Fine. Wednesday morning. Nine- fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. house gym - night 91</strong>: The regular evening
pickup basketball game. Even among these ruthless players, Tommy’s
street moves are outstand- ingly down and dirty. His principal
accomplice: Elijah Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. locker room - house gym - night 92</strong>: A
standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad Members. It’s Tommy’s
shuffle and deal. He is convincingly awkward. A BULLDOG of a man
examines his hand, tosses two cards in. He assembles his new hand. Four
fives and an ace.</p>
<p><strong>92 continued: 92</strong>: ON Tommy’s hand. A pair of threes.
The betting starts, at a couple of chips, and comes round to Tommy. He
pushes a stack of chips to the center.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Let’s get serious, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. catacombs - night 93</strong>: Tommy, Marshall, and
the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the MEMBERS ONLY door and move through
the catacombs.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon.
I want you to co- sponsor my amendments.</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: You make a persuasive case, Eli.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That wasn’t a yes.</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: I promise to give it the attention it
deserves.</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: Better luck next time, son.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He took six hundred dollars off you that
last hand, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, he’s taking a real shine to me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: If I didn’t know better, I’d say you lost
to him on purpose.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of
the ethics committee roll you once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You fit in real well up here. Too
well.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So Eli, how come you haven’t asked for my
help with your amendments?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Give it a rest, Tommy. You’ve got a great
jump shot. But everyone knows you’re Dick Dodge’s boy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m nobody’s boy, mister.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t waste your outrage on me. I know
what you are.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m no different from anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s not true. Some people here actually
try to do something besides save their own ass.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You
remind me of my father.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh, really? How so?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He thought I was scum, too.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Aren’t you going to vote?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Vote? Is that what that is? We got a pool
going in the office on when it’ll go off next.</p>
<p><strong>93a int. lobby outside house chamber - day 93a</strong>: It’s
called “Gucci Gulch.” The lobby just outside the doors to the House
chamber is pandemonium – a sea of lobbyists, lawyers, PACmen, Members,
and staffers urgently trying to find their masters and signal them
thumbs-up or-down. Tommy enters, sweeps the room with his eyes, looking
for Reinhardt, shrugs, then goes through the doors onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>93b int. house chamber - day 93b</strong>: Tommy goes to a
console on the rear of a seat. A blue light says OPEN. Tommy inserts a
card . Red, green, and amber lights at buttons labeled NAY, YEA, and
PRES. Tommy shrugs, pushes NAY.</p>
<p><strong>93c int. lobby outside house chamber - day 93c</strong>: As
Tommy heads away, he passes a class trip – a dozen fifth-graders and
their TEACHER, who hails him.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Excuse me – Congressman? Do you have a
moment? We’re from the Hawthorne Avenue School, in Union, New Jersey?
I’m Mrs. Kozlowski. Social Studies. We were just learning how a bill
becomes a law.</p>
<p>****: Was that a vote?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes, it was.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: And what did you vote?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I voted “Nay.” It’s a terrible bill. It’d
destroy the fabric of American life.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: And what was the vote on?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what that vote was
about.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Guy’s got a real knack for explaining
things.</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: Well, it was a motion to reconsider the motion
to reconsider.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: No, it was the rule on amending the
reauthorization.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Which means?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Clean Air.</p>
<p><strong>rafe</strong>: School lunches.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re in excellent hands, kids.</p>
<p><strong>94 int. restaurant - day 94</strong>: A NOISY restaurant
popular with lobbyists. Power photos on the wall. Table hopping. People
SHOUTING greetings across the room. Waiters in long aprons. Tommy is
having lunch with Tommy O’Connor.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: You’re a gentleman, Tommy. We can always
do bid’ness – I like that in a Member.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thank you, Tommy. I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Listen, I’d like to do more money for you
– I just need to know your positions on a few issues.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: For instance, where are you on sugar price
supports?</p>
<p><strong>94 continued: 94</strong>: Tommy has no idea, but he’s
certainly open to suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sugar price supports. Where do you think I
should be, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Shit – makes no difference to me. If
you’re for ’em, I got money for you from my sugar producers in Louisiana
and Hawaii. If you’re against ’em, I got money for you from the candy
manufacturers.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You pick.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Let’s put you down as for. Now what about
putting limits on malpractice awards?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Well, if you’re for ’em, I got money from
the doctors and insurance companies. If you’re against ’em, I got money
from the trial lawyers. Tell you what, let’s say against. Now how about
pizza?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll stick with the salad.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Not for lunch, shmuck, for PAC money. A
lot of the frozen pizzas use phony cheese. There’s a law pending
requiring them to disclose it on their labels. Where do you stand?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: If I vote for the labels…then I get money
from the dairy industry…</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And if I vote against the labels, I get money
from the frozen food guys.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Excellent! And don’t forget the ranchers,
because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: A pepperoni lobby. I love this town.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: So which is it?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to them my
office smelled like smelt for a week.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: All right. For.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So Tommy, tell me – with all this money on
every side, how does anything get done?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: It doesn’t! That’s the genius of the
system!</p>
<p><strong>95 int. tommy’s office - day 95</strong>: A briefing in
progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia, Ira, a couple of other Pro
Bono types. Tommy is riveted by Celia.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: It comes down to a question of what is
acceptable risk. Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes
cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision?
Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on
it?</p>
<p><strong>96 int. tommy’s boiler room - day 96</strong>: Tommy’s staff
shares one small office. Everyone’s on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson is
calling. Can you take his call? Thank you. Please hold.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Willie, he just picked up
another call. Listen, I know why he was calling – he hasn’t heard from
you about his fundraiser…</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: … That’s right, Mr. Brown, on the
thirtieth… A thousand a couple…A whole table? He’ll be so happy to hear
it. Thank you so much. Loretta! Put down nuclear power for ten g’s.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Cool. Mr. Newburg? It’s Miss Loretta, from
Congressman Johnson’s office, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Say, the congressman’s going to be out your
way next week… Palm Springs, the Bob Hope Classic – yes, a celebrity
player. As long as he’s on the coast, we were wondering whether you
aerospace people might want to lay on a lunch so you can hear his views…
Uh-huh … Uh-huh… Lovely. Now what kind of contribution to his foundation
you folks thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>97 int. tommy’s office - day 97</strong>: Celia continues her
briefing.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: …And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight
per hundred-thousand. Um…am I losing you on these mortality rates?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, I was just wondering how much of this is
a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn’t
the Merton Act cover most of this?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Hmmm, that’s an excellent point. Let me see
something…</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Wow…you’re right. Maybe we can get them to
amend Merton-Simmons.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, for Merton to apply you have to show
high contagion…sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than
the common clod.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Common cold. Must have picked up a little
dyslexia over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I see. Well, I must say I’m pretty
impressed.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re also impressively pretty.</p>
<p><strong>97 continued: 97</strong>: Celia is startled. Tommy is
embarrassed…the dumb compliment he’s just spoken was one Reinhardt typed
on the computer screen.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Oh come on…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re right. Sorry. Excuse me a second.
Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>98 ext. gulf stream jet - airborne - day 98</strong>: A jet
flies through the sky.</p>
<p><strong>99 int. gulf stream jet - day 99</strong>: Tommy and handful
of other Members listen to their GUN LOBBYIST host.</p>
<p><strong>gun lobbyist</strong>: Frankly, we think the semi-automatic
has gotten a bad rap. That’s why the American Sporting Gun Users PAC put
together this trip.</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. duck blind - day 100</strong>: Tommy, wearing full
L.L. Bean drag, wading with the other Members. Someone blows a shrieking
DUCK CALL. A flock takes flight. Everyone in the group raises their
weapons: AK-47s. A burst of GUNFIRE. Rambo time. We SEE the flock still
flying. One duck drops at the feet of the hunters.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Must have had a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>scrap iron institute celebrity pro-am.</strong>: Tommy tees
off. He is wearing a veritable pro shop of custom golf gear, all
emblazoned with logos of corporate sponsors and lobbies. He hits the
ball about 200 yards…but more or less perpendicular to the hole. REVEAL
BOB HOPE standing nearby, watching.</p>
<p><strong>bob hope</strong>: I knew all these congressmen get a slice,
but I didn’t know it was that big.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. jet - day 101</strong>: Tommy on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Did you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>102 int. pro bono offices - day 102</strong>: Celia at her
desk in the somewhat ratty Pro Bono offices.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, a fact-finding mission, some issue
conferences, a few speaking engagements, a charity event… the usual.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: More like the Petroleum Institute Ski Cup,
the NRA Open, the –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey. Have lunch with me tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I can’t – we’re having a press
conference.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is it – the ozone layer? No fault?
Killer apples?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Toy safety. Wait a minute. Tomorrow’s Friday.
Aren’t you back early?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You remembered! That means you missed me.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. jefferson memorial - night 103</strong>: Tommy and
Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees by the Tidal Basin.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So, how’d you end up hustling for Pro Bono
instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer,
right?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Oh, I was for a while. It… depressed me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can
you get? Doesn’t it depress you to lose all the time?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Sometimes. Mostly it gets me angry. And the
anger keeps me going. Sure, I wouldn’t mind winning a few. And it’s not
like I’m allergic to money…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: God, it’s so embarrassing to come out and say
it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Meaning. I need my life to mean
something.</p>
<p><strong>103 continued: 103</strong>: This actually hits Tommy. Celia,
embarrassed, changes the subject.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: My question is, how’d you get named after a
Memorial?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Grandma like Jefferson. Y’know, “Life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” It’s a lot to live up to, so I
specialized in the last part.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: And how’s the pursuit going?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fine…’til I met you. Now…the better I do, the
worse I feel.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So…when can I see you again? How about dinner
Saturday night?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: How about Sunday morning?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Brunch?</p>
<p><strong>104 int. old church - baltimore - day 104</strong>: In the
pulpit, Rev. Elijah Marshall thunders:</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The wages of sin is death! And to the man
who values Gold over Goodness…the Lord allows no exemptions!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: To the man who shows no respect for the
privilege of walking this Earth, God allows no deductions!</p>
<p>****: And to the man whose pockets are bulging and whose soul is
empty… the Lord grants no 90-day extension!</p>
<p>****: And when the last trump sounds, believe me, you will be
audited!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is one hell of a date.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hello, darling. Glad you could make
it.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uncle Eli?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: My niece says you’re not half as slimy as
I thought.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Your niece?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That would put you somewhere between a
lizard and a toad. Quite a step up.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How could I have missed the family
resemblance?</p>
<p><strong>107 int. cannon top floor - day 107</strong>: WHISTLING
happily, Tommy rounds the corner and heads to his office.</p>
<p><strong>107 continued: 107</strong>: Ahead of him, encamped in the
hallway, he sees a phalanx of SENIOR CITIZENS, many carrying placards,
and some camera crews. Tommy adjusts his tie, turns on the charm, and
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ladies! Looking good! How can I help you
folks today!</p>
<p><strong>hattie</strong>: Don’t “Ladies!” me, you dick!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Now let me get this straight. You voted to
make people on Medicare pay more money to their doctors?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The Medical Association made a persuasive
case. Ten grand from their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Tommy – if I’m not mistaken, you wouldn’t be
here without the good senior citizens of your district. You got to dance
with the girl that brung you, son. If you have a bit of business to do,
do it quietly… in the corridors… in the subcommittees… with little
amendments. You mess around on the big ones like Medicare, you’ll be
dead meat on election day.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, well, then it’s thanks for the
memories, and on to the next gig.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Do you know what your problem is, son? You
don’t think big enough. You have a real knack for this town, but you
have the soul of a two-bit hustler. Listen to me, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Five hundred thirty-five Members of Congress.
Some are smart, and some stupid. Some good, some not. But all of them,
son, all of them consumed by the single overriding imperative that
defines the very Washington way of life.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Getting re-elected.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait a minute. You’re talkin’ ’bout my
re-election?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You don’t know what percent of the incumbents
who ran last time got re-elected, do you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Fifty? Sixty?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Ninety-six. And ninety-eight before that.
It’s like that election after election. If you don’t fuck up, you can be
here, raking it in, for life. Life, Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I can think of worse places to get life.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I knew you had it in you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So how do I get the Silver Foxes off my
ass?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Oh, throw them a bone… why don’t you
co-sponsor a bill for mandatory universal health insurance?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Nothing. It’ll never pass.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. tommy’s reception area - day 109</strong>: A couple
of Lobbyists await Tommy. Van Dyke mans the desk. In come ELLEN JUBA,
40s, and her 13-year-old daughter, MICKEY, whose pony tail sticks out
from her Florida Marlins baseball cap.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Yes, I’m Ellen Juba. This is my daughter,
Mickey. We’d like to see our congressman. We live in the district.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Just a moment, please. Could you come out?
Thank you. Be right with you. I like your hat.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How do you do, I’m Miss Loretta, public
liaison for the congressman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Ellen Juba. My daughter Mickey. We’d like
to see him.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Y’all from the district? Up here seein’ the
sights? How’d you folks like some gallery passes? Go on over and listen
to the great debates of our day?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We don’t want to go to the gallery. We want
to see Congressman Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: How ’bout a House key ring for each of you?
Here – see that? Isn’t that something? Turns into a pen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: You don’t understand. We’re not tourists.
We’re constitutents.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You aren’t with some organization, are you,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: I’m a goddam citizen! Isn’t that
enough!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: We’re not leaving here till we see him!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Oh, Armando? Could you come out front,
please?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look what I won! Must be that new racket.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: There a problem, congressman?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Congressman? You?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Get your hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Let go of her, you creep!</p>
<p><strong>sixth lobbyist</strong>: Careful, she may be armed!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Stop it! Get away from her!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Come on, Ma. It’s okay. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Not just me.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. tommy’s office - day 110</strong>: Tommy and his
staff listen to the Jubas.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: I was lucky. They said they got it all. I’m
going to be okay. But what about the others?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The others?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: They call it a “cancer cluster.” Oh, at
first, none of us in the neighborhood wanted to believe it, but then we
all saw it – for me, it was when the two-year-old across the street
developed a brain tumor, same as Mickey. We looked at everything – the
water, the air, dump sites, insects, you name it. But we didn’t have to
look that far. It was staring us in the face.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Power lines.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: High-voltage power lines. The wires cause
magnetic fields – and the magnetic fields cause cancer. Especially in
children.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I never heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: The studies, the numbers – it’s all
there.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You’re not actually going to read those, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, they’ll be read…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Why don’t you come see for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Five children in the neighborhood have
cancer. One more has precancerous lesions. Pregnant women around here
are scared to death.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is Mickey’s school?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: Turns out a lot of schools are near power
lines. The land’s cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power
companies in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But isn’t the school district
responsible?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: We asked the superintendent to measure
the magnetic field inside the school. He said, Okay, only it’ll cost
forty thousand dollars, and what program did we want him to cut that
from?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. juba</strong>: We’re nobody, congressman. You’re
somebody. We need your help.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Do you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: It’s impossible to know. No one’s really
looked into it hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But why isn’t it being investigated?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Why didn’t they investigate breast implants
all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill,
Halcion? Why isn’t anything being investigated? It’s always the
same.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Money talks.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There must be something I can do for those
people.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re actually developing a
conscience.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shit, I hope not – it’d be a fucking nuisance
in Congress.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: No, that’s not fair. Some people on the Hill
actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don’t forget
why they went to Washington, and who sent them.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No shit. Oh, yeah, I met one of those geeks.
So what can I do?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Make a stink. Round up some Members and hold
a press conference. Get that committee of yours to hold hearings. Haul
in in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Surgeon General, the
National Academy of Sciences. Get the issue on every breakfast table in
America.</p>
<p><strong>112a int. power and enterprise committee - day 112a</strong>:
A press conference. Half a dozen congressmen, Tommy among them. Iowa is
speaking to the few Cameras and Reporters. Beside him, Mickey Juba and
her mother. Reinhardt and Ceila among the handful of staff and
onlookers.</p>
<p><strong>iowa</strong>: This goes beyond personal tragedy. It goes to
a public health hazard of unknown proportions. It goes to the right of
ordinary people to know all the facts –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, right – people ought to know if their
neighborhoods are killing them.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Amen, gentleman. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What a fine effort this is. I am totally
sympathetic. Congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as
possible. The American people deserve no less.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Message: we care.</p>
<p><strong>112b int. tommy’s house - night 112b</strong>: Tommy and
Celia are watching the press conference on TV.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Well, congratulations. You’ve found yourself
your own hopeless cause.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Speaking of hopeless causes…</p>
<p><strong>113 omitted 113</strong>: &amp; &amp; 114 114</p>
<p><strong>115 int. dodge’s office - night 115</strong>: An impressive
THUNDERSTORM pounds on Dodge’s windows.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: On the rocks, or neat?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Whatever you’re having.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Well, why ruin good bourbon with the taste of
some shitty Sears icemaker, that’s what I always say. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Son, you’re a real comer. I wouldn’t be
surprised if you ended up in the leadership. I’ll say this: if I were
Speaker, I’d sleep better with you as a lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, to
tell you the truth, I didn’t know you’d be on my side on those power
lines.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: But I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But you said you were sympathetic –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Of course I did. We’re all sympathetic to
little girls with cancer. But I’m not sympathetic to holding an
inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But you said –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I know what I said. But that was just a press
conference, son. I wasn’t under oath.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yes?… Bring them right in! Look. Son. It’s
great to get your name in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I bet the gentleman from Iowa was all over
the evening news in Des Moines tonight. Getting good press – letting
them know you care – that’s what it’s all about. Smart move, Tommy. But
that’s as far as I’d go with this, if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What a surprise!</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Mr. Chairman!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Mr. Chairman! Hello, Tommy. Zeke you’re
looking well, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Good to see you, you old sum’ bitch.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Evening, Mr. Chairman, thanks for taking
the – Tommy, you s.o.b., they let you in here? You folks finally get to
press flesh! Olaf, meet Tommy Johnson. Tommy, Olaf Andersen. Chairman of
Gulf Coast Power.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The boys here have told me a lot about
you.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Yeah – I told him you voted for him!</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Glad to meet you, son. They tell me you’ve
got a real talent for the game.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: And this is Zeke Bridges, CEO of Pyramid
Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Congressman.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Help me with these, would you, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Chivas on the rocks?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: You look awfully familiar.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Tommy and I were just talking about power
lines.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, what a coincidence. I thought this
little party might be for me. You may not like this. I think we should
hold those hearings.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You really fell for the line that parents
group fed you, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How’d you know I met the parents group?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Oh, I keep my ear to the ground, that’s what
a good politician does. Listen, Tommy, why don’t we just get Olaf’s take
on this.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: It’s tragic, cancer’s a terrible thing,
but there’s no way you can link it to power lines. Truth is, there’s a
bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a
microwave oven, than by those derricks.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But there are studies that say –</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: For every study that says one thing, I’ll show
you a study saying another. We’ve studied it ourselves. Nada.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: There’s not a single state health official
anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But what if you’re wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: People didn’t use to say smoking causes
cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we
wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: “Kill us”? “Kill us”? You calling me a
murderer? You’re saying there’s blood on these hands? How dare you talk
to me like that, you –</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Calm down, Olaf, calm down, he didn’t mean
it that way, did you, son? Alright, gentlemen. Easy.</p>
<p><strong>115 continued: 115</strong>: Andersen backs off, regains his
composure. The outburst makes an impression on Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Tommy – do you want to move the power
lines? Do you know how much it would cost to bury them? Millions. Tens
of millions. I don’t have that money. The state doesn’t have that money.
You people up here sure don’t have that money. You know who’d end up
paying for it? Folks who sent you here, that’s who.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Now how’d you like the people in your
district to think of you as the putz who tripled their electric bill?
You think they’d thank you for that on election day?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: All I’m saying is, maybe we should hold
hearings to look at –</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Think for a minute, boychik. You hold your
hearings. Overnight, everyone who lives near a substation finds the
value of his home in the toilet. You kill the real estate market.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: You kill the insurance companies.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: You kill the school district.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You kill the local economy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: For a smart boy, you’re not thinking very
politically.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Maybe I should think about it.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yeah, the system ain’t perfect, but the fleas
come with the dawg.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Oh, by the way, Tommy, on a completely
different subject – You don’t have a state PAC yet, do you? I’d like to
give you a hundred thousand dollar corporate contribution to start one
up.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: My company would be honored to do the
same.</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Can you do that? I thought there were limits
–</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Oh, it’s all aboveboard, we all believe
deeply in the rules. It’s just that the state rules are often more
flexible about these things.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Are you interested?</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: I’m always interested in the happiness of my
constituents.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>116 omitted 116</strong>: &amp; &amp; 117 117</p>
<p><strong>118 ext. tommy’s house - night 118</strong>: Tommy pulls up
in a Corvette with Florida congressional plates in front of his Capitol
Hill row house.</p>
<p><strong>119 int. tommy’s bedroom - night 119</strong>: Tommy slips
into bed next to Celia, who’s half asleep.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Mmmm…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mmmm…</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: So what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Dodge. The hearings.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh – I, uh, haven’t asked him yet.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It wasn’t the right moment. Besides, I was
thinking, maybe I ought to line up some other Members first – you know,
get my ducks in a row.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. house steam room - day 120</strong>: Dick Dodge and
several other towel-clad MEMBERS.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You see that ABC poll?</p>
<p><strong>third member</strong>: Free fall.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: President in trouble like that, he’s liable
to do something desperate. Some damn fool stunt.</p>
<p><strong>fourth member</strong>: Invade Japan.</p>
<p><strong>fifth member</strong>: Declare war on Congress, more like
it.</p>
<p><strong>120 continued: 120</strong>: The door opens. Eli Marshall,
fully dressed, comes in.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You shafted me on the ethics bill.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hello, Eli, good to see you. Why don’t you
loosen your tie?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s a closed rule. I can’t get my
amendments on the floor. I can’t get a recorded vote. I can’t get
squat.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Last time I looked, it was the Rules
Committee in charge of that. This isn’t the Rules Committee, Eli. This
is the steam room.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This is the U.S. Congress! The American
people deserve better than –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You know what your problem is, Eli? You’ve
got sermonitis.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Can’t open your mouth without climbing into
the pulpit, can you? Why don’t you just calm down, have a massage –</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’ve got news for you, Dick. I’m going to
run against you for Speaker. I may not have a rat’s ass of a chance to
beat you. But I sure as hell can tell the world the kind of sleaze you
stand for.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I went too far with him, I know it. You know
him pretty well, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Come on, you play basketball together, you’re
seeing his niece, you’ve been to his church –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>121 continued: 121</strong>: Dodge indicates his bloodhound
nose.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: He’ll listen to you, Tommy. I want you to go
make peace between us. Tell him we’ll work something out on his
amendments – not a vote, I won’t go that far, but at least he’ll get to
say his piece on the floor. Just get him off my back. Can you do that
for me?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s not a question, is it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: That’s right. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, no – I’ve still got my right nut, I can
work with that.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. crab house - night 122</strong>: A WAITER removes an
empty pitcher of beer.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Another?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The honorable Dick Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know, Eli, sometimes people do things
they regret. Everyone makes mistakes. Fact is, Dick’s been under a lot
of pressure lately –</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That man’s a walking quid quo pro – prid
quo – quid pro quo, and you know it. He put you up to this, didn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t shit me, Tommy. You’re Dick Dodge’s
yes-man. I know what you’re up to. This is damage control.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say
no.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You know why no one on the Hill drops a
dime on anyone else? Mutual assured destruction. Our little gentleman’s
agreement. Everybody has something on somebody, so nobody has anything
on anybody, because everybody wants to save his own ass.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, yeah? What do they have on you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: They think I’m a pompous ass.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shit, that ain’t no secret.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: You sure they don’t want to be alone,
Reinhardt?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: No, no – I bet they’ve been talking about
the ethics bill all night. Come on, Loretta, you’ll know how to get
Marshall’s mind off business.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Shit, this place isn’t about passing laws
any more. It isn’t about doing good any more. All it’s about is… being
here.</p>
<p><strong>124 continued: 124</strong>: Loretta and Reinhardt approach
their table.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Well, as I live and breathe. Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Eli, this is Loretta Hicks, from my staff.
Loretta, Congressman Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Entirely mine.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know Reinhardt, my AA?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Excuse me, congressman, could I just do a
couple of quick calendar things with you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Would you care for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Tell you the truth, nothing for me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Well, when a pretty lady shoots him down,
an old man knows it’s time to go home.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You kids have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Listen, you gentlemen look like you’ve
had a few – Loretta, why don’t you be a designated driver?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Excellent idea.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Ah. The good Samaritan.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Good night, y’all.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Now we’ve already got the Bankruptcy
Institute breakfast tomorrow, but if you don’t mind we could wedge in
the Prune Board –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m packing it in.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Can we talk while I drive you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thanks, I’ll walk. I could use the air.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. marshall’s car - moving - night 125</strong>:
Marshall and Loretta are singing.</p>
<p><strong>126 ext. capitol hill street - night 126</strong>: Tommy is
on foot. Marshall’s car, with its Maryland congressional plates, pulls
over.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Come on, honey, no use you getting
mugged.</p>
<p><strong>127 int. marshall’s car - moving - night 127</strong>:
MARSHALL and LORETTA</p>
<p><strong>128 ext. traffic circle - night - a hooker 128</strong>: in
high sling-back heels.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Check out the fuck-me pumps on that. Mm-mm.
I gotta get me some shoes like that.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Loretta! Please! Your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>131 int. taxi - night 131</strong>: The Taxi Driver looks at
the wreck for a moment. Then he lays rubber and SQUEALS away.</p>
<p><strong>132 int./ext. marshall’s car - night 132</strong>: On the
back floor, Tommy stirs. Seems to be okay. Lifts himself to see up
front. The windshield is smashed. Loretta and Marshall are both
unconscious. Tommy climbs into the front but can’t get the door open. He
kicks out a broken window and climbs through. He runs to a phone on the
corner and dials 911.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I need an ambulance right away.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson here,
sorry to call at this hour, is Dick back from the Gridiron dinner yet?
Could I speak with him for just a moment?</p>
<p><strong>133 int. dodge bedroom - night 133</strong>: MRS. DODGE is in
bed. She hands the phone to Dodge, who’s in white tie and tails, looking
more sinister than splendid.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dodge</strong>: Tommy Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Good news doesn’t come at this hour.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I went out with Marshall. We got into an
accident. He’s out cold. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Were you driving?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No. Someone else. Loretta.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The girl from your office?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah. She’s out, too. I don’t like the way it
looks. For anybody. Look. You said you wanted to get back into
Marshall’s good graces. Well, here’s an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Listen carefully. Tell the ambulance to take
you to Walter Reed. It’s a privilege they give congressmen. It’s also
the only hospital without a bunch of goddam reporters shtupping the
nurses in exchange for leaks. They’ll keep it quiet. I’ll handle the
police. You go home and keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>134 int. parking garage - night 134</strong>: Two figures
approach one another in the shadows: Reinhardt, and the Taxi Driver who
rear-ended Marshall’s car. The cabbie nods. Reinhardt hands him an
envelope. The Driver inspects the cash.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. tommy’s bathroom/bedroom - morning 135</strong>:
Tommy is shaving. He HEARS the local tv news from the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>washington anchor</strong>: … and the Beltway is bumper-to
bumper, so you might as well take a day of annual leave and enjoy
yourself. At the top of the news, Maryland Congressman Elijah Marshall
is in satisfactory condition at Walter Reed Hospital after an overnight
accident in the District.</p>
<p><strong>136 video - ext. walter reed hospital - gates - day
136</strong>: A CORRESPONDENT doing a stand-up.</p>
<p><strong>correspondent</strong>: That’s right, Tom. Marshall
reportedly had alcohol in his blood. Also slightly injured was an
unidentified woman whom police say has a record in several states for
prostitution.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>washington anchor</strong>: Linda, Congressman Marshall –
that’s Reverend Marshall, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>correspondent</strong>: Right you are, Tom. How this plays
into his longstanding campaign to reform congressinoal ethics is now
anyone’s guess.</p>
<p><strong>washington anchor</strong>: Thank you. In other news…</p>
<p><strong>137 int. hospital corridor - day 137</strong>: Tommy races
down the corridor. Ahead of him, Celia, coming out of Marshall’s room.
She freezes at the sight of him.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Get away from him.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: And get away from me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I was set up!</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: You were set up? You were in the car! I
didn’t hear your name on the news!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, someone screwed him –</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: “Someone”?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Celia, something stinks here –</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Yeah – it’s you! You don’t give a damn about
anything! And to think, the other night, I actually thought you cared
about someone else.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Not me, you jerk – Mickey Juba! You caved on
those power lines, didn’t you? I knew it. Damn it, I knew it! What did
you get for it? Tommy O’Connor’s box at the Redskins? Someone slip you a
condo in the Virgin Islands?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: If you’d give me a chance to –</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: God, I hate this town – the only reason I
stay is because I hate it so much.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Celia –</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mickey juba</strong>: sitting on the ground, backs to us,
beneath the power lines. A quiet moment. REVERSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT.
Mickey is shuffling a deck of cards.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Is it thumb over, or thumb under?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Under.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not bad, kid. You’ve got potential.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: So what’s happening? I thought you were
going to kick some ass on –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is one’s called the double duke. How
many players?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who’s the mark?</p>
<p><strong>138 continued: 138</strong>: She points to an imaginary poker
player.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Number two – over there.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Your deal.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look at the sucker’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look at your hand.</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: That’s what you’re going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Let’s kick some ass. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Something very important.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. tommy’s living room - day 139</strong>: Tommy
pow-wows with Loretta Van Dyke, and Armando. Aside from a sling, Loretta
looks okay.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Why are we meeting here, Tommy? There
trouble at the office?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “I keep my ear close to the ground.” His ear
my ass. He had an inside man.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: That little fuck Reinhardt?</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Hot damn – I knew my driving wasn’t that
bad. Speaking of which – you think I should wear one of those whiplash
things, Tommy? There some insurance angle I should be working here?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We got bigger fish to fry, darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The big con.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: We gonna git that sucker.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Dick always said I should think big.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Whoa! Aren’t we gettin’ out of our league,
man? That Dodge is a pro!</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: You can’t con a con, Congressman.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Shit, that’s right, Tommy – these
politicians are serious slick fish.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You people gone soft on me? Bunch of fuckin’
incumbents I got here. Now listen up. Thursday morning Dodge has a
breakfast with the Arts Caucus in the Longworth Room. Armando – find out
how fast I can get from Longworth to my office. Loretta – we need some
scoop from the EPA for the roper, I’ll give you a list. Van Dyke – call
Hattie at the Silver Foxes, and –</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Wait a minute – we need a new roper, don’t
we? Everyone around here knows our faces.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Right on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: My man!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Now let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. power and enterprise committee - day 140</strong>:
The Members are being seated for a hearing. At the dais, Tommy
approaches Dodge. A beat as Dodge studies Tommy’s face.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Eli Marshall caught his tail in a crack,
didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You kept my name out of it.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You learn fast.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Do me one favor, Dick. Next time you pull
some heavy shit involving my ass, tip me off, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Alright, son. This hearing of the Power and
Enterprise Committee is now in order. The health of America’s securities
industry –</p>
<p><strong>140 continued: 140</strong>: Reinhardt approaches Tommy and
slips him a packet of materials.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Thanks. Listen, Reinhardt, something’s come
up, and I don’t quite know how to handle it. There’s a guy from the EPA
– I don’t know him – says he wants to see me. Tonight. Out of the
office. Alone, he says. Sound of it makes me nervous. I’d feel better if
you were there.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: You got it, jefe.</p>
<p><strong>141 ext. grant’s statue - night 141</strong>: A man waits,
alone, in the shadow of a large statue. It’s Homer. In a jacket and tie,
his stubble shaved off, he looks like a plausible government worker.
Tommy and Reinhardt approach.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mr. Yancey?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I thought you’d be alone.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He’s my AA. He goes where I go. If you can
trust me, you can trust him.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Congressman, I have information I think you
may want. It’s about something going on at the EPA.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: I got a wife and three kids, and a note on my
house, that’s what I got.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nothin’ comes for nothin’ in this town, do
it? You got any cash on you? I’m kind of light.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This stuff’s pretty good?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: In the right hands, it could mean a great
deal.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del Mar. Blueboy
is running twenty to one. I’d take a major position.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: You have to be shitting me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, not at all – my Cousin Henry spends his
days pumping water into horses’ stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their
butts. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Alright. The White House is putting heat on
the EPA. They want us to announce a major investigation of the relation
between power lines and cancer clusters.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: But didn’t the EPA already do a
study?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah, but when the draft got to the White
House, they didn’t like it. So they brought their own scientists in to
kill it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why did the White House change its mind?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Is there new evidence?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Yeah – their polls have dropped like a rock.
They need an issue. This one makes them look good on the environment,
and they don’t have to spend a penny.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And what good is this to me?</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Come on, congressman, in this town,
information is currency. And advance information is gold.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: But you’ve got to move fast. Once the White
House goes public with this, they can’t turn back. If your friends at
the power company want to kill this investigation, they’d better do it
now. Evening, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Blueboy. Twenty to one. Is your Cousin
Henry always right?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I ain’t got no Cousin Henry.</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. pay phone - by reflecting pool - night 142</strong>:
Reinhardt dials.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dodge’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Mrs. Dodge, it’s Arthur Reinhardt. May I
speak to the Chairman, please?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Are you sitting down?</p>
<p><strong>143 int. art caucus room - day 143</strong>: The Longworth
Room, a small circular committee room with an ornate rotunda. The Arts
Caucus breakfast is ending.</p>
<p><strong>third member</strong>: Unless there is further business, our
caucus stands adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Got a minute, Dick?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Listen, Dick, I heard something. There’s got
to be some bid’ness in it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Maybe we can go in on it together.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The EPA is going to make a stink about power
lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: That’s very interesting, my friend. I’ve
heard that, too.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nothing gets by, do it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: But thank you, son – I’m glad you chose to
share it with me. We do make quite a team, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I – I hope it wasn’t my press conference that
started this.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No, this is a stunt for the polls.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: So do you think there’s something in it for
us?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen’s back,
he’d be extremely appreciative.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And how do we do that?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: My committee writes the EPA’s programs. We
audit their funds. We confirm their appointees. I’ve got them by the
balls.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: And you’re going to – ?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Oh, no, not at all – just… persuasion.
Strenuous persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: That’s allowed?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no. But it’s a
gray area. Who’s to say which is which?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Dick, wait a minute – shouldn’t we check out
the tip? Make sure the EPA’s really going through with this
investigation?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Of course. He should be in by now.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Skeeter Warburton, of course. Always go right
to the top, son.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. dodge’s reception area - day 144</strong>: Dodge
passes his Secretary’s desk on the way into his office.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Get me the EPA Administrator, please.</p>
<p><strong>145 int. corridor/stairwell - cannon - day 145</strong>:
Tommy jogs along the corridor. A tourist Family stares at him. He
explains his haste with a smile –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There’s a vote on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>146 int. catacombs - phone cable room - day 146</strong>: In
a chamber crammed with cables, the Telephone Man listens to a handset.
He now sports a gold Rolex on his wrist – his horse must have come in.
Van Dyke, also there, looks at any array of dials and meters, whose
hands all suddenly move. Some electronic phone CHIRPS, then the filtered
RINGING of a call.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>telephone man</strong>: And there he goes.</p>
<p><strong>147 int. tommy’s office 147</strong>: Loretta wears a beaded
sling, which adds to her look. She is at Tommy’s desk, watching his
phone as it RINGS. Tommy comes in.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The Administrator.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: Office of the Adminstrator. Thank you, I’ll
put you right through.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Warbuton here. Thank you. Mr. Chairman! I do
hope there’s something I can help you with today.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I need a straight answer from you, Skeeter.
Is the White House on your ass about power lines?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Off the record?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I was looking forward to some serious sailing
this week – Tish and I have a lovely spot right by Kennebunkport.
Instead, here I am at three in the morning, writing testimony to your
committee about cancer clusters.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Thanks for your candor, Warburton.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not at all. You must come sailing with us.
Cheers. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Zeke Bridges on line two.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: I’ll just put you through to him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Olaf? Olaf, Zeke Bridges. Listen, you sum’
bitch, I’m so mad, I can’t sit down to shit. Have you heard what I
heard?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: What’s that.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The EPA’s fixing to make a big stink about
power lines and cancer. They’re going to serve us up for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Wait a minute. There’s no scientific proof
–</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Proof don’t mean shit. We’re talking
politics. They make a federal case out of power lines, I’m screwed.
Whole insurance business is screwed. You know how much cash I’d have to
pay out in settlements? Even if I stiffed everybody on claims, the legal
fees’d be enough to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You better believe it. You’re screwed, too.
Every hot dog trial lawyer in America soon be lining up to sue both our
asses. We got to move on this, Olaf. If I wasn’t tied up here, I’d go to
Washington myself. Shouldn’t you be getting on a plane? Just between us
– you find a way to stop this, I’ll find a million bucks if I have
to.</p>
<p><strong>151 int. corporate jet - day 151</strong>: A very worried
Andersen.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. hill corridor - day 152</strong>: Tommy and Dodge
walking along a Capitol hallway.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Olaf will be at my office at five
o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How do we play it?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Cool. Real cool. You just follow my lead.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I don’t know how I can help you on this one,
Olaf. This is the EPA. This is the President.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: This is my lifeblood!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I see that, Olaf, I see that. But in this
town, you pick your fights.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: This could mean six figures, Dick.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: High six figures.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Seven figures?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Between us. It’s not that much – what can you
get for half a million these days?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: How the hell can I funnel that kind of
money to you?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: If that’s what you want, we can always
find a loophole. No one will see your fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: No one will know?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No one will know.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: You’re only in trouble if someone can
prove a connection.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Of course there’s no connection. Olaf’s just
making a contribution as a patriotic citizen. And in return for it, he’s
getting –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Good government.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Exactly. A little access, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>154 int. ornate capitol hallway - day 154</strong>: Dodge,
Andersen, Tommy, and O’Connor walking along. Up ahead, a cocktail
reception. On an easel by the door:</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’ve got to do a drop-by. You gentlemen like
to join me for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>155 int. ornate function room - day 155</strong>: Dodge and
Tommy work the room genially. Tommy spots Celia talking to some Guests
and goes over to her.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Look. Whatever you think of me, just promise
me one thing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Come to the Clean Air hearing tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Power and Enterprise. Noon.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shouldn’t we be heading off, Dick?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Let’s work the room just a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Congressman! Mr. Chairman!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Evening, Reinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Good to see you, sir. By the way, I
thought your opening statement in committee yesterday was brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Well. Look who’s over there – Skeeter
Warburton from the EPA. The very man we want to see.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Have you tried the oysters, Dick?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: At a hazardous waste event? I think we’ll go
talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, he’s the wrong man –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You don’t understand – he’s the perfect
man.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But – but you don’t want to bother him with
this. Talk to one of his underlings –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Nothing beats man-to-man.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Here? Not here!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: A public place. What could be better?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But it’s the wrong time!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: While the iron is hot, son.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: No time like the present.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shut up, Reinhardt, I’m talking to the
Chairman. Beat it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: I’ll go get him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You heard about this stomach thing going
around?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Come on, son, we’ve got the people’s business
to do.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: Mr. Chairman. Congressman.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’ve got a big problem, Skeeter.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Your power lines investigation.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: What power lines investigation?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: We’re off the record, Skeeter. This
witch-hunt for cancer clusters is bad news for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about,
Dick.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Alright, I know you’re being a good soldier
–</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: No, I’m being straight with you –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Then let me be straight with you. You
announce this study – I’m not talking about the results down the road,
mind you, I’m just talking about the announcement – and there’s broken
crockery everywhere. Real estate. Utilities. Insurance. Schools. Local
governments. It’ll cost jobs. Uproot families.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: I agree with you completely. There isn’t
going to be an investigation, old chap, I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m glad we understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: Yes, I think we do.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: And we’ll just forget about that phone call
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>warburton</strong>: We didn’t speak on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: “There isn’t going to be an investigation,
old chap.”</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>155 continued: 155</strong>: They join up with Andersen and
O’Connor.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Worked like a charm. We scared him shitless.
The investigation’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Waiter! Champagne! See you at the Clear
Air hearings.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. tommy’s reception area/corridor - day 156</strong>:
As Reinhardt comes into the office, Tommy intercepts him.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute? I need your
advice on something.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. tommy’s boiler room - day 157</strong>: Van Dyke,
Armando, and Loretta work the phones.</p>
<p><strong>van dyke</strong>: Is this the assignment desk? Yes, I’m
calling from Chairman Dodge’s office, on the Hill. We wanted to be sure
CNN was sending a crew to the Clean Air hearing today.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: No, not the new emission standards. We’re
breaking news. This is the biggest thing since Watergate.</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: This is Cynthia Leeson in the White House
Press Office. My boss wanted me to let you folks know – we’re making a
major announcement at the Clean Air hearings today. No, I can’t tell
you, but it’s hot. Well, if the New York Times wants to be the only
paper in town to miss the story of the year, that’s up to y’all.</p>
<p><strong>158 int. tommy’s cage/corridor - day 158</strong>: Tommy has
drawn Reinhardt into the cage.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I want to do a little something nice for
Dodge. That EPA thing – he’s been good to me, Reinhardt. Is there some
way I can, like, throw a bouquet to him at the hearing today without
having to sit through that boring testimony shit?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Why don’t you ask him to give you the
floor at the start?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: He’s do that?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: For some flattery? In a New York minute.
Just tip him ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma’s plane comes in
at ten. You wouldn’t mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Can’t one of the others do it?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, I don’t trust them the way I trust
you.</p>
<p><strong>159 int. tommy’s office - day 159</strong>: Tommy, joined by
his cronies and the Jubas.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: This is it, people. Game time. Let’s get it
right.</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Tell me one thing, jefe. How do you know
Andersen is going to bite?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t. You run a con, you run a risk.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. power and enterprise committee - day 160</strong>: A
hundred or so members of the public – trade groups, Hill staffers,
lawyers, tourists – settle into their seats. VAN DYKE escorts Hattie
Rifkin and a busload of Silver Foxes. Loretta comes in with Ellen and
Mickey Juba. GRANDMA comes in, on Reinhardt’s arm. She is dressed up as
a biddy, down to a hat with fruit on it. COMMITTEE MEMBERS head for
their seats at the dais. OLAF ANDERSEN is at the witness table, along
with a couple of other businessmen. In a seat behind Andersen, Tommy
O’Connor. THE PRESS. A good turnout, with several camera crews.</p>
<p><strong>washington reporter #1</strong>: You know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>washington reporter #2</strong>: It’s very hot. Electric
cars.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I’m cutting out early.</p>
<p><strong>ira</strong>: Don’t want to run into him?</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Dick, I thought it might be a nice way to
open if I congratulated you on the fine work you been doin’ on this
committee. Really express our appreciation. Especially on behalf of the
minority community.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Why, thank you, son.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wouldn’t hurt to have tape like that in the
bank, would it, Mr. Speaker?</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: Mr. Yancey? Arthur Reinhardt. Are you
testifying for the agency?</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Hello, Homer, dear.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: No, Mrs. Johnson, you must be mistaken –
let me introduce you. This is Mr. Yancey of the EPA.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Don’t be silly, child.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: Homer Norton. Homer’s Pit Stop, Axahatchee,
Florida.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Homer’s known Tommy since they were in
diapers.</p>
<p><strong>reinhardt</strong>: What the – ?</p>
<p><strong>armando</strong>: Move and you’re history.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: This meeting of the Power and Enterprise
Committee to consider the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act is now in
session. Today’s first business is a panel of national leaders in the
field of utilities.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Before I welcome them, Chair would like to
yield to the gentleman from Florida for a word. If there is no objection
from the Committee – ? The gentleman may proceed.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the other members
of this committee, and on behalf of myself, I have a very personal
statement to make. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you –
thank you for your leadership, for your insight, for your boldness…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … and for your courage. Especially your
courage.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: My courage?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Your courage in exposing the corruption that
eats away at this institution. Your courage in taking on the special
interests. Your courage in taking a major new step –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: But I’ve… I’ve… I’ve done nothing new,
nothing at all – what are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re right – integrity isn’t new to you,
Mr. Chairman, it’s second nature to you. Still it’s a rare public
servant who’ll take on the special interest money, take on the PACs
–</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: take on the lobbyists and fat cats –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … and who’ll stand up instead for ordinary
American citizens…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: … the plain people who just want peace of
mind – who just want to know they’re raising their kids in safe
neighborhoods and sending them to safe schools.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a quality that
you have in abundance –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Well, yes, thank you, but we have to move
along, if the gentleman would –</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the Chairman
and I had a meeting in his office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf Coast
Power, and his lobbyist, Mr. Tommy O’Connor – these gentlemen here.
Chairman Dodge and I listened in astonishment as Olaf Andersen offered
us seven figures – that’s one million dollars, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: Dodge double-crossed us.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: One million dollars, if we would stop the EPA
from investigating the connection between power lines and cancer
clusters.</p>
<p><strong>160 continued: 160</strong>: Shocked MURMURS sweep the room.
REINHARDT is aghast. HOMER and ARMANDO are delighted.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Isn’t that right, Mr. Andersen?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: That’s a vicious lie.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Will the gentleman yield?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: That’s not possible! You can’t give anyone
that kind of money!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O’Connor said to
you, quote: “If that’s what you want, we can always find a loophole. No
one will know.” Remember saying that, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>o’connor</strong>: I do not!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I insist that the gentlemen yield!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You can’t deny it, Mr. Andersen! We have the
whole thing on this tape!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge’s courageous
suggestion, I taped the whole conversation. It’s all there.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The people thank you. America thanks you.</p>
<p><strong>160 continued: 160</strong>: AUDIENCE APPLAUDS DODGE. The
clapping is considerably sweetened by the Panthers and the rest of
Tommy’s claque. DODGE gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration. The
storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he beams on Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I thank the distinguished gentleman. And I
thank my fellow citizens. Our methods in this investigation may have
been unorthodox, but together – we have exposed a canker at the very
heart of democracy.</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: You bastard! You set me up!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Witness is out of order!</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: You stood to make a million bucks off of
me! Who offered you more? I want to know!</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: You’re as big a whore as he is!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>161 int. hospital room - day 161</strong>: The phone by Eli
Marshall’s bed RINGS. He answers.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hello? No. You’re joking. You mind if I
put on C-span?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: There’s no loyalty any more, is there,
Dick? What about the three hundred grand you squeezed from me for that
goddam voter registration front of yours – that just water under the
bridge?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: Don’t touch me, you scum!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: What about the two hundred k for your
phony foundation, Dick? How about the ten thousand copies if your goddam
autobiography you muscled me to buy – what’s all that, ancient
history?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: And you – what about those bundled checks
from my executives? I gave you my condo in Vail! I gave you my corporate
jet to fly all over the world! I gave your kids summer jobs! I put up
scholarships to put your kids through college! I hired your goddam wife
to redecorate my office! You telling me none of that counts for
anything?</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: I thought you people were for sale! I was
wrong – you’re just for rent!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: How dare you impugn my integrity! Everything
I’ve done has been completely legal!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you did all
that stuff? You took all that money?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: There’s nothing I’ve done that – – that these
gentlemen haven’t done!</p>
<p><strong>members</strong>: No!… Not me!… Just him!… I never!… He
crossed the line!</p>
<p><strong>andersen</strong>: They’re whores! All of them!</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Throw the bums out!</p>
<p><strong>tj</strong>: Damn straight! Throw the bums out! This place is
an outhouse!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Throw the bums out! Throw the bums out!</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: Tommy, enjoying the triumph,
can’t help rubbing Dodge’s nose in it.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I owed you one.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: You lowlife hustler! Who are you to talk? You
got into this House through fraud. You think I didn’t check up on
you?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I have here some rather
startling revelations about this Mr. Johnson before you. This man is
nothing but a con man!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: A common grifter! He’s wanted in three
counties for bunco! He’s a convicted swindler!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: A fugitive from justice for card sharping,
bookmaking, confidence games –</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: – and other charges the FBI has only begun to
investigate! I dare you to respond!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You know what? He’s right! But let me tell
you something – all that’s nothing, compared to what I pulled here in
Washington… and this shit’s all legit!</p>
<p><strong>162 continued: 162</strong>: LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE. Dodge
BANGS the gavel repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The gentleman is out of order! The gentleman
is out of order! This committee is adjourned!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Stop banging! Stop banging! That man has
something to say!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Adjourned? Fine. Leave. Turn your backs on
the whole country. That what you want to do, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m a con man. A small-time con man. Do you
know what it was like for me to come to Congress? It was for like dying
and going to heaven. If I did back home the kind of scams I’ve run in
Congress, my ass would be in Sing Sing. But no, I’m not a crook – up
here, I’m a distinguished gentleman!</p>
<p><strong>163 int. hospital room - day 163</strong>: Eli, watching on
television.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Now don’t get me wrong. They’re not all bums.
But boy, do the rotten fish stink up the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Now tell me, people – while these guys are
buying and selling each other, who’s standing up for you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’ll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody gets five
hundred bucks an hour to lobby for the average Joe! There’s no Shnook
PAC! There’s no National Association for Ordinary Assholes! Sure,
everyone’s against cancer, but “everyone” doesn’t have an office on K
Street! Don’t you folks get it? We’re supposed to be the people’s
lobbyists. Congress is supposed to be America’s political action
committee.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She’s right. Throw the bums out – starting
with me! I’m gonna found me a new party. The Don’t Vote For Me Party.
Any of y’all want to join up?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Well, come on, then! C’mon, get up, we got
work to do!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Throw the bums out! Throw the bums out!</p>
<p><strong>loretta</strong>: That Miss Oprah’s gonna love his ass.</p>
<p><strong>164 continued: 164</strong>: CELIA arrives where Tommy is
standing. She looks at him a beat. Then a big smile. They kiss.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: Tommy Johnson. Kamikaze congressman.</p>
<p><strong>165 ext. capitol steps - day 165</strong>: Tommy and Celia
walk down the steps, arm in arm.</p>
<p><strong>celia</strong>: I can’t wait to see that tape you made.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Why? I bought it this morning. It’s
blank.</p>
