<p><strong>sound</strong>: Crickets.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Stuck tighter’n dogshit in a deep freeze!</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Hot damn! Now… a little oil…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: It’s not bitter, not sweet… it’s a big
fuckin’ treat…</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Oh n-</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit
dreamy.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The train’s horn, MUCH CLOSER.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m going out for a while, ’kay?</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: All right. Stay close. And make sure your
brother’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will
continue to wear it through the whole movie.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: For the last ten years…</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: For the last ten years, I have had a dream. A
dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small
community, which sometimes seems so far from Durham, with her lifesaving
hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at which I see so many of my
friends gathered, will be the start of making my dream come true.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher’s
medallion, and will through the whole movie.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Lemme hold him!</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: I got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You would.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: An endeavor like this seems to me to be the
very definition of community - all of us pulling together as one,
farmers and merchants… Protestants and Catholics…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It was just a blacksnake, Jane-</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look at my knees! Look at my dress! I hate
you!</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Did wittle Janie make wee-wee in her
teddies?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Stop it, Brady.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Ooooh, naughty!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jane, I’m sorry. It was just a joke. We
didn’t mean-</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, no! You never mean to! I hate you, you
booger!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Oh, shut up, Brady. You’re warped.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Stella? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Who’s going away?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: What am I going to tell my mother? If he
won’t marry me, what am I going to tell my mother?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Oh, leave me alone! Just leave me alone, you
stupid thing!</p>
<p><strong>o’banion</strong>: Let us pray.</p>
<p><strong>o’banion</strong>: May the Grace of God shine upon those
gathered here… and lift them up… and grant success to the endeavor to
which they have so openheartedly declared their support. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: I want you two to bury the hatchet. You’re
being very silly, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jane, I-</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: I think you’re being mean as well as silly.
Your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You always take his side because he’s a
cripple! Well, it’s not my fault that he’s a cripple!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come on, Jane- it was Brady’s idea. I
couldn’t stop him.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Brady’s a booger and so are you!</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Jane Coslaw!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They had to pick up what was left of him in a
peach basket.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, Daddy! Gross!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?
That’s what Brady said.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: If you don’t stop it I’m going to vomit. I
mean it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What’s the money for?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t want your money. You’re a booger.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It was Brady’s idea, Jane. Honest to God.
Please take the money. I want to make up.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I can get a pair of L’Eggs down at the
pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s for you, too. Uncle Al gave it to
me-</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: -but I want you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You booger!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.</p>
<p>**[note**: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the
window!]</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Suicides go to hell. Especially if they’re
pregnant. And I don’t even care.</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: Rattling foliage.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh my dear God… Stella!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Stella!…Stella!</p>
<p><strong>and your family!</strong>: At the Methodist parsonage, a ’53
Dodge pulls slowly out and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she
approaches the parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces
her.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’d they say, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: They said they’d be here by noon.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The bell rings.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Look out! Look out! It’s Madman Marty and the
Silver Bullet!</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: You glad to be back in jail, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure - I like school.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: You booger.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: That’s what my sister says, too. Pretty soon
I’m going to start checking the mirror to see if I’m turning green.</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: I gotta split - see ya, Marty… Tammy.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the
regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Glasspack. He said he’d come over sometime
this summer and we’d soup up the engine… but now I dunno. He’s getting a
divorce and he’s in the doghouse with my mother.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: For getting a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well… it is his third.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Thanks for coming with me, Marty- I was
scared to go past her house by myself.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I mean, I saw her. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I used to see her every day, and she never
knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know
how stupid that sounds, but…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: There’s something else scary.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I’ve been hearing noises in there.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What kind of noises?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Rattling. Rustling.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Rats…</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: And my dad says it’s kids. But it’s not rats
and it’s not kids. It’s-</p>
<p><strong>milt</strong>: Tammy, you get on in here and do some
dishes!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’d go out and take a look myself, but I
think the Bullet’d get stuck in the garden. It looks sorta greasy.</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: You would, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Well, it’s probably nothing. I’m just spooked
since… you know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah… but if you hear any more noises, tell
your father. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home,
Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’m always doing this! I gotta go, Tammy.</p>
<p><strong>milt</strong>: ’Bout time. Why you want to hang around that
cripple?</p>
<p><strong>tammy</strong>: I like him.</p>
<p><strong>milt</strong>: Goddamn cripples always end up on welfare.
Ought to electrocute all of ’em. Balance the fucking budget.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Well, Marty! I see you lucked out again!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yep. Would you fill it up, please,
Mr. Cutts?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Want me to check the oil?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Wipe the windshield an check the driver’s
bullshit level?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay, okay. I call.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Ralph Houk! You can’t bet a manager! Stone
the crows!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Come on, Marty- bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom-!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Let the boy finish the game, Nan.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Make it quick.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Three kings.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Bullshit luck!</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: I don’t want you drinking around Marty. That’s
too much. If you can’t stop it, you better stay away.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I come here because Marty needs a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Yes… you’ve always been that to him. But if you
can’t leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just
stay away.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What do you expect, when he comes in smelling
like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He’s okay, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yes. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Let me help you up.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Jane, have you been teasing your brother
again?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: She wasn’t, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush and
fell over when I tried to get it. Jane helped pick me up.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Jane Coslaw!</p>
<p><strong>milt</strong>: Let’s see if you want to come back and break
my pots all to shit after I put some rock salt in your asses!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sturmfuller</strong>: Tammy, where’s your father?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.</p>
<p><strong>information leading to the capture of the man</strong>: WHO
KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at the bottom:
TARKER’S MILLS CITIZENS’ COMMITTEE.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: But the woman’s bed was ripped right down
the middle, Elmer- it’s take a chainsaw to do something like that!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Damn straight!</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Shut up, Porter. What about the tracks?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: That could be something to throw off the
cops. And it ain’t animals that try to confues the law; it’s people do
that.</p>
<p><strong>andy fairton</strong>: Law around here don’t need much
confusing.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to
take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside
out. I pay Joe Haller’s salary to keep the people in this town safe, and
he ain’t doing it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What are you, trying to be smart?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: You guys turn down the thermostat or I’m gonna
turn you all out. Now who’s drinking?</p>
<p><strong>brady</strong>: Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Marty Coslaw, you get down out of that
tree!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Push the Bullet over, Jane, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: They both are. At me, for not getting you
sooner. I ought to let you fall.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Come on, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Jesus wept.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You heard what I said, motormouth.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Brady!</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Get out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Stay off the bandstand, Herb.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Is it my boy? Is it Brady?</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Don’t go up-</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Br-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Joe, is it-</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is it the Kicaid b-</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What the fuck is going on h-</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again.
The men flinch back. HALLER doesn’t look up. Now, from the darkness on
the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back further,
looking more uneasy than ever.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: We’ll bury his shoes because his feet are
still in them and they’re the only part of him that makes sense
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: It’s gonna be the cheapest funeral this town
ever saw!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn,
“Bringing In The Sheaves.”</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be
no mass said here this afternoon. There will be a requiem mass for Brady
Kincaid this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you, if
I could.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: If there is any word of comfort I can give
you, it’s just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the
time of the beast always passes.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: If there are times when we feel alone and
afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when
we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. To our
neighbors. To our community. To our love for each other. I alone cannot
ease the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can I ease your pain, nor
you ease mine. But if I believe anything it’s this: we can comfort each
other. We can heal each other. We can go on together.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: The Bible tells us not to fear the terror that
creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do… we do.
Because there is much we don’t know, and we feel very small. But we must
not be alone. We must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the
wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to each other. Join hands in your
sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes
known. The time of the beast always passes. Let us pray.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You all right, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: There’s a saying- so-and-so was better
than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Well, I’m not sure that was. Christ! They
better get the guy.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uncle Al, what if it’s not a guy?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What if it’s some kind of monster?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s going on at Owen’s, Uncle Al?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: A bunch of men getting ready to pretend
they’re Clint Eastwood… Marty, didn’t anybody ever tell you that the
only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Tammy said she’d been hearing noises in that
greenhouse. Growling noises, like a big animal. Her father was killed
that night.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Marty, you have to get this idea out of
your head. Psychotics are more active when the moon is full, and this
guy is a psycho. He’s going to turn out to be as human as you or me. In
a manner of speaking. Now let’s get you inside.</p>
<p><strong>andy fairton</strong>: Okay, you all know what group you’re
in and what area you’ll be covering, right?</p>
<p><strong>porter zinneman</strong>: Damn straight!</p>
<p><strong>elmer zinneman</strong>: Shut up, Porter.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Groups one through four are in the woods north
of the Sturmfuller place. Five and six west of Carson Creek.</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Shut up, Porter.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Just remember, it’s the psycho we want, not
each other. So look before you-</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: I want all of you folks to go home!</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: I can’t remember deputizing a single one of
you!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s right, Joe- the only deputy you got is
that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one of you has done a damn
thing about solving this case.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You couldn’t catch a cold.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: The law has a name for what you men are
planning. It’s private justice, and private justice is about a step and
a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I’m no J. Edgar Hoover, but
I am the law in Tarker’s Mills, and I want you men to go home.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t let this guy scare you! What’s he done
since this thing started but hang his face out?</p>
<p><strong>owen knopfler</strong>: Ah, shut up, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t tell me to-</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Yes. Correct. Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Herb…I know how upset- how grief-stricken
you must be…but-</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Yes. Yes, but-</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: My son was torn to pieces! You come in here
and talk to these men about private justice. You dare to do that.
Constable Haller, why don’t you go out to Harmony Hill and dig up what’s
left of Brady and explain to him about private justice. Would you want
to do that?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: No. I thought not. You folks stay here if you
want. I wouldn’t ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his
conscience. As for me… I’m going out and hunt up a little private
justice.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Billy… Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can…</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Let them go.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: This is that spirit of community you were
talking about. Grand, ain’t it? Maybe they’ll shoot a hitchhiker or
something and Andy can mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit the
Medcu van, of course.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: But can’t we do anything?</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of
them get killed.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, it’s about frigging time! They’ll have
his hide tacked to somebody’s barn door before we get out there!</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Help me Porter, goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Don’t pull me! You want to rip the right
cheek of my ass right off?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Well, Elmer, there are folks that’d say
you’ve been half-assed most of your-</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Are you going to unhook me or be a wise
guy?</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Jesus, that was close. Uh, pardon me,
Rev’runt.</p>
<p><strong>o’banion</strong>: Come on. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY
CHOMP.</p>
<p><strong>virgil</strong>: Rev’runt! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>o’banion</strong>: Get it off me! Get it off me!</p>
<p><strong>bobby robertson</strong>: As far as I could tell, it could
have come from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ll spread out in a skirmish line. If the
bastard tries to go around us, we’ll hear him.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I dunno-</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think Bobby Robertson here’s making
lemonade in his pants. That lemonade got ice cubes in it, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. Spread out on me. Five feet apart.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: No- it’s behind us. I told you you couldn’t
trust-</p>
<p><strong>aspinall</strong>: It isn’t on either side.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What are you-</p>
<p><strong>aspinall</strong>: It’s under the fog. It’s right in with
us.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: SNARLING…AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is
served.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Come on, then! You want to rock and roll with
me?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Come on, come on! You want to do the bop? I’ll
bop you, motherfucker! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be
no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of
comfort to you if I could.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: There is no comfort, Father. Only private
justice.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Uh, if there’s any word of comfort I can give
you, it’s just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the
time-</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: The time… the time of the beast always passes.
There are answers… ways… ways to… to cope… if we turn to each other…</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of
kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve…</p>
<p><strong>rev. lowe</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sturmfuller and all</strong>: Won’t you try, won’t you
buy…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah… but what are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: Putting on my Sherlock Holmes deerstalker
cap, I deduce that they are leaving.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: She’s not the only one. Lot of people
leaving town. And I guess if we want a beer, we’ll have to drink it at
home.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Joe, what’s wrong with you? I ain’t never seen
you like this.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: It was the Kincaid boy. I looked at him… and
I felt it happen. It was no big deal. No worse than pissing down your
own leg. You ever do that? Maybe when you were real scared?</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: One minute I had me some guts- as much as
the next man, anyhow- and then, poof. Gone.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Joe… you are going to feel better than this.
This… this feeling of yours… it’s gonna pass…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>nan coslaw</strong>: Stop it, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, I don’t see why everybody just about
breaks down and cries whenever he-</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Stop it, your mother said.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It isn’t enough that the monster killed all
those people- that he killed Brady. Now he’s got them to cancel the
fair.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: And the fireworks. Hand me that box,
Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that’s
all I’m mad about, but it’s not. Them doing that is just a… a…</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: It’s just an outward symbol of everything
that’s inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood
Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well… I like it that you always know how to
say things, Uncle Al.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I’ll give you the telephone numbers of my
ex-wives, dear boy- they’ll be interested to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t call me dear boy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: But you are, you know- you are my dear
boy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Your mom’s not around, is she?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: She and dad are out back lighting the
barbecue. Jane’s walking around like she’s King Shit of Turd Mountain.
Like always.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would
be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: The guy killed your best friend, drove
your girl out of town, and stole the second-best holiday in the year.
Have I got it right?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like
that… but I got something that just might cheer you up.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those
pliars.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: All is cool, Marty-boy. Go for it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Jesus! Not too much!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You got a pilot’s license, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Do I need one?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: We’re gonna find out. Take it down the
road a ways and back. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I’m
dying. I hope you’re happy, because you are looking at a dying man.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: It goes fast, all right- and if your
mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing
soprano with the Vienna Boys’ Choir.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I don’t get you.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I know you don’t. But I want this to be
our secret. You get that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I’ve got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful
time.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: So have I, actually… I wish it could always be
like this.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: See me around to my car, Marty, and make
sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Now I said I had something for you, as I
believe you will recall.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You’re gonna have the Fourth of July in
October, Marty. Just don’t blow your head off. And remember that it
isn’t just the fireworks. It’s because no crazy shithead should be able
to stop the good guys, if you can dig that.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Stay near the house, for Christ’s sake-
someone’s killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this,
you know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah, I know. It’s great!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is
that you’re almost as crazy as I am. Please don’t set off anything that
goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the
difference?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah… sure.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Save this one for last.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: A tracer. You’ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Thanks a million, Uncle Al!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You’re welcome a million, Marty. Stick ’em
in the bushes for now.</p>
<p><strong>distant sound</strong>: The Bullet’s engine.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Fast-rushing water.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The Silver Bullet approaching.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Growling.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Hurt, angry growl.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Is someone there?</p>
<p>****: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is not a
full-moon period. I’ve been going on the assumption that the guy kind of
works his way up to full wolfiness, toothiness, hairiness, etc.,
starting with a partial change at about the second quarter. It’s a
process like the tide coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY’S attacker
clearly at this</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You dreamed it, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: There are no such things as werewolves.
Please, dear boy, have some pity.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Obscene phone caller. Go back to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Marty? You okay? You’ve just been sitting here
all morning.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Went shopping. Why?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jane, I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I need you to help me. Uncle Al won’t believe
me, and if you won’t help me, I…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thayer</strong>: Jane?</p>
<p><strong>mr. thayer</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thayer</strong>: Jane Coslaw.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi, Mr. Thayer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. thayer</strong>: Hello, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thayer</strong>: Bring your cart around to the back,
Jane- we’ll look in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m going to bring in a monster load of
bottles in an hour or so!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know what you’re after, Jane, and you’re
out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in yesterday, and I gave ’em all
to him.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh… okay.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: That you, Mr. Fairton?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: ’Bye, Mr. McClaren.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Father Lowe! I’m ready to turn in my bottles
and cans!</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Take your cart around to the garage and
unload, Jane! Then bring me your tally sheet!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Father Lowe?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Father Lowe?… I’ve got my tally sheet…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I… I don’t feel so well, I guess maybe I got
too much sun.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Would you like to come in the parlor and lie
down for a bit? Or have a cold drink? I have some soda-</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No! That is, I have to get home and help my
mom with lunch.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: I’ll give you a ride!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No- she… she was going to meet me at the
market. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Give my best to your brother, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I ran faster than I ever ran in my life- what
do you think, dummox? By the time I got back here, I really thought I
was going to faint. What are we going to do, Marty? If we tried to tell
anybody- grown-ups, I mean- they’d laugh. What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>:
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Uncle Al-</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now
he’s wearing an eye-patch!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I called Peltzer on my way over here,
Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of
otic solution. That’s a fancy way of saying eyewash. He’s got a corneal
inflammation.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Was it a prescription?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: What the hell does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It wasn’t- I’ll bet you it wasn’t. Because to
get a prescription he’d have to see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Marty, Marty, you should hear
yourself!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Well… was it a prescription?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I don’t know. But I know you didn’t see
any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that’s all. An
extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what’s been happening in
this town.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his
shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler!
He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade!
Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You want to know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No- we just got you out here so we could
admire your pretty face.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a
hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: No thank you, Jane. I’m a little old for
palying the Hardy Boys Meet the Catholic Werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Never mind, Jane. He’ll have gotten rid of it
by now anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why
hasn’t he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell
him Marty’s sending poison-pen letters?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I don’t accept the idea that he knows who
his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don’t accept the idea that there
was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why hasn’t he picked up the phone and told
Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I’ll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was
nonprescription. And I’ll bet you another quarter he hasn’t said
anything to Mr. Haller.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Marty, do you see your suspect?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Do you really think that a man who took a
rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He’d
either be in the hospital… or dead.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I didn’t shoot him when he was a man. I shot
him when he was-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus.
Jane, you don’t really believe this madness, do you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know exactly what I believe. But I
know that what I saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick. I know
there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day. It
smelled like an animal’s den. And I believe in Marty. I mean- there are
times when he makes me so mad I could kill him, but I still believe in
him. You used to believe in him, too, Uncle Al.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Kids!</p>
<p><strong>outfielder</strong>: You comin’ down to Robertson’s for a
soda, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No- I guess I’ll go home.</p>
<p><strong>outfielder</strong>: Okay- seeya!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah… seeya.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns
around.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: Oh, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Come on, baby… come on…</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: I’m very sorry about this. I don’t know if you
believe that or not, but it’s true. I would never willingly hurt a
child. You should have left me alone, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>lowe</strong>: You’re going to have a terrible accident,
Marty. You’re going to fall into the river.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible
danger.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I ran out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>elmer</strong>: Spooky in there, ennit?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Well… it’s a lot easier to swallow without
the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It
was counter brand. No prescription needed.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I told you!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Shut up, dear boy- no gloating
allowed.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: After Marty called me with his latest
Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did. He’s had no poison-pen complaints
lodged at all.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I told you!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Shut up, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty jane</strong>: What is it? What other thing?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I probably shouldn’t tell you- you’re both
hysterical on the subject. I’m starting to feel like a guy handing out
free Arthur Murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Uncle Al, if you don’t tell me-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: No… but I found some blood, smeared on a
tree trunk in that grove.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: There! You see!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: It could have been anything, Marty.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car
and trying to run me down? You don’t think that was a dream, do you?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Lowe’s car-?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Blue. This blue.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: That’s just about the craziest damn story
I’ve ever heard, Al.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I know. I could have edited out all of the
completely crazy stuff, but I thought you deserved to hear it with the
bark on.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: I appreciate that. Now, the next question:
Do you believe any of this? You do, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Let’s just say I believe Lester Lowe
should be checked out.</p>
<p><strong>haller</strong>: That can be arranged.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of
about nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum scrap
heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and werewolf, and quite
clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In one hand he holds the remains of
OWEN KNOPFLER’S peacemaker.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Mr. Haller said he’d check him out, and guess
what? No one sees him again!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: And what do you suggest I do about it,
dear boy?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I want you to turn this into a silver
bullet.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: You’re not going to let it go, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I saw what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Marty, the moon wasn’t even full!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jane… you don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Don’t tell me what I have to do and what I
don’t, booger-brains.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Will you marry me, Jane?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Would you kids mind telling me how this
guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe he doesn’t know,
either.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: No one knows how cancer begins, either- or
exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: The kid is eleven years old and already he
sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I think he’s going to come for me. Not just
because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don’t think
he’ll try again as Lowe.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Dear boy, you have gone right out of your
mind.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Will you do it?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Please, Uncle Al.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Will you?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: All right. I give up. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marty jane</strong>: All right! Thanks! Thank you, Uncle
Al!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: If either of you ever tells anyone I even
bought a piece of this story, werewolves will be the least of your
problems.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think. It’s
got a low-grain load so it won’t tumble. Should be pretty accurate.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: It’s just a gag, that’s all. What would
you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: Remember, Al… we’ll be at the Ritz-Carlton in
Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It’s Stickney and-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: And don’t open the door for any trick or
treaters even if they come!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: We won’t!</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: You kids go to bed on time! You’ve got school
tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: If you keep doing that, you’re going to
bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I’ll see her
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: I will- be good, kids.</p>
<p><strong>marty jane</strong>: ’Bye, mom! Bye, dad! We will! ’Bye!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Can I tell you kids something?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sure, Uncle Al.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: When me and sissy were kids, we were just
like you two.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Yeah? Really?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still
are. Learn from your elders, dearies.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t believe that you’d agree to leave the
kids with him. A year ago I would have laughed at the idea. You used to
almost breathe fire when Al came in the house.</p>
<p><strong>nan</strong>: He’s changed. Just this summer. Or something’s
changed him. Marty, maybe. And the drinking- I think it’s almost
stopped. Whatever it is, it’s wonderful. And they’ll be safe with him.
I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know they’ll be safe with him… but will he
get them both into bed by nine-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The National Anthem.</p>
<p><strong>announcer’s voice</strong>: This concludes WDML’s broadcast
day.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: But Uncle Al! You said-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I know what I said, Marty- but it’s ten
past one. He’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The moon’s not down yet…</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Damn near. Now I’ll sit up with this
stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed.
Go on, now, scoot.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What if I say no?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Then I’d have to kick your ass, dear boy.
Go on, now.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: If that’d gone off, it would have been the
end of our silver bullet.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: A very familiar feeling is beginning to
creep over me.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: What’s that, Uncle Al?</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: I feel like a horse’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Don’t you touch me, snotbrains!</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Jane-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Would you kids go to bed? My head’s
starting to ache.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: It’s here! It’s outside!</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: Jane, it’s just a power fai-</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Get the gun!</p>
<p><strong>werewolf</strong>: Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-</p>
<p><strong>werewolf</strong>: Bastard Marty!</p>
<p><strong>werewolf</strong>: Kill you…</p>
<p><strong>werewolf</strong>: Bastard Marty!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m all right… but Marty! Ma-</p>
<p><strong>uncle al</strong>: If it isn’t now, it will be after I pound
one of your mother’s silver candlesticks through its heart.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you all right, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: All except my legs… I don’t think I can
walk.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You’re a real booger, you know it?</p>
