<p><strong>close up</strong>: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes
2:15.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss
Fairchild. You are a rare woman who lights up the room… simply by
leaving it.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us
downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto.
No one really listens to anyone else. If you attempt it, you will see
why.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: You judge everything too severely. I
wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye
inward?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You do not wonder at all. You merely ask in
order to state your own opinion.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: We are all concerned about you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Ahh, here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: Your life does not seem to have any
direction. At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. At
35 he is too old. Now is your time to take action. Tell me, what is it
you want to DO with your life?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I do not know.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: Your ignorance cramps my conversation.
Wake up! This is your one and only life. Every man has the chance to
make a difference. DO something!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I am most grateful for your surveillance
and for your sympathy. I assure you there is no need for concern. I am
as effectual and attentive… as my position allows.</p>
<p><strong>uncle otto</strong>: Life is not position, Leopold. It is
action. I will see you downstairs promptly. In the appropriate frame of
mind.</p>
<p><strong>the valet</strong>: Go spread joy.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild.
You light up the room. I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Good evening. I do not believe I have had
the pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: …Julia Carlson.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: I’m sorry. Will you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You are not from the area, are you?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: This is my estate.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Really? Well it’s not home but it’s
much…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: The? Oh, that’s from Paris, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is a scandal nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Miss Carlson, do me the honor?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: I’m afraid I’m not much of a dancer.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Truly I would be in your debt. Any
admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: No, no. Really, I…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I suppose we really ought to sing
along.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Oh, golly.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I
hope it wasn’t too awful for you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Not at all. It was most enlightening.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: I really must be going.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I won’t hear of it.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: No, I’m quite late as it is.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I shall see you to the door…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: You’re very sweet. I had a wonderful time.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Miss Carlson?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Good God…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: What are you…? You frightened me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What sort of mechanism is this?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: It’s perfectly all right. It’s…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Listen to me. Please. Move very slowly.
Step out of the machine. Step out and I’ll explain whatever you want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What is this? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Get out of there! Get out now!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Miss Carlson… I…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Shit!!</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Everybody stay calm… Lock the front
door.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: No, no, no. You mustn’t touch him. The
consequences could be catastrophic.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: He could be hurt, or even dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: …All right. Touch him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: …But I’m stuck and it’s only a dance and he
IS the seventh Duke of Albany…</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Carlson…!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Give me a minute…</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Who’s upset? People fall in love, they have to
climb back out. So, what? We’ll just be friends now, Right?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I see. Well I appreciate your honesty.
No. I’ll just think of this as surviving another dating accident. Take
care or good luck or whatever I’m supposed to…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …say… Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: She’s back.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s impossible! She wasn’t supposed to
return until…</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Kate. It’s Carlson. Something went
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …The 7th Duke…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …of Albany. He was the… IS the son of Emery
and Eliza. He was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn
of the century without a trace. It was a sensation. In the 30’s they
even made a movie about him. “The Tenuous Duke” with Ronald Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: I love Ronald Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Despite much speculation and a nation wide
investigation, a body was never found. He was never heard from
again.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Until now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: We’ve altered the course of history.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: We never should have started this…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: What are we going to do? We can’t keep
him here. Imagine if anyone found out!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, no one
would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would
believe any of this is possible. So. We fix this. We keep this to
ourselves and we fix it. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st priority:
Locate Carlson. Drake, determine the reciprocal correlation’s connected
to the 19th century. Work 24 hours a day if necessary. In the meantime…
one of us will have to take charge of him.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: This is a major scientific opportunity. It
doesn’t get any better than this. Imagine. Researching the behavior, the
physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! Utilizing
technology available to us today… He’s a gold mine!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: He’s a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And while he’s here, he’s ours. Any
volunteers?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: We’ll draw names. Whoever is is picked
will be responsible. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: You’ll look after him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: No, I meant I’ll pick the name.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Where…? What has happened?!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Your Grace… Um… Hello… Weee aaare a smaaall
part of a laaarge research team. A project funded by the government of
the United States.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: appearance with</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes, um… For the past six and a half years
we’ve been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility
in the dimensions of time and space.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Yes, uh… Quite by accident we came upon a
formula utilizing Tachyons… particles traveling faster than the speed of
light, which allowed us to… fold time so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Yes. Bend it between the cracks of the
dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Now, while that wasn’t the original
purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on
our own.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Borrowing funds already provided.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We journeyed to your time because it was the
quickest path to follow. We debated long and hard whether we should use
this knowledge at all. Believe me, it was never our intent to disturb
the past…</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Merely to discover if the expedition were
possible. As your presence here confirms… we are very disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: The problem facing us is not only HOW
to get you back, but WHEN, you see?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We certainly don’t want to miscalculate. Send
you to a different era entirely.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Rest assured, no harm will come to you.
You’ll be well looked after by Dr. Coles.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles…? I do not follow. What do you
mean, get me back home?… Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Answer me!… Would you have me believe… I am
being detained, at present in the HEREAFTER?… The time to come?</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: It is the year nineteen hundred and
ninety-five.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: …19…?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You’re insane! All of you! This is
impossible!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Leopold, calm down!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A voyage through time! What do you take me
for? Did you bring me here by force?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: We’re scientist, not seditionists.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Let me out of here! I won’t stand for this
another moment!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, wait!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: You don’t know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Just listen to what we have to say!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: 19…?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Squab.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Squab?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I remember reading they ate a lot of
squab.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Squab… Do you have a squab?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Pull yourself together! Are you all right
back there?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re going to be fine you know. There’s
nothing to worry about. I have everything under control.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We’ll never get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How are you feeling? I thought you might like
some tea.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I insist on being returned home
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I understand. We’re doing our best.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I wish to speak with your employer,
Dr. Coles.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re speaking to him.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You are not suggesting that you are
Dr. Coles?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Miss… uh?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dr. Coles. If you like, you could call me Miss
Dr. Coles or if that’s too much, how about just plain Kate?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A WOMAN of science?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hard to believe?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: But a woman’s brain cannot obtain enough
knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Interesting. Nevertheless, we’ve come a long
way baby.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Are you attempting to be humorous?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m attempting to be informative it’s just
coming out humorous.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Look, modern social science clearly states
that a woman’s place in society marks the level of that civilization. A
science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a… a…
waitress. Cream and sugar?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Young lady, I… Surely it is not expected
that I remain here with you indefinitely… Unchaperoned?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Does that make you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Certainly not!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Then what are you getting so red about? It’s a
very large apartment… with locks on all the doors.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The idea! My dear Miss Coles…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dr. Coles.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Honey…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Let’s get one thing straight right now. My
name is Kate or Katherine or if you insist Dr. Coles. Take a good long
look, Leopold. I am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a
commission and independence. I am not your “young lady” or your “pretty
Miss” or your “honey.” Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Honey… For the tea.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …I’ll get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Thank you… Has it been decided what it is I
am to do while I am being held here?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, a little
light housework…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I took the liberty of preparing a simple
schedule to efficiently utilize your time while incorporating you into
my routine. As you can see, my day begins with meditation and yoga from
6:30 to 7:00.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: YOU will arise at 6:45, shower and change and
at 7:15, we breakfast together. 7:45 we begin the days work. At 10:45
Dr. Kau arrives to observe you in your natural routine as I research the
data that will enable you to return home. At 1:15 we lunch together.
2:15 you answer a daily questionnaire, I type up my notes. At precisely
6:15 you will enjoy 15 minutes of FREE TIME, then, at 6:30, I listen to
Tom Brokaw while making dinner as YOU write down any questions that come
up during your day. At 7:00, we dine together. If you need me at any
time you may ring this bell.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Now, Mondays and Wednesdays I have computer
science class, Tuesdays I have therapy. IF I have a date, I’m usually
home by 9:15. During these periods you may read any of the books I’ve
picked out for you in your room. I organize my next days work at 10:30,
11:35, David Letterman, 12:40 I’m in bed. Next day we begin again.
Simple?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: …At what time shall I WEE and POOH?</p>
<p><strong>charlie’s voice</strong>: Kate? I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh. Yes. Our chaperone is here.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Sort of. My brother.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Visiting?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: For the past two years. Charlie can never know
about this project. We’ll tell him you are a… overly distinguished
colleague staying here as our guest. From Canada. Which would explain
your lack of familiarity with our customs and so forth</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Make yourself comfortable. I’ll check in on
you later. I think this is going very well, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Okay. If you need anything, just ring.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Come here I wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: from the table, setting it on a</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You were against it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Correct. You’re back early.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey!… Are you all right? You look
funny.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Funny ha ha or funny odd?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That all depends. How was your trip?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: If it was good I’ll tell you the truth. If it
was rotten I’ll have to butter you up first.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Butter me up.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Have you been working out? No, I’m really
starting to see results. Are you comfortable there on the couch?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Very.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Good. Cause you’ll be sleeping there the next
few nights.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You have to be out of here by 8 and you can’t
be back before 6. We have an important man working with us with very
unusual needs. The company is insisting he stay here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What about a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: This man requires around the clock
attention.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I meant for me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you, Charlie. I owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You owe me nine. What am I supposed to do
all day?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You could get a job!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate, the entire point of being an artist
is that I don’t have to work. Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well, I can’t tell you much because…</p>
<p><strong>kate and charlie</strong>: I’m not allowed to discuss what
goes on at the office.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well I’m not. Anyway, it might be interesting
to have someone else to talk to. It gets so quiet around here sometimes
I feel like I’ve gone deaf.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Does he have a label?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his name?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s exactly like his name.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then you owe me ten.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Horrible!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s from Canada…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s called Hamburger Helper.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is beyond help. Please serve the next
course.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m afraid there is no next course. If you
make a list of the foods you like, I’ll pick them up at the store for
you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is all food here this… textured?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mine’s good.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Please understand, I am used to a different
sort of preparation. Where I come from a proper meal is the result of
reflection and study. A recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent
cook can plan each time with variation.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Several courses are served. Menus are often
prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the
culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In Canada?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: In Canada.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We have a saying here. “Shake and shake the
catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot’ll.”</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: How interesting.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Since you’re such an expert on fine
cuisine, why don’t you make dinner tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It should be obvious to you that I am NOT a
domestic. You may take my plate.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I have my own, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Charlie…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who died and made me Cinderella?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Young man, there is a distinct impertinence
to your voice.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s part of my charm.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Suppress it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold… Since you’re our guest here, there
are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie has season
tickets to the ball game. Perhaps you’d like to take that in?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What is it??</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Or the Opera or the Ballet?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What is it??</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Charlie, there’s no rule that says everyone
has to be interested in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, but I believe there is a rule that says
everyone has to have HEARD of it.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles, your brother Charles attitude
and demeanor are unacceptable. If I am to stay on here you must have a
serious talk with him regarding respect and civility.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: CHARLES, could you help me with the dessert in
the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: IN the kitchen. Excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t believe this guy!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Try to be nice to him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m always NICE!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Please Charlie, as a favor to me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He gives me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s different that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What was that crack about domestics?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Charlie, this is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re not going out with him, are you?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I’m not a lost
cause.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate, this is me. I’ve seen the guys you
bring home.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’ve done countless favors for you! Now I’m
asking for just one little thing…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, all right! All right! All right!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We forgot the dessert.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know,… I don’t know if I mentioned it…
but that is one fine looking suit.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What is it, Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I cannot seem to find the tea…</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Leopold’s hand rings a bell with
irritation.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No… No… No. Good God, no!… Perhaps…</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Leopold rings his bell.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, your time is up! What’s he got, a
girl in there?</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens.
He discovers the clapper has been stolen.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I should like to read about modern currency
during my bath tonight. See that the tub and basin are scrubbed up.
Remnants remain of this afternoons shave.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: In our last session you intimated there was a
symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning
your era. I found this particularly intriguing If I can just find it in
my notes…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The fire brigade!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: This is insufferable! I refuse to be spied
upon, skipped over, or shuffled about any longer. I have yet to venture
outside this cell. Before I go mad a more suitable arrangement must be
found.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Found it.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A resolution?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No I meant I found my notes.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles! Changes are in order.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Miss Coles, as we are to remain here
together, there are certain conditions I insist are met and maintained.
I no longer wish to be peeped at, mocked…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I never…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Or interrupted. Jot this down. Breakfast at
12. Luncheon at 4. Diner at 8. A horse should be made available from 1
to 3.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A horse? In New York City?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about your
style of dress. I do not care for it. I cannot believe it is the
prevailing taste for women to appear masculine and unkempt. If this is
the fashion, have it altered.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: That is all for the present.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: CRUMBS, my dear!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted with many
women in my time, yet I am compelled to say that the modern woman is by
far the least attractive I have ever encountered.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And I have a news flash of my own.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You sir, are no Ronald Coleman!</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough
Swirl or Peach?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Peach.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No information
exists detailing what happened to Carlson. I’ve been working for weeks
and I’m not any closer than when I began… How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: My cholesterol level is up 70 points.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Thank you, Kate… How’re you managing with
Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Fine. Fine… Why? What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Nothing. I was just asking.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh. Well, it’s fine. He’s a delight.
Everything’s under control.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Keep up the good work. She seemed a little
scattered. Do you think everything’s all right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Katherine Coles is the most capable
person we have on this project. If anyone can handle the delicacy of
this situation, Kate can.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: So there’s nothing to worry about?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>gone? gone where?!</strong>: Charlie we’ve got to find
him!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: STERN portrait of</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: When did he leave?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know. An hour ago? He said he
wanted to take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And you let him?? He’s not allowed to go
outside!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is he being punished?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We’ve got to find him! You stay here in case
he finds his way back. And while you wait you’d better pray he’s all
right. If anything happens to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING we’ve
worked for will have been destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And YOU’LL be responsible. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s the big deal? Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold… is not really from Canada.</p>
<p><strong>woman motorist</strong>: You stupid fucking son of a bitch.
Next time I’ll hit ya. Fucking moron.</p>
<p><strong>cabby</strong>: What’re ya waiting for lady? An
invitation?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m sorry! I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: You gotta problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It seems rather pricey to me.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: So don’t buy one.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I shan’t.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: So shan’t!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes, I… I would be happy to sample one
however I’m afraid I haven’t the finance with me just now. If I could
establish a credit with you, I will have someone come round with the
funds tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a
hamburger today, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I believe so. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Get the fuck outta here.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Get out. Fuckin’ Wimpys piss me
off.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: May I remind you, merchant, that I am the
customer in this establishment and as such require your attention and
the utmost respect. I do not accept this modern convention of
desecrating one’s patrons with such contemptuous disregard.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie woman</strong>: You tell him.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Need I add that without our patronage you
would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Where do you get off? You don’t even
have any money.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Don’t be irrelevant… I’m browsing.</p>
<p><strong>counter man</strong>: Not in my store you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Do you intend to physically escort me
out…?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Did you see what he did? Did you see
that?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold! Leopold, get in.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: trying to dry him</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t you ever go out again without my
permission, do you hear me? I was frantic. You could have been killed a
hundred times over. I never would have known.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: her eyes for the</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Okay. I’ll get you home in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No… I wish to go home.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I don’t know. It’s just Leopold. Like Cher.
Or Goofy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. You
look horrible.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Charlie, don’t start. I haven’t been this
angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. If you
make a wisecrack I’m going to burst into flame.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It wasn’t a wisecrack. You do look
horrible.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m too tired for this now. I’ll just save it
up and kill you tomorrow. Help Leopold out of his things and lets get
him to bed.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’ve something to say. To the both of you.
I… Nothing is what it seems. After witnessing mere weeks of this age it
is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance… I don’t know how
to proceed. I frankly… am in need of assistance. I’m sorry. I’m not very
good at this. In the event you have missed it, I am apologizing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: About time. Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t mind him. His heart would be in the
right place if he had a heart. Surliness runs in my family.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I understand. It practically races through
mine.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one that’s
not at my expense. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: We’d better get to bed… That is…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes… I start work… in three and a half
hours.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s fine. I’m used to it.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You mustn’t get too used to it. You’ll find
life passes you by awfully quickly.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Thank you for…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Well, goodnight then.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold?… I don’t have a clear handle on this.
Perhaps I was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time.
I don’t know when you’ll be able return home… Tomorrow I’ll start
preparing you for the outside world. And… We’ll find your way back. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was merely…
I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Is there something you want, Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I merely wanted to see… that is, inquire,
on your availability, for an outing… My assimilation and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us. I’ll
be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes, of course. Splendid.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Are you certain this is correct?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Certainly I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Now really. Isn’t this better?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Sorry. Oops! Careful there. So sorry.</p>
<p><strong>close ups</strong>: Leopold scrutinizing vegetables in cans,
cereals for kids, bottled water, instant soup, feminine hygiene
supplies.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Have you seen today’s paper?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Put it back.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Back!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles, why is it you are not
married?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Women are longer defined by the men they’re
married to, Leopold. I have a career. I haven’t found a man who fits in
with that yet.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yet people still marry?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’ve heard of cases.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I suspect there is something wrong with
you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with me!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Perhaps it is the way you present
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: There is some sort of problem when a woman
reaches thirty and insists on remaining single.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You think I’m THIRTY?!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do I look THIRTY to you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It was an arbitrary number.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You chose it specifically opposed to a lower
number.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I didn’t mean it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …Thirty!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I apologize… How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m thirty! But you’re the first person
whoever told me I looked it!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And it’s not that I insist on remaining
single. Believe me. Everyone dreams of finding somebody to share their
life with. To give someone all the love they’ve been hoarding since they
were a kid. I’m no different. But one has to be sensible. I have a
career and a life that’s filled with…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Not again…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What do I have to do? Put a leash around your
neck?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: She is the woman to whom I was referring.
You see the problem?</p>
<p><strong>saleslady</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: clothes then back at</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: This is ridiculous. I don’t have time to… Do
you know what this dress costs? Let’s get this over with. I’m coming
out. Nobody laugh.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You have a lovely face.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: We’ll take the dress.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: The drug of the 20th century.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, your dinner’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s a guy thing.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …Now within that astronomical structure,
Dr. Drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the
present. He’ll find it too if his arteries don’t harden first.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Astounding.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Once that is discovered, the search begins for
the exact time and date travel will be possible.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: How are you proceeding?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t take it personally. Once Dr. Kau starts
working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down. We’re all
pretty much like that.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The complexity of this equation is
astonishing? Can you really comprehend all that?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m a genius.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You’re quite exceptional Dr. Coles. That is
to say, you all are.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you. And may I say that sometimes, in
DIM light, you’re not so bad yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh my God! Is that the time? I’m late.
Therapy. Every Tuesday night.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: May I accompany you?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You mayn’t.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I am not certain I understand therapy.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No one does. That’s why therapists can charge
so much.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What exactly transpires during therapy?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold. A gentleman does not ask those
questions. Come on, we’ll get you home.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I am perfectly able to travel homeward
myself.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Really! I have finance and our address. I
shall take a cabbie.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You are late. I insist. I am NOT a child.
Dr. Coles.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: All right. Don’t bite my head off.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I can’t seem to…</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Oh, for heaven’s sake…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pincus</strong>: I was worried. I thought you weren’t
going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Miss my lesson? This is the only thing I have
to look forward to all week. Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: All right, kids. Pair up!</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Don’t think so much, Katie. FEEL the
music.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I am!</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Dancing should not be work. It should be
a vacation the body takes from the mind. Let the music wash over
you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It is!</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Repeat after me: I’ve got the muusic in
me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’ve got the muusic in me.</p>
<p><strong>instructor &amp; kate</strong>: I’ve got the muusic in
me!</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Keep telling yourself that.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: I’ve located her.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: You didn’t! Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: No. She’s really not.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: It was taken a year after she arrived. Look
at her face! We have to get her back.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Christine, this morning I spoke with
the head of funding. They’re talking about canceling the project.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: What?! They can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: There’s still time. Nothing has
happened yet that can’t be undone. We’ll get her back. We’ll put this
behind us and we’ll get her back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Is there something on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: This is rather difficult for me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Uh huh…?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I have been in the salon contemplating the
reception I have received by the various tradesmen I have visited. I’ve
determined I am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Of what??</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Social skills.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I realize our association has been rather
distant and I bear you no ill will.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You can imagine my relief.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The fact is… I need help.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not ask Kate?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I would appreciate the masculine point of
view.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not ask Kate?… That was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well? Let’s see… I guess we could start by
removing that great big stick from up your… Let’s start with your
walk.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: My walk?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t walk right. You strut.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Strut strut strut. You walk into the
bathroom it’s like I’m watching a parade. Walk across the room.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will not.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know you won’t. You’ll STRUT. You asked
for my help. Trust me on this.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: That’s enough! Really! You walk.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See? Easy. Relaxed. You try.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s better. Now, try to enjoy your walk.
It’s a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the peasants are singing.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Charlie and Leopold joyously singing The
Stars and Stripes. As the song builds:</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Interesting?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Leopold, are you wearing a corset?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Naturally.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’d ya say was the name of this
number?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Tchaikovsky. Waltz of the Flowers.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Pretty.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Megadeath. High Speed Dirt.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What in the world…?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sorry! We’re so sorry. Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: She’s another Babe Ruth. We had no idea. Are
you okay?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What do you have to say for yourself,
Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is this your child?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: C’mon honey, lets go.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I want my ball.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Just a moment! Pick a hand.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: My mother’s name was Elizabeth. She’s a
beautiful child. You’re very lucky.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What do you say, Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I understand pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and
pot pies. But I wish someone would explain Eskimo pies.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You smoke Camel’s, you wear Old Spices, and
you drink Mountains Dew. It’s revolting. The pudding tonight is
excellent. Another thing I’ve noticed, everyone is in a great rush
today. Instant Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, Minute Maid. You’ll
find there’s much to be said for moderation and languor.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Mmmm. Is it tapioca?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s margarine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It’s marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I’m off.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Me too. Work to do. Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m meeting everyone over at Caffeine. It’s
this coffee house we go to.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Say hello to Dennis for me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Dennis is this really good looking friend
of mine who doesn’t know Kate’s alive because SHE doesn’t know how to
flirt.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: As a rule I don’t like to associate with
really good looking people. It makes me feel really… I don’t know…
Smart. But Dennis is a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And he always picks up the check.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s a wonderful idea! Leopold mentioned how
he wanted to meet… People of quality was it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ahhhhh?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: If you’d rather I didn’t go…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Nonsense! Charlie, you don’t want to hurt
Leopold’s feelings. He’s going to think you don’t want him to go.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh it’s not that. It’s just that it’s sort
of a vulgar crowd, is all. I’m not sure you’d have such a good time.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A little ribald humor? I’m not as big a
stick in the mud as you might think! I’d enjoy a gay night out, kicking
up my heels.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Finish off your Parquet and we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There they all are. Now one more thing.
Throw the words “like” and “you know” into a sentence whenever possible.
It’s how people talk today.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Proper speech does not cease to exist
simply because it is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Please?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Charles, you needn’t fret. I have the walk
down pat. I will not give myself away. Like.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh shit! Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Patrice. See that girl? The blonde one?
She’s so inconceivably hot.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: She’s very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ok not exactly mine. But I saw her
first.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay. I guess we should go in. I don’t
suppose we could tell everyone you don’t speak English?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Of course not. Let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Charlie! Where’ve you been? etc.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hi. Uh everyone, this is my friend,
Leo.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Waz up?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Waz up?</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Leo’s staying with us for a while.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Thank you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Um?… …I have nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You did not tell the truth about Patrice,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What did I tell you, LEO?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: He informed me you were inconceivably HOT,
but I think you’re lovely. Exceptionally lovely.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Thank you, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Check please.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Just drop it Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I am not
interested in her.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: In any case the problem is not with me but
with you. You have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman.
From what I’ve witnessed tonight, it is symptomatic of your entire
generation.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You are some piece of work, Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Now I do not wish to get personal…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: But you have been of great assistance to me
and I feel this is one area where I can be of some real help.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m fascinated. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Now, why was I successful with this young
lady and why did you so miserably fail?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What makes you think she likes you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Well she gave me the number of her
telephone and I assumed it meant…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: As I see it, the girl hasn’t an inkling of
your intentions. And it’s no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry
Andrew.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A Merry Andrew.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I am not!!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Everything plays like a farce to you. The
more wit, the less courage. I believe the modern woman desires passion,
protection, sensitivity. No woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon.
Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort
of playfulness.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You think I should pounce?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m saying you must treat her with respect.
Any oaf can attempt a crude pass. A woman of Kate’s stature would never
respond to an artificial tactic.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You said Kate.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes you did. Didn’t he say Kate?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: We are discussing your problem.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not anymore. You like my sister.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Charles…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She has trouble with men, you know.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Perhaps she has not met the right one.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She has met the right one. HUNDREDS of
times. But she pulls back. She cuts herself off. You turn around and
suddenly you’re dating a Sphinx.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: One never can tell.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Does Kate know how you feel?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Have you made your intentions known to
her?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who’s the Merry Andrew now?! I think you’re
all talk and no action. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I do not know if there is a future in
it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well Leopold, no one ever does…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Royal family – Uncouth. Making Out – slow
soulful kissing… Woman as equals??</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Who drove the Chevy to the levy and why was it
dry?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Eyes shine when she talks about… science.
Raises her voice when she knows she’s wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, BOSSY. Lose
my train of thought when I see her smile. Most beautiful when she’s
angry. Honorable heart… Peasant feet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Ooops. Bread and butter.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Bread and butter. It’s an old saying… Well not
to you I guess. You say it when you pass someone in a cramped space. As
close as bread and butter.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So. Did you have a good time last night?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It was very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Did you find that person of quality?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes. I did.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well… fine. I guess it’s time to turn in.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hi. I brought you some flowers.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Charlie!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Miss Wochuchowski? I was wondering if you
would do me the great honor of accompanying me to the cinema tonight.
And allowing me the privilege of escorting you to dinner afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Gracing me with your conversation and
company would mean the world to me.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Um… 7:00?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: 7:00 is fine. I’ll call for you then.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Goodbye. It worked!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Of course it did.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Leopold, I… I’m… I have no idea what to do
next!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Charles. Leave everything to me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not so fast, buddy. You’re next.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Good morning. You’re up early.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m terribly sorry!!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Happens all the time…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles?… ah, Kate? I was wondering…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: What it is you’re working on.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh. It’s my computer.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see. Actually I meant the work
itself.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m researching the correlations between your
time and the present.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m TRYING to get you home, Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I have never seen a woman work as
diligently and extensively before.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s made me the man I am today.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It’s quite a beautiful day, have you
noticed? Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me
the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, I’d love to but I can’t. I’ve got too much
work to do. Ask Charlie though. He’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m afraid it really wouldn’t be the same.
It is YOUR company I am seeking.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, Leopold. I’m so sorry. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see. Some other time then.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh for crying out loud. Would you look at
this? Leopold? The computer’s on the blink again. Cheap piece of
equipment. I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Maybe if you…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: NO, no, it does this all the time. Just have
to wait it out.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Darn.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: …Perhaps it is a sign?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, you think?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I… I must have gotten a funny horse…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is that supposed to be my hair? Do you see
how they think my hair looks?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s simplicity in it’s purest form. It
speaks volumes in it’s nothingness. Whiteness representing emptiness.
Hopelessness. It’s bleak. Bleak!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Aaand this represents…?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: A painting of privileged Victorian
society.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’d almost forgotten how beautiful it was.
Truly. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: M &amp; M’s, CBS, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t know. K.D. Lang.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I don’t know how you keep up with it. I’m
exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’ll tell you what. Why don’t I prepare
dinner tomorrow night? I never have before. I mean even before I hit
town. “Hit town” How’s that? I can’t imagine what it’ll taste like, but
I don’t think it will be any worse than your cooking.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A blind date.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Oh, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No, that just means I haven’t met him before.
It was set up through friends.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A hazard of single life… I’m turning in.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Another time then.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It’s quite all right.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. I can’t
remember the last time I took the day off and just played. I’d forgotten
how beautiful this city can be… I want to thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The pleasure was mine.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. Are
you sure you can teach me everything there is to know?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Just don’t swipe the silverware and give
yourself away.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Nobody’s talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is very simple. I will be your date.
Just behave as you normally would and I’ll correct you along the way.
Now, escort me in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Pull the chair for a lady! Clod.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No name calling.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Well, really!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You’re not shoveling coal into a furnace,
Charles. Glide the chair in gently. Gently. Try it again.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Well, sit down!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now don’t burst a vein or anything, but
there are quite a few knives and forks here. How do I know what each
one’s for?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Merely start from the outside and work your
way in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What kind of beer should I order?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Beer!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You look exquisite, Katherine.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you, Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is a tie I’m wearing.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You look very nice, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That must be him.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Your bland date?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Blind date.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Remember to breathe, Kate. And don’t use to
many big words. You’ll scare the poor slob away.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: This is always the scary part. “Open the door
to my, Mystery Date.”</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hi. Kate?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Larry?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well, I’m off.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate, may I have a word with you?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes. I DON’T like the look of him.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Cad. I can spot one a mile away. I shall
escort you out myself. I will act as your chaperone.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That isn’t necessary. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is no trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Goodnight, Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So. How am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How am I doing? First date. You pleased? You
disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Undecided.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So. What did Jeannie say about me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: About you? Ah, she said you were tall.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: 6’3.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: And nice looking.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Thank her. And that you persevere ardently on
Wall Street.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well, I work there…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That must be very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’ve obviously never worked on Wall
Street.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What else did Jeannie say about me?</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Have I told you how much I liked your
painting?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Twice.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: If you get tired of hearing about it, let
me know. I have to admit I was sort of surprised when you called. I
didn’t think you liked me, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: When I first saw you, I thought…</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: What do you think now?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Aaand that’s about all Jeannie said. What did
Jeannie say about me?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She said you were enormously sexy, had a
great body, but you don’t put out.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Quite a compelling portrait.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Would you say it’s an accurate portrait?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: So this guy wants to invest $50,000 in a
stock that’s no good. Here’s what I do…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’m telling you the guy was a DICK! A total
ASSHOLE!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Jeff Murray. The guy I’ve been talking about.
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: for Leopold, smiling</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t get up.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, Leopold…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Bread and butter.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You’re back early. Did you enjoy your
date?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Here, you’ve got some…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is it gone?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A funny thing happened to me on my bland date
this evening, Leopold. I really can’t explain it. This puffed- up,
puritanical, blundering, greenhorn kept popping into my mind all night
long at the most inopportune times. I couldn’t get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: How inconsiderate.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, the more
persistent he became. He’s conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it
doesn’t seem to matter… He’s 134 years old but I can’t get him out of my
head.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is he there right now?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Right here. Larger than life.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’ll protect you…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Dr. Coles, would you grant me license to
dine with you tomorrow evening at eight o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Permission granted.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Until tomorrow, then.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: YOU do. What have you got there?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hamburger Helper!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I know you like it.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Um, where was I? So after my father died I had
to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Have you had many jobs?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Many. I got fired from all of them. I’m the
most unskilled person I know. But they were just survival jobs while I
was still in school. I always knew I wanted to go into science like my
father. And I did.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Do you miss him?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I think about him every day. He was courtly,
just like you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I think you are a remarkable woman
Katherine Coles.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You just don’t get out much. You’d be
surprised how remarkable I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No, it is you who would be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Nothing? My own mother never made me a
breakfast like this.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will have to have a talk with her.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: About last night…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Please sit down.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate, I had never before been a considerate
man. I had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting
for some incentive to force me into action. You have made me see how
rare our time here really is. I am most beholden to you Kate. And always
will be.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I sense the word “BUT” entering into this any
minute now.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Shall I take that as a “yes”?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I love you, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s entirely beside the point… You’re
moving way too fast here. Shouldn’t we date first? I mean it’s obvious
the first one went well…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Where I come from that’s pretty much the
way it works.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, even though last night we… loved each
other, that doesn’t mean this morning we’re engaged. It just doesn’t
work that way now.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: his fingers and</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh Leopold, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Relationships these days are much more
complicated than that. Women today have certain freedoms that men have
been taking advantage of for centuries. You must have been aware of
that. If you think about it clearly, it should be obvious to you that
marriage between us is out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Do you not love me Kate?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t ever think that…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Then consider my proposal.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’ll think it over but I can tell you now the
answer is…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I need you beside me. I will not give up
easily.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do what you have to do…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>leopold and kate</strong>: Morning!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I would like some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Of course. Say when.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: When.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kay</strong>: Kate, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Fine! I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Public office is apparently still the last
refuge for the incompetent. Show me a man who does not want his gun
registered and I’ll show you a man who should not own a gun. What is a
pee-pee girl?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The Village Voice. After much
consideration, I have decided it is time I join the work force.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: As a pee-pee girl?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Perhaps not that, but I am determined to
acquire honest employment.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold, I don’t know if that’s such a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate, my life back home was beneficial to
no one. I want my new life to have value. I won’t make the same mistakes
twice.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You have to be patient.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I could conceivably wait my whole life
away.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re awfully cute when you get causey.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will not waste any more time. I must make
a difference.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Try our fragrance? Would you like to try
our new fragrance today?</p>
<p><strong>rich customer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is called, POISON.</p>
<p><strong>rich customer</strong>: Oh! I don’t think so. Have you
got</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>rich customer</strong>: Elizabeth Taylor’s Passion?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Next aisle over.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Give your mother-in-law what she really
deserves this season. Give her some POISON.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hi. What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So you know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: We had to go through your computer to
access information. Your calculations have been verified and the final
course has been set. Leopold goes back a week from Friday 1:17 a.m.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: How long were you going to keep it a
secret, Kate?</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Were you even going to tell us at
all?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Not sure? What can you be thinking? You
can’t alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay. It
won’t be. He has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: He’s going back, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: No… No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There you are. I’ve only been hollering for
the last…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate? What is it? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s time. Leopold’s going back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yup. I’ll get his things together. Tell him
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t look so fine.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well I am. It was wonderful having him here,
Charlie. He was of invaluable assistance to the project. I’ll miss
him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’ll miss him?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Goddamnit Kate, you love the guy!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Kate, don’t do this. Please. It’s not
right.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What am I supposed to DO, Charlie?? I can’t go
back. He can’t stay. I can’t let him go. I’m not equipped to deal with
this, Charlie. I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Listen to me, Kate. Don’t! Don’t be the ice
princess.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You are. You can’t live your whole life
under a microscope. You’ve got to tell him how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s too much, Charlie. It’s just too
much.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You owe it to him.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I didn’t know I could feel like this. I really
didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: So I looked him right in the eye and said,
‘Ego is nature’s compensation for mediocrity.’ I turned and I walked. He
never said a word… He probably didn’t understand it… Kate?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Are you all right? You’re awfully
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: How was your day?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We’re sending you back.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: A week from Friday, early morning.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It was a mistake, Leopold. It’s out of our
hands. We can’t POCKET people from history like stolen jewels. We
haven’t the right… I’m sorry. We’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What do you want me to do, fall apart? You’d
still be leaving. It wouldn’t solve anything.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Who is this woman sitting across from
me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What do you want me to say, Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Tell me that you love me as I love you. Let
me hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will not do this. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Good God. Look at you. You look awful.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You should see what I’m looking at.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I went back to the restaurant. They told me
you went out looking for me right after I left.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That was pound cakes ago. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I had a lot to think over.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Just where I stand around here.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We should have come up with something
together. I might have been spared ten or seventy pounds.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Is that an apology?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m sorry for what I said.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes you are…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’m not going. I’m staying here with
you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: But? You can’t! We have no right to…</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: It is my destiny. It is my decision.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Have you thought about what you’d be
sacrificing? Your influence? Your authority?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Your family, your whole way of life,
everything?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re not just feeling sorry for me because I
ate the contents of the refrigerator, are you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I love you, Kate. The single most
miraculous event in my life was not how I arrived here, but that when I
did, I found you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Here comes the mushy part!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: After much consideration I’ve come to the
conclusion I no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and
ornate grounds.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That’s good, because if you’re staying I’ll
probably get fired again. What do you desire?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: A beautiful wife, a small home in the
middle of nowhere, lots of children, and fine schools with PMS meetings
every other Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I love you too. I do, Leopold. I love you,
too.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: This is outrageous! I won’t allow
it!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The decision is not yours to make.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: Do you realize what you’re saying?
You’re tampering with fate, preordinance, and God himself.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: We do that every day, doctor. It is called
CHOICE.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Dr. Carlson is still over there. You can’t
simply abandon her. We have to get her back.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do you think I’m not aware of that? Do you
think a minute goes by that I don’t feel responsible for her? But</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Only one person can return. The capsule
accommodates only one person. Leopold has to find her.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Perhaps she does not wish to return.
Perhaps she’s found greater happiness in her new life. It happened to
me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe she’s of more
important use back there.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Julia Carlson died in the Center Factory
fire of 1897, two years after she arrived. She was 37 years old.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Dear lord.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: She was a friend, Kate. She was never
expected to sacrifice her life for this experiment. I won’t be a party
to it. I know what I’m asking… There’s no way we can force you to go.
Just think it over.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re going back aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I keep seeing that poor woman’s face. She
was terrified.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You said you wouldn’t leave me… I’ve never
been lucky. Not one time.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Six months ago I wouldn’t have given it
another thought. I wouldn’t have lost a moment’s sleep. You’ve changed
me, Kate. There is no turning back.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I wouldn’t WANT you to change. That’s what’s
tearing me up inside. Either way I lose… You’ve changed me too. I can’t
go back to my old life anymore. I can’t live like that again. God my
heart is pounding like a drum. I’ve never been so scared in my life.
Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You don’t realize what you’re saying! You
don’t understand the kind of life you’d lead. What you’d be giving
up.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’d be with you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I can’t ask that of you.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Just ask me… Just ask.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Come back with me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: This is something I’ve wanted to do for a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: This will be very therapeutic.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: The time tables have been set. Just strap
yourself in and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: You have only a twenty four hour leeway
before the machine is set to return to us. You must find Carlson within
that time frame and get her on board or there will be little chance of
her finding a way back.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: It’s been a real pleasure. You have a
much nicer smile than Ronald Coleman.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: The privilege was mine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Goodbye Leopold, and thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: Don’t worry. We’ll send Kate to you… as
soon as possible. I’ll see to it myself.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: See that you do.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: You have my word on it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: Four minutes and counting.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well? I’ll make this quick. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Goodbye. I shall miss you Charles, more
than you know.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’ll miss you too, Leopold… You’re the only
one who knows how to program the VCR… Take care of my sister.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: You better. Take care of yourself too while
you’re at it… So long.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t have any words for this.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I will see you soon.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: You’ll be with me all the time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I know. I brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So you wouldn’t forget me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Kate…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So you wouldn’t think this was all a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Don’t forget about me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I love you, Kate.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: For as long as it takes.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I will come back to you! I will!</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: It’s time Leopold.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: 9 8 7 6 5 4…</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: 3 2 1!</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: I cannot in good conscience let you go.
It’s out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>dr. drake</strong>: I can’t be a part of it either Kate. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dr. kau</strong>: It’s too big a risk.</p>
<p><strong>dr. plodder</strong>: We cannot guarantee your child’s
safety. It’s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s waiting for me. I can feel it. Oh,
Leopold…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: You’re Leo aren’t you? You don’t remember
me but I knew you when you were yea big.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: I’m Julia. I’m an old friend of your
mothers.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: We had spaghetti at our house 4 times this
week.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leo you don’t have to holler like that. I’m
not deaf…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Kate?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: …Carlson?!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Carlson, I don’t believe it. It’s been… I
don’t know how many years. What are you doing here.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: I came to see you, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You remember my son, Leo?</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: We’ve just been getting acquainted.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well, come inside. Come inside.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Would you like some tea? I wish you had called
before you come over. It would have given me a chance to straighten up
the house… myself… my life. Tell me what you’ve been up to. Catch me up
on everyone. I heard you received some big endowment or something. I was
going to write, then call, but…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: It’s all right, Kate. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: You’d leave in 9 days. That’s not a lot of
time to get your affairs in order… And I warn you, it’s nearly
impossible for an intelligent woman back there.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: He’s a fine boy Kate. Leopold would be
proud. We’re aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you
deserved the option.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Who was that lady?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Just an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: What she want?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Nothing important. You brush your teeth?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed.
Good night, cookie.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: He’s so YOUNG, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s old enough.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Look at that idiotic expression on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Of course he’s happy. All weddings are happy.
It’s the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh, you’re so young… I love you, Leo. Always
remember that…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Mom, we’re only moving to Denver.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I know, cookie. I know.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What will I do without you, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Live happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Kate, it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Here. It’s a letter for my father. Tell him
about me and… um, tell him I love him. I want him to know me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Leo…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Mom, I want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>leo</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: Ready!</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: 9, 8, 7…</p>
<p><strong>carlson</strong>: 3, 2, 1!</p>
<p><strong>flirt</strong>: I just love a starched white shirt. It’s so
elegant.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>flirt</strong>: Skeeky.</p>
<p><strong>leopold</strong>: Yes. You dance like an angel Miss Beall.
You light up the room around you. I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>flirt</strong>: Thank YOU.</p>
<p><strong>lord whitehead</strong>: Who is that dancing with
Leopold?</p>
<p><strong>lady whitehead</strong>: I’ve never seen her before.</p>
