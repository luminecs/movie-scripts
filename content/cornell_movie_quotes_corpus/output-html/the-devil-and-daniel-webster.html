<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary! Ma! All ready? First bell’s
a-ringing.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Yes, we’re all ready. Mary’s just coming
down.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Now, son. Cheer up. We’re all healthy.
We’ve still got meal in the barrel. And look at that sky … … big cracks
in it like it was ice on the mill pond cracking up to show it’s spring
a-coming. If that ain’t enough for a God-fearing New Hampshire family, I
want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – help!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Down, Shep! Down!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He only wants you to throw the stick for him,
Jabez. I guess he’s feeling the spring a-coming, too.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: All right – only he needn’t dirty my
pants!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You throw mighty far, Jabez – almost into the
pigsty.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Mary – Jabez –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Coming, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What is that smile on your face? Is there
anything wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Now, Jabez! I’ve got on my Sunday bonnet and
I’m going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the
beginning of winter – and if that isn’t an occasion, I don’t know what
is.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You’re right, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: I hope we won’t be too late –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now, what the dickens –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Look at that consarn dog! Shep! Stop it!
Shep!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well, I guess we won’t be going to church
today.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I guess we won’t.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Quiet, Mr. Porker! He’s worse than a greased
pig at the county fair!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I think his leg is broken.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when
they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez, don’t you remember your own wedding? We
said it’s for better or worse. We said it’s for richer or poorer.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s what we said.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: “There was a man in the land of Uz whose
name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared
God and eschewed evil.”</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Consarn the consarn –</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the
Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Sorry, Ma – but this consar– this little pig
– He won’t let me fix him –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s stubborn as a Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hold the splint tighter – it’s almost done.
Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You know that, son.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hard luck – like me.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Now, Jabez Stone – as for what you’re
calling hard luck – well, we made New England out of it. That and
codfish.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s right, Ma – we ain’t licked yet. A
Stone’s never licked till he’s dead – that’s what Dad used to say,
didn’t he, Ma?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him
down here, by the fire, Mary. But we don’t want to get him too close –
we’ll have roast pork for supper.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Not on the Sabbath you won’t, Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Give me the book, Ma! I’m going to read us
something comforting.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That is – if you don’t mind changing the
lesson, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Land sakes, I don’t mind. I never did hold
much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me.
I don’t want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he
came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, I’ll be – there’s a rig, turning in, by
the gate.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It’s Tom Sharp and two other fellers – Oh,
glory – where’s my pants?</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Afternoon, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Afternoon, Tom. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: There’s a mat there to wipe your feet
on.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Thanks, ma’am. Howdy, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Howdy, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: This is Van Brooks – he’s
Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: This is Eli Higgins – Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: There’s a mat there to wipe your feet
on.</p>
<p><strong>third farmer</strong>: Thanks, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Come on close to the fire – Set down.</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: Little pig hurt himself?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: We don’t smoke on Sabbath in New
Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>eli higgins</strong>: Sorry, ma’am, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: How’s the year been in your part of the
country?</p>
<p><strong>eli higgins</strong>: Had a good stand of corn – coming up
right nice. Then we got a hailstorm – in June. Hailstones so mighty
chickens sat on ’em thinking they was eggs. Makes you wonder sometimes
what Providence is thinking about.</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: We got a snowstorm in August.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: In August?</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: Yes, and it was so cold – a man got
caught in it – froze him solid, all except his heart. That was frozen
already.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Loan shark – hey?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Too bad it didn’t happen to Miser
Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Are you one of old Stevens’ customers
too?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Sure am.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Yes, it’s the debt and the lien and the
mortgage that eats up the farmer!</p>
<p><strong>eli higgins</strong>: City folks, they can go bankrupt – a
farmer, he can’t crawl easy.</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: Laws ought to be changed, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Yes! We farmers ought to put through some
of our own laws at regular meetings – have a sort of Grange as they call
it in Vermont.</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: That’s why the three of us met up
together, Neighbor Stone. We’re American citizens – we’ve got a right to
get ourselves organized like city folks.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: What do you say? Sound reasonable to
you?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Sure does. But I’ll have to sleep on it a
couple of nights.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: That’s fair enough, Jabez. Man’s got a
right to mull things over. We’ll drive round again, week or so.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I am just thinkin’ – now they mightn’t like
the idea down in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Why not! There’s a bill up in Congress to
give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it
right now–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Black Dan’l?</p>
<p><strong>van brooks</strong>: Yep – the biggest man in the whole U.S.
– Senator from Massachusetts – and surely our next president.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: He was born and raised at Franklin – right
across the valley – Mary is from there, too.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He gave my father advice, many times – about
crops and politics – and it was always right.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: I’ve heard people talk a lot about his
farm at Marshfield. He’s up at five there every morning. He ain’t one of
our gentleman farmers. He knows all the ways of the land.</p>
<p><strong>eli higgins</strong>: They say, when he goes out to fish, the
trout jump out of the stream and right into his pockets, because they
know it’s no use arguing.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why, they say that when he speaks, stars and
stripes come right out in the sky….</p>
<p><strong>voice of scratch</strong>: Listen, Black Dan’l, You’re
wasting your time writing speeches like that. Why worry about the people
and their problems? Start thinking of your own. You want to be president
of this country, don’t you – and you ought to be – – Inauguration Day
parade – bands playing – horses prancing, the sun shining on the stars
and stripes waving in the breeze – crowds cheering Daniel Webster,
President of the United States of America…. Don’t be a fool. Stop
bothering with that speech and get busy promoting yourself instead of
the people.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: “The insolvent farmers cannot even come to
the seat of their Government to present their cases to Congress – so
great is their fear that some creditor will arrest them in some
intervening state –”</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: “We talk much and talk warmly of political
liberty, but who can enjoy political liberty if he is deprived
permanently of personal liberty? To those unfortunate individuals doomed
to the everlasting bondage of debt, what is it that we have free
institutions of Government?”</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: ” … and if the final vote shall leave
thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless
distress, can we – members of the Government – go to our beds with a
clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the
Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s wonderful language. It would move a
stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: If it would only move old Miser Stevens –
We’ve still got to pay him.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yep – you can’t get around that mortgage. –
I’m sorry, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It’s all right, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Wish I could really do something for you.
But you know Stevens. He’ll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you
don’t pay him tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Let him try it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Goodbye, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well – what are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We can still use my butter money.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Your butter money?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you think I’m grudging it?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not all of it?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – I had to pay the vet in full. He just
wouldn’t have treated the horse this time. After all, we can’t very well
do without a horse.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s all right, Jabez. We’ll find something to
pay Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: If the pig hadn’t broke his leg, we could
have taken him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez! Couldn’t you take a sack of seed
instead?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: To save us work on the spring plowing?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You always said, the field uphill needs a
rest, but if you think –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary, I’m a farmer – always will be. To me
seed isn’t a thing to pay debts with, it’s alive, more alive than
anything – but I guess you’re right. We just got to do it. Oh – how’s it
all going to end?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – you ought to talk to Tom about joining
the Grange.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I will, Mary – always thought a man could be
stronger alone – seems I’ve been wrong about that.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone’s voice</strong>: Jabez! You’ll be late!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: All right, Ma–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: How’d you know to have the calf ready,
Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: I just figgered – knew you didn’t have
enough bills.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – and you figgered right, consarn it!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: That’s a word you’re too free with lately,
Jabez, consarn this and consarn that …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Helps sometimes to say it.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: All right, son – if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Seed alone won’t do, Mary. We have to throw
the calf in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh Jabez! And we were counting on … It’s a
lovely calf.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You’re right, Mary it’s a fine calf. That’s
why Stevens’ll take it for the rest of the payment.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: She hit her head – Carry her in the
house.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Fetch some water – quick!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Keep quiet, Shep.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: What’s ailing that dog?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well … make him keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: And why should I? Let him howl if it makes
him feel good. Consarn it. He’s better off than I am! I wish I could
tell Him… … up there, just what I think.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Hush up such talk, Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I can’t help it. I mean it, I tell you. I’ve
had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me – nothing!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – how do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Let her be, son. She’ll do all right. You
better get yourself straightened out.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, Jabez – don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I’ll get the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, Jabez – all I need is some rest – You go
and pay our debt. Everything’ll be all right then … everything.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s enough to make a man sell his soul to
the devil! And I would, too, for about two cents!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I guess nobody heard. I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Good evening, Neighbor Stone.</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: My name is Scratch – I often go by that
name in New England.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I don’t want to have any business with
you.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Do you deny that you called me? I’ve known
people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn’t expect
it in New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You can’t say that to me! I’m New Hampshire.
If I say I called you, I did. I guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: You’ve had a lot of bad luck these days.
And yet – it’s all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities
–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Opportunities?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Of course. Why man, you have one of the
richest farms in the county. You just go about it the wrong way – so
many men do. Hard work – well, that’s all right for people who don’t
know how to do anything else. It’s all right for people who aren’t lucky
– but once you’re lucky – you don’t work for other people. You make them
work for you.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right.
But–</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: A clever man like yourself – he can find
money anywhere. Money to pay his bills – money for his wife and his
children – money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it
out to him. Like that!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Don’t be afraid of it. Pick it up. Feel it
in your hands.</p>
<p><strong>sharp’s voice</strong>: Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Someone’s calling you, Mr. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>another voice from outside</strong>: Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Howdy, Mr. Stone. We’ve come round to ask
you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What Grange?</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: That farmers’ association – we were
talking about the other day.</p>
<p><strong>eli higgins</strong>: That is, if you had time to mull it
over, proper.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: No, no I don’t want to join! Go away – leave
me alone.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Well – we don’t mean to force you, Jabez
Stone – but – it’s only for your own good.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I’ll look out for myself! … Now go away –
leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Where did it come from?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh, you know the old story – the Hessian
wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold
has been buried under your barn!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes, why shouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Yes, of course, people forgot – or the men
who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It’s mine?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: That’s right, Mr. Stone – there is – – just
one little formality. I’d like your signature here – see. And when it’s
done – it’s done for seven years. It’s our usual form. Of course – we
may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What does it mean here – about my soul?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Well, why should that worry you. A soul – a
soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? – No! – Think of it
– this soul – your soul – a nothing, against seven whole years of good
luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word,
Neighbor Stone, if it weren’t for my firm’s reputation for generous
dealing–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: No, no! Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: A pin, Neighbor Stone! I’m afraid, you’ll
have to prick your finger – but what’s a little pain to a lucky man?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that
will last till doomsday. My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you!
You’re going to be the richest man in New Hampshire!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, I’ll be –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven
years. Oh, I almost forgot – what is the date?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: The seventh day of April –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: 1840. Well, that’ll take us to the seventh
day of April in 1847.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Just to remind you – though of course we’ll
be seeing each other in the interim –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Good evening, Neighbor Stone. A beautiful
sunset, Mr. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary…. Mary … Mary …Mary!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – what would you do with a pot o’
gold?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well – I – I don’t know – I would pay our
debts and well – maybe get a new bonnet, but – really – I think I would
live the same.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – look! Hessian gold. I found it in the
barn.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You found it in the barn, hey?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – I was getting the seed – I stumbled – I
saw one of the boards warped up a bit – and – there it was.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.
Don’t seem right, somehow!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: But it’s true. Take ’em up in your hands,
Mary – feel ’em – they’re real all right. Aren’t you glad?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll try hard – I just can’t take it all
in.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: H’m. Hessian gold. Well – hope it’ll do us
more good than it did the Hessians.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: We’ll none of us have to worry any more, Ma.
We’re rich!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well – that’s comforting! Supper.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It feels fine now, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Will you come into town with me tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hello, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Hello, Jabez – I was just talking to
Stevens about a little extension on your payment.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: And you didn’t get it, hey? Come on, we’ll
have another talk with him.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Stevens!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Well, Stone – have you got the money?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you.
I thought if I made a kind of part payment –</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: No, Stone!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: – in gold.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I’d like to know where you’d get it….</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You know – some folks are just lucky. Others
pick gold right out of the air. Like that!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this
money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the
mortgage, it has become my property.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Doesn’t satisfy, eh? Well – that’s too
bad….</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Rake that one in, too…. And this one – and
this one – and that …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Count it – count it! The Sheriff’s here to
witness.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That makes everything clean now. Come on,
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: What are you doing, Mister Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I wanted to give it all to the church.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a
quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately.
Stop throwing away that money. We mustn’t let people see any softness in
you, Mister Stevens…. People take advantage of softness, you know. Come
out of there – I’ll give you an extension if you’ll forget this stupid
repentance idea.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: That isn’t it. It’s … the loneliness,
Mr. Scratch … the loneliness!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold,
Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I want someone to talk to …</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: You can talk to me …</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: No, no … I want to talk to men … to people
in Cross Corners …to my neighbors …</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I can’t be honest with them.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh, that’s what you want – well, you can be
perfectly honest with Jabez Stone – now.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That certainly was a big day for our store,
Mr. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Here … … and this one is for you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Golly, Mr. Stone, I hope I stumble on a pot
of Hessian gold one day, myself.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What do you think of that, Jabez?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Looks right elegant, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Newest thing by last fall catalogue and
“Godey’s Ladies’ Book.”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You don’t think it looks too fancy?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Did you say too fancy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Lan’s to gracious, child, not for you!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You take it – nothing’s too fancy for us
…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well – maybe it wouldn’t hurt – to have a few
roses.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Right pretty, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll pick out a little shawl for Ma – good and
serviceable.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Take your time, Mary. I’ll be back in half an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where are you going with your trumpet?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Didn’t you hear, Mrs. Stone? Daniel Webster
has promised to stop at Cross Corners today on his way to Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel Webster – here?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Aren’t you going to the reception?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Eddie – must you do that now?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I want to get it right once before
Mr. Webster arrives.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What do you think, Mr. Squire, shall I find
out more about Jabez and his gold?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: You better find out about Mr. Webster – he
is already more than an hour late – can’t understand it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t worry, Mr. Squire, I’ll get it yet.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Friends, neighbors – I beg you to have a
little more patience. So let’s rehearse the parade once more.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Where is the blacksmith ?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: He’s pitching horseshoes with Daniel
Webster.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: With whom?</p>
<p><strong>spectator</strong>: Crazy galoot – thinking he can take on
Dan’l Webster.</p>
<p><strong>another farmer</strong>: Dan’l pitched shoes from his cradle,
didn’t you, Dan’l?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Yes, with my Granny, and she wasn’t bad,
either – Now, I’ll really have to go. The people must be waiting over at
Cross Corners.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: It’s only a short drive, Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Oh – it’s you again. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: With the presidential election coming up, I
thought I could be of some help, sir.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’d rather see you on the side of the
opposition.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: I’ll be there, too!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Say, that’s pretty good, young man.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Pretty good – that’s perfect!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ten throws – Mr. Webster?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Ten throws it is.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You win. Will you ride to the village with
me, Mr. Stone?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I don’t seem to be so very popular after
all – in Cross Corners.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Seems like it’s my fault, Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Not at all, lad – not at all. For a good
game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Black Dan’l’s here!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hey, Dan’l Webster’s here!</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Welcome – Mr. Webster – welcome in Cross
Corners.</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: Your good health, sir.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: What about my friends – let’s all have a
drink and a bumper one for the champion – Mister Stone!</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: Right away, Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Here’s a man who knows what’s good for
Dan’l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land! To the
champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Webster! To the champion of the
whole United States – Dan’l Webster!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: What are you looking for, Colonel? What’s
your name?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa’s the
only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall,
Mr. Webster, but I ain’t seen ’em yet.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well, Martin, I only wear them in
Washington – that’s the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I’ll
show them to you.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Of course. And you tell your father for me
– we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I’m always glad to hear
of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that – the
country’s all right. Do you understand, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes, sir – I guess I do – Gee –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Speech, Mr. Webster – speech –</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Speech, Black Dan’l. Speech!</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: They’re asking for a speech,
Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Speech? – Oh, no – I’m a little tired,
Slossum. And, besides, it’s so pleasant here – in the sun. Your sun and
air are very pleasant in Cross Corners.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: – but – Mr. Webster –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You tell them –</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Speech, Dan’l Webster! Speech!</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: What are we going to do, Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Listen, folks – Folks, I want to say – Folks,
I – I don’t know much about speechifying – – but I feel it my duty –</p>
<p><strong>susannah</strong>: What’s the matter with him? Cat got his
tongue?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hush up, Susannah.</p>
<p><strong>susannah</strong>: Jabez is a smart farmer. But making tall
speeches’s different. Kin he do it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course he can – I mean he never has – but –
Oh, can’t you keep quiet!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, folks – what I want to say is – well,
when a man like Dan’l Webster visits us – we shouldn’t ask him for a
speech – it is for us – to speak, to tell him that we farmers thank our
lucky stars every day in the year for what Dan’l Webster’s done for us.
If anybody’s got corn in his crib and hay in his barn, it’s all due to
our good neighbor, Dan’l Webster, who stood right up in Congress to
protect us from loan sharks by a new law. And after hard work like that,
it’s only natural Dan’l Webster gets tired. He’s tired of making
speeches and just wants a little rest in the sunshine – and, folks, if
he don’t choose Cross Corner’s sunshine to rest in! Now that’s mighty
fine! And I want to say this before I quit talking. We’re hoeing corn in
Franklin County, all due, like I says, to Dan’l Webster, and we’ll keep
on hoeing it till he’s in the White House in Washington – where he
belongs.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone – couldn’t
have done better myself – – under the circumstances. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mr. Webster – I’d like you to meet my wife,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well – I’ll be – if it isn’t little Mary
Sampson from Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You’ve got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang
onto him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: – I’m going to try, Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That’s fine – Well – I’m getting on to
Franklin before night. Good-bye, Mary – Good-bye, Jabez – God bless both
of you – Good-bye, everybody and thank you.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Coming along, Jabez?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We must go on home, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes, Mary. It’s been a long day.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Another drink, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: I want to make a toast – – a toast to
Dan’l Webster – greatest man – in whole United States!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Excellent, Mr. Bibber, excellent – and I’d
like to make another one. To Jabez Stone – who so ably today supported
the – Great Dan’l Webster! – Sometimes people don’t recognize great men
in their own community.</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: Did you hear, Squire Slossum?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Mr. Stone? – a great man? – Well, now – I –
he seems to be a little overbearing – driving in Mr. Webster’s carriage.
No – I am not so sure about him.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Another rum, Squire Slossum.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: – Well – I – I don’t know –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: What? You don’t know? –</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Well, just one more – and this is the last
one.</p>
<p><strong>all of them</strong>: We want Jabez Stone! – for selectman –
Jabez Stone! Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Remember, Mary, how he said it: “Couldn’t
have done better myself, Jabez Stone,” and it was my first speech. I
don’t know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came
flowing like water out of my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Jabez – it was a wonderful day –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But I’m glad to be home again –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Tired?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Worried!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: There is nothing to worry about now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ll never change – will you?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – you just wait and see – It’s all –
just the beginning – just the beginning – of everything. I’ll be the
biggest man in New Hampshire and you’ll be the wife of the biggest
man.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Quiet, Shep – It’s a new moon, Mary –</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: Yes, I know, Jabez – a new moon. And I
saw it over my right shoulder, too. That means good luck – for both of
us.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – we are rich –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s hope and promise in it, Jabez –
Planting and promise of good harvest to come.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – you are right, Mary. I can almost hear
the little blades of grass a-starting up – All the seeds a-stirring
underneath the ground –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t take cold, Jabez. Come – it’s warm in
here.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Jabez – I hated to call you from spring
plowing, but–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why – good morning, Squire.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Morning, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>others</strong>: ’Morning, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: ’Morning, Mrs. Slossum.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Ahem – we want to have a little confidential
talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don’t like to take a man away from his
planting – but sometimes –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Come right into the parlor, won’t you,
folks.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well – Lucy Slossum! Come right in with
us, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Thanks, Mrs. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mighty good of you to come out, Squire –
sparing all this time to – Sheriff, too – and Schoolmaster – mighty
nice.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Ahem – Neighbor Stone, we want–</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Headache – Squire?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Worst I had in years – ahem – starting a
spring cold, I guess – er – don’t happen to have a bit of camomile tea
in the house, do you, Stone?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Camomile tea!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the
Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll get it, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Thanks, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Poor Henry, he’s suffering mighty sharp. Had
an important committee meeting last night, and didn’t get home till
midnight. I was asleep, of course, that late, but this morning – My!
–</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: There’s one thing good for that kind of
headache. Let me show you.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig
Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for
Selectman.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Fine speech you made yesterday, Jabez.
Shows you’ve got the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: New blood – and old stock.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: But – I was just lucky.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Well? Don’t a politician have to be?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: It seems such an obvious candidature to us
all.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Very well, folks. I accept.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Good! That’s the right New Hampshire stuff!
Now – ahem – if we could make a little toast to that effect.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here, Jabez –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary! I’m – Selectman of Cross Corners!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh – Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: To our new Selectman, Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’ll be blowed – nanny-plum laxative
tea!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: And if this doesn’t do it, then you try
this recipe.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slossum</strong>: Thank you – Ma Stone.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Slossum, they are all leaving – you
better hurry up if you don’t want to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. slossum</strong>: Good-bye, Ma Stone. Good-bye, Mary,
and thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: They really finished it, and to the last
drop – my, my.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see
Jabez?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me – Lucy can’t
even keep a secret – Selectman – my son – well, who would have thought
of that?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You could have knocked me down with a feather
– Selectman – me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll never get my washing done.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s one thing I want to talk to you about,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, Mr. Selectman!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: But it’s not very becoming to you to have
your hands in the suds – when the Squire and his wife –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But Jabez – the washing has to be done –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well – that’s the last time – we’ll have
servants to do it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, no. I don’t want to be idle.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: And I don’t want to have a washwoman for a
wife.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well, son, I’m glad to see a Stone come up
in the world again.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now look here, Ma. I’m not a boy anymore. I
want that understood. I don’t aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of
my life. Mary’s got to be the kind of wife a – a big man needs –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – once you said we’d never change –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I wasn’t used to being big – wasn’t used to
thinking in big ways. Now, I’ve made up my mind.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Howdy, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Howdy, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why, of course, Hank – I’ve always got time
for a neighbor. What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Well – here’s how it is …Tom Sharp, Eli
Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about – that new sort
of organization – grange they call it. What you think about it?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I don’t know – don’t seem much of an idea to
me.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don’t
want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Oh – you don’t have to go to Miser Stevens
while I’m around.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Don’t I? … Say, that’s mighty white of you,
Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Not at all, Hank … not at all. Glad to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Thanks, Jabez – I really wouldn’t need very
much … if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for
spring planting …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Seed? … Easiest thing in the world. Come
along, Hank, we’ll pick out everything you need, right now.</p>
<p><strong>hank</strong>: Say … about the interest …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now don’t you worry about that. You just
leave it all to me. We won’t talk business now … just bear this in mind
… I’m not the man to get rich on other people’s hard luck…. No, sir… not
me! …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I been through the mill myself, an’ I know
just how you feel. Here …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Here, that’s the best seed you’ll find
anywhere around New Hampshire.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary …</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: It won’t be the first baby ever born in
this house. There! Made me drop a stitch! Sit down, you make me nervous!
Lan’s, that’s the way a man always is. Thinks his son’s the most
important thing in the world.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: My son! Do you really think, Ma….</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered
to a grandma! But p’raps you got an even chance.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Looks like a storm, all of a sudden. Hope
it won’t wake Mary.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Queer sort of weather we’re having – queer
like everything else.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well, thank the Lord you can always depend
on New England for weather. We’ve got enough for the whole United
States.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I feel – fidgety, Ma – not right at all.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Lan’s, I’d think you was having the baby,
to hear you.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Me – a son.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Money – money’s a funny thing, ain’t it,
Ma?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: I figure that depends a mite on how you
get it and how you spend it, Son.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Do you really think that?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Why, that’s just sense, Son. Now a man
like Daniel Webster – guess they pay him high for what he does. But he’s
worth it – and he helps others. Makes all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I know, Ma, but – Suppose a man got his money
in bad ways –</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Wouldn’t profit him none.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You see, son? I’m old and I’ve lived. When
a man gets his money in bad ways – when he sees the better course and
takes the worse – then the devil is in his heart – and that fixes
him.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ma – and yet, a man could change that,
couldn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: A man can always change things, Son.
That’s what makes him different from barnyard critters.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Where you going, Son?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Good evening, Neighbor Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Look here now–</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn’t cut
that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: But you should, now that you are becoming a
father.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Leave your tongue off of that!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh, certainly. I shan’t even come to the
christening – it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste. But I may
send a friend of mine – just for old sake’s sake. Yes, I might do
that.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone’s voice</strong>: Jabez! Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Your mother! I find her a little difficult
– hardly the type for our sort of thing. Good night, Neighbor Stone.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan’s, I was
worried about you…. Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It don’t matter!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: What’s that you say, Son?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I say – it don’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Now that’s the way to talk, Son! I know
you worked hard for that crop. But we’ll make out.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Make out? We’ll do better than that! I never
thought I’d be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I’d be glad
of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the
Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Ruined – all the fields – ruined.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary – but look – it didn’t touch an ear of
my corn – we’ll have a rich harvest.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: For unto everyone that hath shall be given
– and he shall have abundance.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s right, Ma!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Helloh, Hank – halloh Lem –</p>
<p><strong>lem</strong>: Charge me up for another rum, Cy. Only way I
kin forget my troubles.</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: Sorry, Lem, but I’ll have to count my
pennies, too.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Let him have one more – on me. You’d think
Stone’s standing in good with Providence, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>lem</strong>: My corn’s no more use than a last year’s crow’s
nest.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Maybe you’d let me help you out a bit.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Seems like someone’s giving us the
horse-laugh.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Guess you’re ripe and ready now to join
our Grange, eh, boys?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Now wait a moment, folks … I can make you
some better terms.</p>
<p><strong>cy bibber</strong>: Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Howdy. – Never did see such a hail! Big as
bowling balls out my way. Broke all the winders an’ nearly killed the
cat. I’ll have cider – hard. Boys, I’m here with an offer from Jabez
Stone.</p>
<p><strong>lem</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Well – seeing as how due to yesterday’s
hail, nobody’s got nothing to harvest in his own fields, Jabez says
maybe you could help him harvest his.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Never worked fer anybody else in my whole
life, ‘ceptin’ when I was a shaver, and that was for my old man.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: I wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>lem</strong>: Well – dunno – I’ll think it over.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: What’s there to think about, boys? Here’s a
dollar in advance for every one who will work for Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ma – is she? –</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You’ll be a father any minute now.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Golly, Ma – Consarn that music! Shouldn’t
a-had the harvest festival tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Fiddlesticks! She don’t hear it. Got
better music to listen to than that. There – that’s what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello, Jabez – Here’s your son.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Fetch a bed warmer, Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hey! Look, everybody! Look here! It’s a
boy!</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Hurray for Jabez Stone! More good luck for
Jabez Stone! Hurray! Jabez Stone and his new son!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Lan’s, shut that window, Jabez! Want him
to catch his death of cold?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well – I – I-</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t be cross with him, Ma. This don’t happen
every day.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You go down and see what’s keeping
Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Sure, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Thanks, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Dorothy – what’s keeping you so long? Mary
needs that –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You’re not – Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: No. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: She couldn’t be gone!</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: But she is – I’ve taken her place. Don’t
you remember – you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It – it looks like my hand.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: I have other recommendations, too, from a
very good friend of yours.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Never mind. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: Belle.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Belle –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Belle Dee. I’m from over the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: From over the mountain –</p>
<p><strong>ma stone’s voice</strong>: Jabez! Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: No – that’s for me to do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – ?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: I’ve brought you something to keep you warm,
Mrs. Stone –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: You’re not resting well, are you? I know –
it’s that music. You need your sleep. Is there anything else you
want?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, thank you – what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Belle –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you, Belle –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What a nice – and kind girl – Who is she
–?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: The new girl – Jabez says; she is from
over the mountain.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What mountain?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Let’s dance together – Belle.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: No, Jabez – your place is with your wife
–</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Faster – faster –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Faster – faster –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shh – go to sleep, little Daniel – go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep,
sleep, my baby – Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby,
sleep –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What in sugar hill’s the matter with him?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Nothing, Jabez – just natural for a baby to
cry, sometimes. Shh, little Daniel – sleep – sleep –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Consarn it!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where are you going – ?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez! Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Golly, Belle, that was a good idea – we
should do that every morning.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: We will –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Make him go faster, Jabez – faster – faster
–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hey, you! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jabez’s voice</strong>: You can’t fish there! Private
property! I’m Jabez Stone! I’ll have the Sheriff after you!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It’s wonderful to frighten people like that –
and watch them run.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Mary! Ready? First bell’s a-ringing!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, Ma – I’m ready –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Good morning, Mary. Brought some fish for us.
Want you to cook ’em for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: She’ll do nothing of the kind! She’s going
to church with me, right away!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – for the good of your soul … please
come with us.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I want you to fix these fish!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: And I say she won’t! I’ll not have the
scorn of God on this place – with the smell of fish in it, polluting up
the Sabbath! And as for you – let me tell you, young woman…!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Come along, Ma. Second bell’s a-ringing.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: We’ll cook ’em ourselves. You’ll help me,
Belle.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Of course I will.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Mornin’, Jabez …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hello, Stevens … you’re early today.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Yes, I wanted to get here before the
others…. I want to talk to you alone.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Some other time, Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>squire and others</strong>: Good morning, m’am – Good
morning, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez and belle</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Sit down, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Thanks, m’am.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: I almost forgot –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I hope you’ll have better luck today,
Squire.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: You French?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: No – I’m not anything.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Your game, Squire!</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Sheriff’s coming –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Come in, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Jabez – seems like I’ve been hearing talk
around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in
church, Sabbath morning.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.</p>
<p><strong>voice of minister</strong>: Almighty God, who hast given us
this good land for our heritage; we humbly beseech Thee that we may
always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy
will. Save us from discord and confusion; from pride and arrogancy, and
from every evil way …</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Save Jabez from pride and arrogancy, and from
every evil way.</p>
<p><strong>voice of minister</strong>: In the time of prosperity, fill
our hearts with thankfulness, and in our day of trouble, suffer not our
trust in Thee to fail – amen.</p>
<p><strong>voice of congregation</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Good-bye, Stone – next Sunday, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Granny, when do we move to the new
house?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Move? – We are not going to move – the old
one is good enough for us.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: But I like the new one better.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: That’s just too bad –</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Lan’s to goodness, what happened to that
hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I did not, Grandma.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the
window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: It’s mine, Ma! Pa made it for me – and I’m
not going to give it to anyone!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel give me that beanshooter!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: No! No! I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel! … I’ve stood just about as much as I
can bear!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What happened…. Where are you taking him?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I am going to lock him up.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You’re not supposed to punish my son,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: That’s my business. – Now, it’s all right,
Daniel. What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He lied to me again.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I did not!</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: He never lies to me. Don’t cry, Daniel – I
believe you. You’re always a very good boy and – now come along.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – how can you let her talk like that
when the boy is present? He won’t respect me any more.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Isn’t that your own fault?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My fault? … Oh, Jabez – all I want is to be
proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: He’s my son and I like him the way he is. Why
do you always have to pick on him? If it’s not the boy it’s me. You
don’t like the way I live – you don’t like my friends, or my new house –
or anything.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But Jabez, I never said that!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It shows on your face.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well – I am worried about the way you’ve
changed. That was one thing you said you’d never do – remember?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Oh, for heaven’s sake, leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Come on, Daniel – we’ll go fox hunting in the
upper pasture.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Hurray! I’m going to shoot the old fox dead
with my beanshooter.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Grandma, look at me!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: I see you! Riding pretty high, ain’t you?
Look out you don’t fall off.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Not me!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Fox hunting – a Stone going fox hunting on
a week day – and the earth crying out for the touch of him!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Now, Ma – You just try to set an example for
me, and keep hold of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone – I’m
worried about you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I said you should stop worrying because I’ve
made up my mind!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Webster’s place?</p>
<p><strong>farmhand</strong>: Yes, m’am – musta come many a long mile,
m’am. Horse looks tired – moving like cold molasses.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes – we have come a long way – all the way
from Cross Corners to see Mr. Webster. I hope he’s at home.</p>
<p><strong>farmhand</strong>: Yes, m’am – he’s here.</p>
<p><strong>old farmhand’s voice</strong>: Hey there, Dan’l! Black
Dan’l!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Hullooo!</p>
<p><strong>old farmhand’s voice</strong>: Someone to see you, Dan’l!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: If it’s the British Minister, take him
around to the pantry and give him some Madeira –</p>
<p><strong>old farmhand’s voice</strong>: Just someone from New
Hampshire!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Why, that’s different! Well, boys, I guess
we’ll knock off. I’ve got to see a friend.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well Mary, it’s too bad I didn’t know – I
would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington
– Have another piece of pie –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, really, thank you. – Is Mrs. Webster
coming back soon?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well – she hardly ever comes here – she’s
not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes – I’m all on
my own – sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely – Do you mind if I
indulge?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course not –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: No, you wouldn’t – You’re not the sort of
woman that’s afraid of smoke – or fire – But now let’s talk about your
affairs.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Goodness, Mr. Webster, I’ve done nothing but
talk about that all through dinner.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Yes, you’ve chatted a lot, woman-like
nibbling around the edge – But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer’s legal
mind, I don’t think you ever once came to the point. And there is a
point, isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why – yes – it’s hard to put it into words,
Mr. Webster. There’s this matter of little Daniel’s schooling and the
new house – and well – there’s something else that’s wrong – it gets
worse, year after year – it’s like a shadow growing – I can’t really
talk about it, even to Ma – she puts it all on Jabez and I won’t stand
for that.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’ve heard some odd things about Jabez
lately – he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Webster, you mustn’t believe all that
people say.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You don’t have to defend him to me, Mary –
I’ve been called names myself.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You see, I don’t care if we are rich or poor –
I don’t care if we’re big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was
the first man I loved. He never used to care about money – we were poor
as Job’s turkey, but none of us minded. Now I’ve seen him drive the poor
from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I’ve seen him get hard
and mean, and he isn’t hard or mean. I’ve heard him mock at the church
bells – the bells that rang for our wedding. That’s not like him,
Mr. Webster – It must be my fault somehow – my fault.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Mary – you’ve talked to me as you might
have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a
little. You see, sometimes we think we’re licked in this life – but we
weren’t put here to be licked. Don’t you believe it. Sometimes the
shadows seem to get hold of us – the shadows and the evil – but it is
still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming
over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson
– and other things.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: And now come on, Mary. I want to show you
the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right
here in Marshfield – of course!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Looks all right! – Do you have to tear it all
down again?</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: I’m sorry, sir – that’s part of the
fitting.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, as long as you have it ready for the
party – Look, Belle – that’ll give the folks something to talk about
–</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: The people, Jabez – the people.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: The – folks or people, what’s the difference
among friends?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh – how do you do,
Squire.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?
Well – mighty elegant house you got here.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Hey, you! Watch out there – you’re scuffing
my Brussels carpet – Consarn them.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Jabez! Careful –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Oh – Didn’t mean to talk like that in front
of a lady. Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Well, Jabez – I’m a little pressed for time.
You wanted to discuss something – some business –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Oh yes – yes. Won’t take a minute. Can you
keep a secret?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Why of course –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Dan’l Webster is coming to my party.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Dan’l Webster?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – and that’s the reason I wanted to talk
with you. You got my invitation?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now look – here’s a list of the people I
invited – they’re all the right kind of people – or did I miss
anybody?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: The only one you missed – is the
President.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You think that’s a joke? I had him on there
too, but I was afraid Dan’l Webster might feel insulted.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You keep that – that’s for you. I want you to
talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: You want me to go around –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes siree – that’s the idea. Get them all
here and then say: “Look, folks – here’s Daniel Webster, my guest of
honor.” Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: You mean that’s all you had me come out here
for?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now, Squire, you’re not going to let me down.
We still want to do a lot of business together, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Well – yes –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s fine. Now you can tell people all
about the house, but don’t mention Webster.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: You are not so sure that he’ll come.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Oh yes – I am – want to bet?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Why not – ?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: 5000 – that’s just what I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Shake!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t mind. But my name’s Daniel
Stone.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: All right, Daniel. Jump in.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Gee – that Fair –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It hasn’t opened yet?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: No – but I can hardly wait – Mister – tell
me, will there really be – – a man that eats fire?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Guess there will, if it says so.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: And two unpara– unparalleled Cir-cass-ian
beauties? What is that?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Young man – you got me there.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: ’N Daniel Webster will be there.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: A varied list of attractions. And which
would you like to see first, Dan’l?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I think I’d like to begin with the
fire-eater –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: And what about Daniel Webster?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Well, I thought he’d come in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: And serve him right!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Daniel! Don’t ever let me catch you doing
that again!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Why? It don’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It does hurt! And don’t you do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Make them go faster, Mr…. ?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: No, Daniel – they are not race horses. They
are good old friends of mine. I call ’em Constitution and Bill of
Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I’ve got one called
Missouri Compromise, too, and then there’s a Supreme Court – fine,
dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Golly – I’d like to see all your horses!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I’m a
farmer, you know, and like to show my farm – but the thing I’d like to
show you most, you’ll have to see for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: What’s that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well – it’s high and it’s wide and it goes
a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over
it – it’s the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new
States growing in the West.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Anybody can see that.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You’re wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people
who live and die without e’er seeing it. They can’t see the country for
the money in their pockets – And some think their state’s the country,
or the way they live is the country, and they’re willing to split the
country because of that. Well, I hope you’ll meet all those, when you’re
grown. You’ll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties – that’s
part of the fair, to be sure. But if we’d had to depend on them, in a
permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: But it didn’t stop. I know it didn’t stop.
Granny told me it didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: No, siree, it didn’t. And it won’t – no
matter what happens – just as long as the folks at the fair believe in
freedom and Union. So – Giddyap, Constitution – and let’s keep going,
Mr. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Faster – faster –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I think this is coming to you, young man!
–</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I told you not to do that again.</p>
<p><strong>the crowd</strong>: Black Dan’l! Hurray for Daniel Webster!
The Union and Black Dan’l! Hip, hip, hurray!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well – well – what’s this? I thought I’d
meet you all down there at Jabez Stone’s house- warming. I hope you
didn’t wait for me to lead the parade.</p>
<p><strong>squire</strong>: Not exactly, Mr. Webster. – We wanted to
have a little chat with you before we go to the party. Do you mind
having a drink with us?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Do I mind having a drink with you,
gentlemen? What a question to ask Daniel Webster!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: So you’ve made up your mind to go to the
party.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You aren’t angry with me?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Ah, fiddlesticks – you are old enough to
know what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over
there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I won’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why don’t they come –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know, Jabez.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Play some music – something gay and
jolly.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Think this room is larger than anything
Webster’s got at Marshfield? You’ve been there. What about it, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s – different, Jabez – that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What’s the matter with ’em? Why don’t they
come?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel, you ought to be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: No, no, I don’t want to go to bed. I want to
be here for the party.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What are those people doing there? What do
they want?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: They’re just outsiders. They want to see how
fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They’re waiting for your guests, too
–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Consarn it – I’m paying you for playing – so
keep on playing.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Welcome, Mr. Stevens –</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Good evening, Mrs. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Good evening – I’m sorry, Jabez – I’m a
little late.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: No, you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Where’s everybody?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I dunno – I can’t figure it out. I’ve invited
them all. Why don’t they come?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: They’re all at the inn. I’ve seen them….
Mr. Webster’s there, too….</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Show Mr. Webster that foul contract you
got with Jabez Stone.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: He’s certainly made himself the big frog in
the little puddle around here, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: And it all looked so simple when it started
– like getting loans for nothing. I should have listened to you,
Tom.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well – he’s got you, I’m afraid – got you
sewed up tight in his money pocket. Guess you’ve sold your souls,
gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: I see why you’re here – you knew that nobody
was coming.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Lying to you – Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: You know that you’re in my house.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know – and you could show me the door. You
would, too, if you weren’t still hoping the guests might arrive.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: You think you’re so smart, Mrs. Stone. You
wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but
you’re wrong, you can’t win him back – not that way.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s my problem, Belle.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Now run along, Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is
he now?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Almost seven. No – no, he’s not seven yet I
am sure –</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Well – it seems to me – I remember when you
paid me–</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Oh, never mind – let’s have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: You are afraid!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Afraid … of what?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: – of what happens after we die!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think
happens? We’re buried – that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: But what becomes of our souls?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why do you fret about something that isn’t
there?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: Don’t say that – I know it is –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: All right – so it’s buried with you!</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: What if one hasn’t a soul any more? What of
that?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Huh? – What’s that? Well – what about it? Who
cares, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: I do – and I think you should too.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Stevens – what’s all this leading up to? You
know something. Come on! Out with it – you know something about me!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: They are all friends of mine – from over the
mountain. Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have
a good time.</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Let’s dance, Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>stevens</strong>: No – no – I can’t dance –</p>
<p><strong>belle</strong>: Oh, yes – you can dance with me. I’ll guide
you – You see – it is all so easy – like that – You see – so easy –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh – Mr. Webster – I’m so glad you came!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Are you, Mary? Well, I guess I’m glad
myself – seeing as how you feel this way. Party seems to be quite a
success. Lots of guests, anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well – Mr. Webster! This is a great day for
me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all
my guests!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: That’s just fine, Neighbor Stone – but – I
have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor – where I sit, I mean.
You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez – anybody in
public life has that difficulty – even you, Jabez. They watch us
carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we
think they do – and understand much more. My friends all like to think
that I’ve got the good of mankind always at heart, and I’ve got to make
sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart,
too. Do you know what I’m talking about, Jabez?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: What – what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You, Jabez Stone – you and a lot of poor
farmers, hereabouts – good men of the earth who are in trouble because
of you. Or – am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Contracts? – Yes, they have contracts with me
– lots of ’em – but – but that’s all right. Without me and my money,
they wouldn’t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: They’d have a good neighbor, Jabez – and
that’s worth much more than anything else – much, much more!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’m sorry you can’t see that, I know you
could once – you made a little speech once, that I’ll always remember
and I know the others do too – They remember and they see how you have
changed. That’s why they didn’t want to come tonight to you, Jabez –
you’re as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it’s not
the money, I’ve been talking about, it’s what you make of it.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I – I don’t know what you’re talking about! I
– I haven’t time to listen to all this –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: No – you haven’t time – You haven’t time
for your mother, or your wife, or your child.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: It’s your fault! You brought Daniel Webster
here – just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my
back – made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of
my home – go back to the other house – that old place, where you belong
– I don’t want to – to talk to you again!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Come along, Mary –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel – you come with me.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Belle!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Close the windows and make a fire. Belle!!
Belle!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I
be of any service?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You promised me prosperity, happiness, love,
money, friendship –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised
you money and all that money can buy. I don’t recall any other
obligations. But let’s look at the contract.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Sherwin, Slattery, Stevens, Stone –</p>
<p><strong>soul of stevens</strong>: Neighbor! Neighbor Stone! Help
me!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: That’s Miser Stevens’ voice! – Miser Stevens
–</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: …. Miser Stevens’ soul, Mr. Stone. Yes – I
am sorry for the disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: He ain’t dead – he’s dancing in there.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: He was –</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: In the midst of life – one really hates to
close these long standing accounts. But business is business.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Are they all as – small – as that?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they
vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I’d have
to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing
spread would be astonishing. In your case –</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: My time isn’t up yet.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Trying to break our contract again,
Mr. Stone?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I’m through with you.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: What a headstrong fellow! Well – I guess
you’re quite prepared to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: I have still a year – a year to make up for
everything.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh no, you violated clause five of our
contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Not now! Not now! – Let me make up – let me
make up.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Suddenly you seem quite desperate,
Mr. Stone – – You know I’m a good-natured man. I’m always open to
reason. With a little security – I might–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Anything – anything. – You can have it all
back – that money – the new house – my farm – the whole caboodle!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: I’m afraid that’s hardly the sort of
security I was thinking of – You see – there is that promising little
fellow, your son …</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: No! No! No! Not him – not my son – I’d rather
go with you – right now.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little
upset. It’s not fair to bargain with you now. – I’ll give you until
midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you’ll come with
me indeed.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Daniel! … Daniel! Mary!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary! … Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary … Daniel…</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: My son … what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ma! … Where’s Mary … and little Dan’l?</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Gone with Daniel Webster – to Marshfield,
son…. You told Mary to go–</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mr. Webster … Wait! … Mary!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary! Come back …</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Jabez! … Did you hear, Mr. Webster? – Now
you’ll help him, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’ll fight ten thousand devils to save a
New Hampshire man.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: It’s here you said that you closed the deal
with him?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes, Mr. Webster – it was here where it all
began.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I see. And this is where he’d like to
collect, too.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez …</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Mary – what love and trust could do for
your husband, you’ve done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is
going to be no place for a lady.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Webster – you will help him?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’ll do my best, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You must go now, Mary – you must!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right, Jabez …</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: They make plucky women in New England. H’m
… how long have we to wait?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Not long – now.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Then I’ll just christen the jug, with your
permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting’s wonderfully shorter with
a jug.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: H’m – old Medford.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: There’s nothing like it. I saw an inchworm
take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a
bee. Come – try a nip!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: There’s no joy in it for me.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Oh, come, man, come. Just because you’ve
sold your soul to the devil that needn’t make you a teetotaler.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Mr. Webster, I presume?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I
ask your name?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Scratch will do for the evening. May I –
join you?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Why, certainly – but be careful,
Mr. Scratch – Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even
with old-timers like yourself.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: It even kicked back – once at you, didn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Oh .. not that you ever get drunk! No,
indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep
and enveloping sleep.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: There isn’t enough Medford rum in the whole
of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Talk has never proved that question,
Mr. Webster! Cup for cup – what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Cup for cup!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Are you willing to give me your son in
exchange for an extension of our contract?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Daniel! … You must go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I don’t want to be up there all alone,
Mama…. I want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All right, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: You see who it is. I have to get my pie in
the oven.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Jabez’s new house is a-burning down!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Well, you just let it alone … the consarn
thing oughter burn!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Your spirited efforts on behalf of your
clients do you credit, Mr. Webster – If you have no more arguments to
adduce I’ll take him along now.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your
evidence – if you have it.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: There, Mr. Webster. All open and
above-board and in due and legal form.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: H’m. This appears – I say appears – to be
properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn’t property!
Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced
into the service of a foreign prince.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Well, I never heard the dev– of your
claiming American citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: And who with better right? When the first
wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver
put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still,
in every church in New England? ’Tis true, the North claims me for a
Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell
the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don’t like to boast of it, my name is
older in the country than yours.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand
a trial for my client.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: You mean – a jury trial?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I do! If I can’t win this case with a jury,
you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren’t a match for the
devil, we’d better give this country back to the Indians.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Very well. – You shall have your trial,
Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Let it be the quick or the dead – So it is
an American judge and an American jury!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: The quick or the dead! You have said it.
May – the best man win, Mr. Webster!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I’ll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: You must pardon the leathery toughness of
one or two … Captain Kidd – he killed a man for gold; Simon Girty – the
renegade; he burned men for gold; Governor Dale – he broke men on the
wheel; Asa, the Black Monk – he choked them to death; Floyd Ireson and
Stede Bonnet, the fiendish butchers; Walter Butler – the King of the
Massacre; Big and Little Harp – robbers and murderers; Teach, the
Cutthroat; Morton, the vicious lawyer … and … General Benedict Arnold –
you remember him, no doubt. Dastard, liar, traitor, knave – Americans
all …</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: “Hide not thy face from me in the day when
I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call
answer me speedily. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones
are burned as an hearth. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass;
so that I forget to eat my bread. But thou, O Lord, shalt endure
forever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.”</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Oyes, oyes, oyes! This trial tream of the
Midnight Court of the State of New Hampshire in the County of Franklin,
is now in session. Justice Hawthorne presiding. Oyes, oyes, oyes! The
Devil versus Jabez Stone!</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Who appears for the plaintiff?</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: I, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: And for the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Are you content with the jury,
Mr. Webster?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I object to General Benedict Arnold, Your
Honor, for being a flagrant traitor to the great American cause….</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Objection denied! The prosecution will
proceed.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Your Honor – gentlemen of the jury – this
case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone – the
transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit,
his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested
by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I object.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Objection denied. Mark it Exhibit A.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: I shall now call Jabez Stone to the witness
stand.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Jabez Stone to the witness stand!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Jabez Stone – did you or did you not sign
this document?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes, I did – but you tricked me into signing
it! You told me my soul was nothing … that I could forget all about a
soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: That is highly irrelevant to this case,
Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Leave out the soul. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: I would like to ask Mr. Stone whether or
not I faithfully fulfilled my part of the contract? Didn’t I give you
seven years of good luck and prosperity? Didn’t I make you the richest
man in the country?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Yes – yes, I am the richest man – too rich. I
can’t think of anything but money. That’s the trouble with me.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for
the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your
signature?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: You know darn well it is.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: Does the jury wish to consider the
case?</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: It appears they do not. Take your man,
Mr. Scratch.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I protest, Your Honor! I wish to
cross-examine – to prove –</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: There will be no cross-examination in
this court!</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: Your Honor, you will lose a great
experience if you do not let him speak. There is only one Daniel
Webster.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: You may speak, if you like, but be brief.
And let me warn you, Mr. Webster – if you speak and fail to convince us,
then you, too – – are doomed!</p>
<p><strong>voices of jury</strong>: Drag him down with us – Drag him
down with us.</p>
<p><strong>jabez’s voice</strong>: Save yourself, Mr. Webster – Don’t
speak!</p>
<p><strong>scratch’s voice</strong>: “There isn’t enough Medford rum in
the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.”</p>
<p><strong>voices of jury</strong>: Lost and gone – lost and gone –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Be still!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Gentlemen of the jury – It is my privilege
to be addressing tonight a group of men I’ve long been acquainted with
in song and story, but men I had never hoped to see.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: My worthy opponent, Mr. Scratch, has called
you Americans all, and Mr. Scratch was right – you were Americans all!
Oh, what a heritage you were born to share! Gentlemen of the jury, I
envy you! For you were there at the birth of a mighty Union. It was
given to you to hear those first cries of pain – and to behold the
shining babe that was born of blood and tears. Tonight, you are called
upon to judge a man named Jabez Stone. What is his case? He is accused
of breach of contract – He made a deal to find a short cut in his life –
to get rich quickly…. The same deal all of you once made. You, Benedict
Arnold! … I speak to you first, because you’re better known than all
your other colleagues here. What a different song yours could have been!
A friend of Washington and LaFayette – a soldier – General Arnold, you
fought so gallantly for the American cause, till – What was the date?
Oh, yes – in 1779, a date burned in your heart.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: The lure of gold made you betray that
cause.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You, Simon Girty, now known to all as
Renegade! A loathsome word – you also took that other way. You, Walter
Butler – What would you give to have another chance to let the grasses
grow in Cherry Valley without the stain of blood? – You, Captain Kidd,
and you, Governor Dale – I could go on and name you all, but there’s no
need of that. Why stir the wounds? I know they pain enough. All of you
were fooled like Jabez Stone – fooled and trapped in your desire to
rebel against your fate. Gentlemen of the jury – it’s the eternal right
of man to raise his fist against his fate, but every time he does he
stands at crossroads. You took the wrong turn and so did Jabez Stone.
But he found out in time. He is here tonight to save his soul. Gentlemen
of the jury, I ask that you give Jabez Stone another chance to walk upon
the earth, among – the trees, the growing corn, the smell of grass in
spring – What would you give for one more chance to see those things
that you must all remember and often long to feel again? For you were
all men once. Clean American air was in your lungs – you breathed it
deep, for it was free and blew across an earth you loved. These are
common things I speak of, small things, but they are good things. Yet
without your soul they are nothing. Without your soul they sicken.
Mr. Scratch told you that your soul is nothing and you believed him. It
has cost you your freedom. Freedom is not just a big word – it is the
bread and the morning and the risen sun. It was for freedom we came in
boats and ships to these shores. It has been a long journey, a hard one,
a bitter one. There is sadness in being a man, but it is a proud thing,
too. Out of the suffering and the starvation, the wrong and the right, a
new thing has come, a free man. When the whips of the oppressors are
broken, and their names forgotten and destroyed, free men will be
walking and talking under a free star. Yes, we have planted freedom here
in this earth like wheat. We have said to the sky above us, “A man shall
own his own soul.” Now – here is this man – He is your brother! You are
Americans all, you cannot– – take his side – the side of the oppressor.
Let Jabez Stone keep his soul – this soul which doesn’t belong to him
alone, which belongs to his son – his family – his country. Gentlemen of
the jury – don’t let this country go to the devil! Free Jabez Stone! God
save the United States and the men who have made her free!</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: The jury will consider its verdict.</p>
<p><strong>hawthorne</strong>: The jury finds for the defendant.</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: My congratulations – as between two
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided,
lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you …</p>
<p><strong>scratch</strong>: You’ll never be president – I’ll see to
that!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jabez – Jabez!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: You were worried, Jabez, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I know – that was mighty queer Medford –
knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down
Daniel Webster.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ve done it, Mr. Webster – God bless
you!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ma – Ma – it’s all right, Ma!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: Of course it’s all right, son. You had
Daniel Webster, didn’t ye? Breakfast’s ready! I’ve made a special
surprise for Mr. Webster.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Hurrah for Black Dan’l!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Don’t make so much of a trifle, my
friends!</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Ma says breakfast’s ready, Mr. Webster!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Breakfast … Ah! … Come along friends, Ma
Stone’s a cook this side of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: Jabez – will you join our Grange now?</p>
<p><strong>jabez</strong>: Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you
if you thought I could.</p>
<p><strong>tom sharp</strong>: We’ll be mighty glad to have you with
us.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: There is nothing like a good old country
breakfast. Where’s Ma?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’ll be here in a moment. She has a special
surprise for you.</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Peach pie!</p>
<p><strong>ma stone</strong>: What the D– ?</p>
