<p><strong>walton</strong>: Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the
mast!</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: It’s going to ram us.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: It wouldn’t dare.</p>
<p><strong>supe title</strong>: “The Arctic, 1839.”</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Put your backs into it!</p>
<p><strong>sailor #1</strong>: What’s the use? This godless ice
stretches for miles! Would you have us chow our way back to England?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: No. But we’ll chop our way to the North Pole
if we have to. Inch by bloody inch.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: You can’t mean to go on! Our journey is
ended! The best we can hope for now is to get out of this alive!</p>
<p><strong>sailor #2</strong>: Aye, if the ice ever lets us!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: The ice will break. And when it does, we
proceed north… as planned.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: At the cost of how many more lives?</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: There’s something out there.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You five come with me! The rest stay with
the ship!</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Back to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>old sailor</strong>: Only the ice to starboard, boy.</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: Is it breaking up?</p>
<p><strong>old sailor</strong>: Just dancing on the current. It’ll
freeze even tighter come next wind.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #4</strong>: It was a polar bear. That’s what I
say.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #5</strong>: Say all you want, but you weren’t there.
It left human tracks.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #6</strong>: No man could tear those dogs apart.</p>
<p><strong>sailor #5</strong>: No human. We’ve roused a demon from the
ice.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Something. In the mist.</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: It’s the demon! Shoot while you’ve a
chance!</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Captain, I implore you. The men are
frightened and angry. They want your assurance.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: They knew the risks when they signed on.
I’ve come too far to turn back now.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Then you run the danger of pushing them to
mutiny.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Let them try.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You’re awake. I’ve prepared some broth.
It’ll help restore you.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m… dying.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Are you a physician?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: How is it you come to be here?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: There’s a startling question, coming from
you. I’m captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago,
seeking a passage to the North Pole.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Ah. An explorer.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Would-be. I’m plagued with my share of
difficulties just at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: I can’t say I blame them. We’re trapped in
this ice and bedeviled by some sort of… creature.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Creature? A… human like creature?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You know of it?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Your men are right to be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Then explain it, whatever it is. It could
save the voyage. I’ve spent years planning this. My entire fortune.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’d persist at the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain,
the achievements we leave behind… those live on.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Do you share my madness?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Madness?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition.
Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story
will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: My name is Frankenstein…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Failure has no pride, Victor. You
must try again.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Yes, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Mrs. Moritz, would you and your daughter
excuse us?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along,
Justine. Bring your dolly.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Victor. This is Elizabeth. She’s coming to
live with us.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: She has lost her parents to scarlet fever.
She is an orphan.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You must think of her as your own sister.
You must look after her. And be kind to her.</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: I loved her from the moment that I
first saw her.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by the
storm. Go comfort her.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Don’t cry, Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We’ll build a fort. So the lightning can’t
get us.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you sure it can’t hurt us?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Nothing can. Not ever.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: You must lead, Victor. The lady will
always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and
strong…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Mrs. Moritz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: …aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three,
twirl-two-three…</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Mama, can I dance with Victor?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a
sweeping arc about the room! one- two-three, twirl-two-three.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: …one-two-three, twirl-two-three…
Excellent! You’ll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: Justine. Surely you can maintain better
time than that.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yes, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: She’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: You can do nothing here. Wait
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Mother?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Victor, do as you’re told!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: As a boy, I stood at this window and watched
God destroy our tree.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh God. The blood.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I did everything I could.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: How could all my father’s knowledge and
skill fail to save her?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s not ours to decide. All that live
must die. It’s God’s will.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What kind of God is He to will this?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: She was mother to me as well. But ours is
the job of the living. It’s up to us now to hold this family together.
We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that
alone.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: God took her from us.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He left a beautiful gift in her place. A
baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Our brother.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Poor William! What indignant tears!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: There, there… shhh…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Victor, have a care! You’ll make him
dizzy!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The world is a dizzying place.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, do give him here! He needs to be
comforted and held!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: He needs to vent his outrage to the skies!
Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why
should it be so?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That’s the nature of all progress,
William. Don’t let your brother sway you otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Quite right!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Don’t listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to
be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can
run. Or run before you can waltz!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Give me that child before you fill his
head with drivel!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall
learn to waltz!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Elizabeth, really! He’s quite mad!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Scandalous! What would your dear mother
say?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
two-three…</p>
<p>****: The music here should be our movie’s distinctive</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Auntie Justine, Papa said I could have a
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You can. But not before dinner.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: You dance so beautifully together.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And you look so lovely.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Victor? Spare me one dance?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Go on, ask her. Please. I’m quite out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: My friends, fatherly pride won’t allow this
occasion to pass without my raising a toast.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: To Victor. My son. Who read every medical
book in my library by age thirteen… and then re-read them, which seemed
excessive even to me. Drape yourself in glory, my boy. Study well. When
you return, you return a man of medicine. I will then be honored to call
you “colleague.”</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But never your equal.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No. You’ll surpass me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Smell the air. Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Quite a send-off, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Father’s so proud.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Prouder still. You’ll be the handsomest
student there.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ll have to do better than that.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You will. What do you want, Victor?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: To be the best there ever was. To push our
knowledge beyond our dreams… to eradicate disease and pestilence… to
purge mankind of ignorance and fear…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m not mad.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No. Just very earnest. And very dear.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ve loved you all my life</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: All my life I’ve known.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This feels… incestuous.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is that what makes it so delicious?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Brother and sister still?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I wish to be your husband.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I wish to be your wife.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me
now.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If only I could. But one of us must stay.
Father’s not strong. Willie’s just a child. Who can look after them in
your absence? Who can run the estate?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Only you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I will be here when you return.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My head is spinning. I want to give
myself to you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If we’re to be married, must we wait?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You make me weak.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not as weak as I.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Our decision. Together.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Your decision. For us.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I give you my soul…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …until our wedding night. When our bodies
will join.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Victor. I love you,</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth. My more than sister.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ll make you so proud, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Write to us often.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We never finished our dance. Someday we
shall.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The others will look to you while I’m gone,
Willie. Be strong.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>frau brach</strong>: No real rooms left. All we’ve got is
attic space. No one ever wants the attic space…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This will do nicely.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: In science, the letter of fact is the letter
of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of
yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may
be priests… but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse. Any
questions?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But surely, Professor, you don’t intend we
disregard the more… philosophical works.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Philosophical?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Those which stir the imagination as well as
the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Paracelsus?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa…</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of
Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Those of you unfamiliar with
Mr. Frankenstein’s suggested reading list… thankfully, that would be
most of you… would be well advised to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we
concern ourselves with immutable reality… …not the ravings of lunatics
and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: I am relieved. Are there any relevant
questions? Lecture hall dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was just clearing my throat.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Very well then.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You know, you’re quite mad.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I am not mad.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: As a march hare.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Are you having me on?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Of course I am. It pays to humor the
insane.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Henry Clerval.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Victor, Victor Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I know. You have a way of making an
impression.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Do you really think I’m mad?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you
know, you’ll be teaching toadstools to speak.</p>
<p><strong>schiller</strong>: If it isn’t the sorcerer. Found yourself
an apprentice?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m afraid I rejected his application. He
merely dabbles.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Dilettantes need not apply. What about you?
Schiller, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>schiller</strong>: Von Schiller. I’m interested in real
medicine. Treating the sick.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Really? I myself find sick people rather
revolting. I’m here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard
work that I might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old
ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters.</p>
<p><strong>schiller</strong>: You two disgust me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Rich old ladies and their daughters?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can you think of a better reason?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Quite a few.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do me a favor then… …keep them to
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: It’s turning out to be a good year.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let’s return a tenth of the crop to the
tenants. They had a hard winter.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Not even your father would be that
generous.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Then there’s no need to tell him, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>stableboy</strong>: Miss! The mail arrived! There’s one from
Master Victor!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: …and not a day goes by that I do not
cherish your faces in my mind’s eye or ache to see you all again. Be
assured that I am with you in spirit, and you are never far from my
thoughts. I remain, as always, your loving and devoted Victor. P.S.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It says, give Willie an extra big hug for
me.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Read it again?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That’s no excuse for being a pompous
ass!</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: I’ll see you thrown out of this university!
I’ll go to the dean himself! Take me at my word, Frankenstein! The dean
himself!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The entire school heard it. It wasn’t
something one could miss.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’re a comfort to me, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What now? Writing about it in your journal
won’t help.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s a letter to my father.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Professor Waldman.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Victor, explain yourself.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: You have a way of provoking his. I’ve been
watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: To say the least. I came here to expand my
mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is
cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: You disdain accepted wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No, I embrace it… as something to be used or
discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Now you’ve got him started.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: These are exciting times, Henry. We’re
entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He
wasn’t content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier
of thought</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: …yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been
virtually eliminated. I’ve heard this speech before.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But you haven’t listened, Never in history
has so much seemed possible. We’re on the verge of answers undreamt of…
but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: I understand your frustration. I was young
once myself. Walk me home. Something I’d like to show you.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: You know for thousands of years the Chinese
have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a
chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of
energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in
the earth.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Their doctors treat patients by inserting
needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate
these electric streams.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Preposterous.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My
parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.
I’ve never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It smacks of magic.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Magic. Seems alive, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Electricity.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s utterly fantastic! This is the sort of
thing I’m talking about! We should be learning this!</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Why? God alone knows what it means. Until
it has proven value, it’s nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick.
Hardly fit for the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But the possibilities. Combining ancient
knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental
views!</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: It is a thrilling direction to explore.
Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science
is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed
cautiously. Assess as we go. What I do on my own time is my own
business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind?
Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the
expense of your normal studies.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I doubt that decision is still mine to
make.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology
to Professor Krempe…</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: “…a sincere and heartfelt apology which you
will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and
faculty.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Our profession needs talent like yours.
Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Go home, Victor. Write the letter,</p>
<p><strong>dollying victor in a sww 360</strong>: He stands before the
students and faculty, reading his apology.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …and I further wish to extend my sincerest
regrets to Professor Krempe for my display. My behavior toward him was
both rash and inexcusable.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I knew held get himself in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Must’ve been a terrible row.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He was almost expelled for calling one of
his professors a “pompous… Fellow…”</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He always was opinionated.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He set things right with a proper
apology… and now they’ve put him in charge of dissection lab!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That’s where they cut things open and peer
about inside.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Things? What sort of things?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s far too ghoulish for your young
ears.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The point is, your brother is a brilliant
student well on his way to becoming the finest-and most compassionate
doctor ever…</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Re-configure the leads?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Numbers four and twelve directly into the
nervous system?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …and the medulla oblongata is the transition
between the spinal cord and the two parts I’ve already named… cerebrum
and cerebellum. Any freshmen feeling queasy yet? All of you, from the
look of it. We’ll resume your torture tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: You seem to be adapting well to the approved
curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Despite the lack of challenge.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Victor. He was trying to be gracious.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The strain was evident.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Come now, you must take some satisfaction.
You’ve risen to the top of your class. A position of prominence and
regard.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What keeps me going are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Leave off!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Your Elizabeth must be quite a treasure,
Victor …to justify these prices.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Shouldn’t the nose be above the mouth?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: I’m quite serious. Look at all the charity
and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine
was unheard of.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’re saying all disease will eventually be
eradicated?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: I’m convinced. Not by treating symptoms,
but by diving nature’s most jealously-guarded secrets.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Do you foresee this happening in our
lifetimes?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: No. But someday.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thank goodness. We’d be out of work.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Only you would think of that!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Somebody has to!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget
the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death
itself.</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Oh, now you have gone too far. There’s only
one God, Victor.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And here’s to Him. Everything in moderation,
Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Nothing in moderation, Clerval.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yer not stickin’ it in me! Got pox in it, I
hear tell!</p>
<p><strong>fat woman</strong>: Pox? They givin’ us pox?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: No, it’s not pox, it’s a vaccine…</p>
<p><strong>fat woman</strong>: Vaca-what?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: …vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow
…or vaccinia, meaning cowpox…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I told you there was pox in it!</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: …no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity,
perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is
the point of this whole bloody exercise…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You doctors kill people! I don’ care what you
say, you ain’t stickin’ it in me!</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: I most assuredly am! It prevents disease
and it’s the law! Why am I explaining myself? Somebody restrain this
damn fool!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Professor?</p>
<p><strong>waldman</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They just caught the man who did it.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: He was a frightened soul who acted out of
fear and ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: They’ll hang him all the same.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Good. I’ll be there to hear his worthless
neck snap.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Keep your voice down. You don’t know what
you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn’t have
happened! The bastard deserves to die.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You’re making a scene!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Why Waldman? He of all people should have
cheated death!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You can’t. Death is God’s will!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I resent God’s monopoly.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s blasphemy!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life
trying to help people!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: All the more reason for us to continue his
work with the poor!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No. He had more important work.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: There are sick people who need our help. Here
and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Life and death. Why should You alone have
the final say?</p>
<p><strong>tracking shot</strong>: Things are in the process of being
sorted and boxed. We find Victor poring over Waldman’s notes:</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: To understand the causes of life, we must
first have recourse to death… and examine the process in minutest
detail…</p>
<p><strong>magistrate</strong>: …his body to be left on public display
for a twenty-four hour period, thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked
pauper’s grave. So the court has spoken.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No longer pathetic and useless</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody’s seen
you in months. You haven’t attended a single class.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ve been preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We all know how hard you took Waldman’s
death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time
to concern yourself with life.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That is my concern. I’m involved in
something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman’s memory.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Few months perhaps. I’m gathering the raw
materials even now.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Materials. That’s all they are Tissue to be
re-used.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Nothing. Still nothing.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s been months. It’s not like him.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Something’s wrong. I know it. I’ve heard
rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: So have I</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I should go. I should leave today.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Elizabeth. If it’s true, travel into
Germany would be banned. You’d never get near Ingolstadt. Besides,
they’re only rumors.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And not a word of them to Father. He’s
agitated enough not hearing from Victor.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Read him one of the old letters and
rephrase it. We’ll say it came today. It’ll set his mind at ease.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: With this cholera come to town, we’ll have
plenty more for you.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Not optimal. Must use. No time to replace.
Body can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: I stitched it together with my own
hands…</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: A patchwork man of my own
devising.</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: It took nutrients like a child
receiving milk… blushed like a young girl with the blood I forced
through its veins…</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: …all in preparation.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: God’s sake, what is that stench?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This is a bad time, Henry. I’m busy just
now. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Things have gone worse with this cholera
outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended.
University’s shut down.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes? And?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Listen to what I’m saying. The militia’s
arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we
still can.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’ll be leaving then. Just as well. You
never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Schiller? You’re leaving? Where’s all that
high talk about treating the sick?</p>
<p><strong>schiller</strong>: To hell with them. And you.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Time running out. Rate of decay
accelerating. Must strike now… or start again from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Live, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s alive. It’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Massive birth defects. Result is
malfunctional and vile. Have chosen to abort.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Bring out your deeeaaad! Bring out your
deeeaaad!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Here! What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>rough man</strong>: Stupid bastard!</p>
<p><strong>worker #1</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>worker #2</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Victor!</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Don’t dawdle, lad! The sick cart! Lift on
three! One, two, three!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No… no… I’m not dead… please… Don’t put me
on the cart! I’m not dead! I’m not dead! I’M NOT DEAD!</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Yes, yes, I’m coming…</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Bring Grandfather to the table.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just
a sip. I’ve been worried we might lose you. It’s been touch-and-go for a
week.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: A… week?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We feared cholera. Turned out to be
pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running
around in a storm.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Is that your diagnosis?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Mine and Professor Krempe’s. We’ve been
trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we’re out
working with the cholera victims. It’s his turn for that just now.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You’ve been going round-the-clock?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: We catch a few hours sleep where we can.
Usually here at your bedside.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Everything in moderation, Clerval.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who
can’t fend for themselves. They’ll be dead by the thousands before this
is done. They don’t stand a chance out there.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No. They don’t.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Victor. This place looked like a charnel
house. What went on here?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’ll be months before you’re well enough.
Meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I found these. Some of the postmarks go back
nine months. Why don’t you open them? And when you’ve the strength, have
the decency to ease their minds with a reply. Soon as the city ends
quarantine, I’ll even mail it for you. Along with this. It’s a beautiful
gift. Does her no good lying here.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It can’t survive.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Not much to look at. Even less to eat. I
don’t how we’re going to get through the winter with this yield.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We’ll sell another pig at market.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: One less for us.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We’ll make do. We always have.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: I’ll see if I can scratch a few more out of
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I wish we could thank our
benefactor.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Nothing in this life comes free of cost. I’d
like to know who and why.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s the Good Spirit of the forest.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Who’s been filling your head?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It does no harm.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Of course it is. Now finish your food before
it gets cold.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Who’s there? Felix? Children?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Good! And now the next</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …freh…nnn..nd. Freehhnnnd.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Your hands are bleeding again. Come in. I’ll
rub liniment.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: .brread… motherrr… frriend… Treeeeee.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: What is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: “…but it’s been so long since I’ve heard
from you. Remember the vow we took the night you left? You must be
honest with me if your feelings have changed. Answer for the sake of our
friendship, and both our future happiness.” She wrote that four months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A woman like that is far too rare to be taken
lightly.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Ch…uur-ch. Church.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Ch…uuu…ch.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Good. And the next.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Fl…oww.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Floww…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …wwer. Flower.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: …wer. Flower?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Very good! Maggie. Try the next.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Garrr…denn. Garden.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Maria! Look! It’s snowing!</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Maggie! Thomas! You’ll catch your death!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Let them play. There’s plenty of wood
for the fire.</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: He’s right about that.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: It’s snnowwinng.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That one! It’s the most beautiful tree I’ve
ever seen!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Most beautiful… tree…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: For the… Goood Spirr-rit… of the…
Forr-rest.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: …with particles of heavenly fire, the God of
Nature did his soul inspire… and pliant still the ethereal energy which
wise Prometheus tempered into paste…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Myyy Darrllnng Vic…tor… Willee haaad hisss
burrth-dayyy. I wissh… yooo cuud huvv beeen… herre… to sharre ut… withh…
ussss…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I know you’re there. Won’t you speak to
me?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …of sscience… and to c-create… a beinng…
in the image of man… assembled ffrrom… the… dead bodieess I have…
gatherrred…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: God in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Would you like to sit by the fire?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: The music? Or the fire?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I’m glad you finally came to the door.
A man shouldn’t have to scurry in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Better that way… for me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I’m… very, very ugly. People are afraid.
Except you.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It can’t be as bad as that.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Worse.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I can see you with my hands. If you’ll
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: You’re an outcast.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Yes. I have been seeking my friends.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Friends? Do they live around here?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Yes. Very close</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Why do you not go to them?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I have been… afraid. Afraid… they will
hate me… because I am so very ugly… and they are so very beautiful</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: People can be kinder than you
think.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I am afraid.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Perhaps I can help. Tell me who.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I love them… so very much. I want… I want…
them to be my ff-family. I II-Ilove them ss-so very mm-mm- mmuch…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Don’t let them hate me!</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Leave him alone!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: It’s me! It’s mmmmeeeeee!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …no.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Geneva.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Our carriage is here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. krempe</strong>: Such a terrible winter. I’ll praise God
to see those gates open again.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: I’ll have all your things sent on. They
should arrive soon after. It’s been a rough time, lad. For us all. But
if you’d like to come back and finish out your final term once
university re-opens…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Thank you, Professor. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>krempe</strong>: Write and let us know you’ve arrived
safely.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Take me home, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Elizabeth! Justine!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What’s all the fuss? Why are you
shouting?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: He’s coming home! Tonight!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Who? Victor?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s what I’m telling you!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s Victor!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: It’s beautiful! May I? He looks so
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let this locket be a token of the vow we
took the night I left. He’s coming home to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Married! The two of you?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you were
children!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: That’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Elizabeth? Can I take this to show
Peter?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Willie, it’s not a toy for your
friends.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ll take extra special care, I promise!
Pete’s never seen what Victor looks like! He’ll admire it
enormously!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Don’t dawdle. It’ll be dark in a few
hours.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Join us for champagne! My son is coming
home!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Wait! Don’t be afraid!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: Justine! Pay attention!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I’ll be all right. Really.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Have you seen Willie?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is he not back yet?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Claude rode over there to see if held lost
track of time. They say he never arrived.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s far too late for him to still be
out.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Don’t worry, Monsieur, we’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: There! Look!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Quite a place.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Thank you, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This. My home. My family. If not for you,
I’d be dead in a burial pit somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moritz</strong>: Sir. I’m terrified for my girl.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We’ll organize another search now that it’s
light enough. We’ll find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What is Father’s outlook?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet and
proper care he may eventually regain some or most of his strength.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>policeman #1</strong>: Mr. Frankenstein. We’ve apprehended
the murderer. Not five miles from here, hiding in a barn.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>policeman #2</strong>: It’s very unsettling, sir. And quite
strange. Perhaps you’d better come with us.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Victor?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Victor! It’s you! Thank God!</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Is it true? What they say about Willie? Is
it true?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Willie. My poor little angel. Victor! They
think I did it!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I don’t believe… I am in need of your
comfort… anymore.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Did you, Justine?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>kitchen maid</strong>: I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor
thing, I said, what’s all this? And she spilled her heart to me about
Master Victor. How she’d always loved him, and now he was coming home to
marry mistress Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>kitchen maid</strong>: She cried and cried about the
beautiful locket he’d sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me
never to tell a soul. That was before the boy went missing,
a’course.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I always viewed her with brotherly
affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Rejection can be a powerful wound.
People have been known to do uncanny things.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: But to commit so ghastly and terrible a
crime against a child she loved?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Justine and I grew up as sisters. I know
her better than anybody.</p>
<p><strong>defending counsel</strong>: Do you think it possible she
committed this crime?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: William was as much her child as mine. We
were both mother to him. I believe she would sooner have strangled the
life from her own body.</p>
<p><strong>defending counsel</strong>: Then you consider the charge
without merit.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I consider the charge imbecilic.</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn’t
you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could
search no longer.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you
love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? Answer the
question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I have always loved him.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Is it also not true that you murdered
his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our
child. Victor’s and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: So you have claimed. Yet you have no
explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of the poor
murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the
murder. The locket you so coveted. How did it come to be in your
possession?</p>
<p><strong>justine</strong>: I have no knowledge of that.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: My mind was not playing tricks. He was there
in the storm… gloating over his crimes… challenging me to come.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But why risk yourself? Hasn’t this family
suffered enough?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ve no choice</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If what you say is true, it is a matter
for the police!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: They’ve done a fine job. Hanging an innocent
for the crime of a fiend.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do you know this man? Is there something
between you?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I know only that he is a killer. And I shall
bring back his carcass.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Come warm yourself if you like.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You speak.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Yes, I speak. And read. And think… and
know the ways of Man. I’ve been waiting for you. Two months now.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: The letters in your journal. That and a
geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Kill me and have done with it.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Kill you? Hardly that.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Then why am I here? What did you want with
me?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: More to the point, why am I here? What did
you want with me? What does one say to one’s Maker, having finally met
him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from
my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote
me?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Fine words from a child killer. You who
murdered my brother.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Your crime… as well as mine.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: How dare you. You’re disgusting and
evil.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Evil? Do you believe in evil?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I see it before me.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I’m not sure I believe. But then I had no
one to instruct me. I had no mother… and my father abandoned me at
birth.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Were the dying cries of your brother music
in my ears?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I took him by the throat with one hand…
lifted him off the ground. And slowly crushed his neck. That poor,
innocent child died in my grip… because all I could see was your face…
and all I could feel was my rage. And when I let him go, he fluttered to
the grass like a sparrow…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Later, when they were searching, I
followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: She was so lovely. I longed to touch her…
and seek her sympathy…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …but I simply returned the object which
had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: You gave me these emotions, but you didn’t
tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead. Because of us.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Why, Victor? Why? What were you
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: There was something at work in my soul which
I do not understand.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was
that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised?
Good people? Bad people?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Materials. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: You’re wrong. Do you know I knew how to
play this?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: In which part of me did this knowledge
reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and
speaking. Not things learned… so much as things remembered.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They
taunt me in my dreams. I’ve seen a beautiful woman lying back and
beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I’ve seen boys
playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were
these? Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Then perhaps I believe in evil after
all.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: There is something I want. A friend.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Friend?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: A companion. A female. Like me, so she
won’t hate me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Like you? Oh, God, you don’t know what
you’re asking.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I do know that for the sympathy of one
living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes
of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would
not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the
other. That choice is yours. You’re the one who set this in motion,
Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: And if I consent?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: We’d travel north, my bride and I. To the
furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we
would live out our lives. Together. No human eye would ever see us
again. This I vow.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Soon?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes. I want this over and done with.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I’ll be waiting. And watching.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I thought I’d never see you again!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’m all right. I’m safe,</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What happened up there?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I didn’t find what I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: These have been fired.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: At shadows. My nerves got the better of
me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What sort of task?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It’s not something I can explain now.
Perhaps someday.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What of our marriage? Victor, we’ve had
so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We need each other now, I need your
comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: A month at most, that’s all I ask.
Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to
see that they do. For our family’s sake. For our sake. You are life
itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You must regain your strength to preside at
our wedding… and spoil your grandchildren later on. These are duties you
cannot shirk.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We’re all safe now. I promise</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: God forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I prayed never to see these again…</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Whatever they are.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I won’t bother asking what or why. You
wouldn’t tell me anyway. I just hope you know what you’re doing…
…because if this is a repeat of Ingolstadt, I won’t be around to pick up
the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I want her.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Why… her?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Her body pleases me.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your
words.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: My words.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging.
We’ll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities
are too decayed. They’ll have to be replaced. The fresher the
better.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Want some yourself? Or just like to
watch? What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I know you can.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: A brain. Extremities.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This was not taken from a grave.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: What does it matter? She’ll live again.
You’ll make her.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No. I draw the line.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: You will honor your promise to me!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I will not! Kill me now!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: That is mild compared to what will come.
If you deny me my wedding night. I’ll be with you on yours.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me
today.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why the change? What about your work?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: It was misguided and pointless. Is your
answer yes?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It is</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: We’ll leave this afternoon, right after the
ceremony. Pack only what you need.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Does this have something to do with that
man you saw?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes. We’re in danger here. Every moment we
stay.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Victor, tell me why! Trust me!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I do. But you must trust me for now.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: This is not… the grand wedding… I had hoped
to give you…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: We gather now in the sight of God to witness
this man and woman bond their lives in matrimonial vow.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Be especially on your guard. Stay cautious
to a fault.</p>
<p><strong>stable hand</strong>: Who is this man, sir? How shall we know
him?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: He is huge and deformed… and quite
insane.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: He killed Master William and sent Justine
Moritz to the noose! No hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard on
sight!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Are you sure you’ll be all right?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Yes, don’t worry. I’ll look after your
father. You look after her.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I’ll be back as soon as I’ve got her far
away and safe. We’ll hunt this fiend down together.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Only if you’ll tell me who he is.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I owe you that. Done.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Victor?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You’re the Devil himself.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Yes, and I’ve come to snatch your soul…
…unless you tell me where they’ve gone.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: That was the last ferry. There’s nothing
else till morning.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Damn it</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: We’ll ride on ahead and secure you lodging
for the night.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Make sure you keep your pistols dry</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: They’re dry enough. And if they fail,
we’ve others. And if those fail… …we can always gut the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Don’t worry, sir. You’re well guarded. Now
why don’t you go upstairs to your wife? It’s not often a man has his
wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re soaking.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Brother and sister no more.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Now husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: I remember the first time I ever saw you.
Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side.
So beautiful even then.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I have been waiting for this ever
since.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Victor!</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Open this door for no-one!</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: I saw him in a flash of lightning! He
vanished toward the lake!</p>
<p><strong>claude</strong>: Get after him!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Don’t bother to scream.</p>
<p><strong>guard #3</strong>: We lost him.</p>
<p><strong>guard #4</strong>: Why are those open?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You don’t want to hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: You’re more lovely than I could ever have
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I keep my promises.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Oh God… he took her heart… he took her heart
from me…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Live.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you remember.
Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You must. You must.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Say my name. Say you remember.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes. I’ll help you remember.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: …one-two-three, twirl-two-three.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: She’s not for you.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I’m sure the lady knows her own mind.
Doesn’t she? Let her decide the proper suitor.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Elizabeth, no! Say my name.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Vic… tor?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: …no…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You killed her! You killed her!</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: We killed her.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Victor.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: All that I once loved lies in a shallow
grave. By my hand.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: You should have been my father’s son. He
would have been so proud.</p>
<p><strong>arctic victor</strong>: I followed his trail north… always
north… and always one step behind… never stopping… driven by my fires of
rage… and revenge…</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: A year now I’ve followed him. Perhaps more.
Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find…
whatever it was… I was looking for… and neither will you, my friend.
Value life above ambition… or those glittering prizes you seek will
crumble to dust in your fingers… as they have in mine. See your loved
ones again. I cannot.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Rest now.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: A warming wind.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: This ice will break yet. How’s our
guest?</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad,
poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Aye, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: He never gave me a name.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: You were with him at the end.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I was watching.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I longed to be with him. But I wanted his
final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: What is that to you? Evil as you are.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I am as he made me. In his own image.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: You drove him to his torment.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: And he drove me to mine.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Then why weep for him?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Would you not? He was father. And mother.
We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Could we ever have forgiven?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: I’ve never been shown a kindness. Show me
one now.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: What kindness?</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky
with his passing.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: It has a right to bear witness.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Stand fast. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Swim.</p>
<p><strong>grigori</strong>: Don’t do it…</p>
<p><strong>creature</strong>: For God’s sake… I will.</p>
<p><strong>walton</strong>: Home</p>
