<p><strong>doctor o.s.</strong>: Push… That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Okay… Mrs. Dunne you’re doing great. There’s
the head… I can see it now… Congratulations, uhh, it’s… gone back
in.</p>
<p><strong>doctor v.o.</strong>: You’re going to need to push
harder.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne v.o.</strong>: It feels like he’s holding on.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You got a shy one here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: I think it’s holding onto my lungsungs-
ungs- ungs.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s a boy! Ow, he bit me. A little
help.</p>
<p><strong>ten-year old harry</strong>: Captain Rob fell in the well!
Help him! Captain Rob, can you hear me!?</p>
<p><strong>officer dave</strong>: Now Harry we can’t keep coming out
here getting your… friend out of trouble. You see it’s keeping us from
chasing the real bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>ten-year old harry</strong>: Thanks for saving Captain Rob.
Okay - wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: I’m sorry David, He just gets a little
mixed up sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>officer dave</strong>: Oh that’s okay. Harry’s a fine boy,
overly active imagination is all.</p>
<p><strong>ten-year old harry o.s.</strong>: Lay off the breaks, Captain
Rob.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Yes, Harry. I can’t home school you
anymore. So maybe it’s time to make some new friends, some friends your
own age…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m just not ready.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Oh, I almost forgot. Captain Rob left
this behind for you, he said count your steps very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow, a treasure map! What’s the treasure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: It could be anything. You’re going to
discover a whole new world when you get to school.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow just like Marco Polo.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know Mom, like in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: You’re going to be just fine, HARRY.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know I am, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Here’s your lunch. And an apple and
banana for extra energy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe the treasure’s a chest full of apples
and bananas!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Could be. Sweet boy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mom, you know that never works.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk
it? You’re a good kid, Lloyd. I don’t say it enough, but I’m proud of
you son.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Thanks, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Here’s for not crying.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Keys, please.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You sure are looking sharp there in your back
to school outfit.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No can do. Gotta catch my bus. See ya,
Pop!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But you’re already at school! We go through
this every year.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Out of my way! Can’t miss my bus! Gotta get
to school!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Seven hundred thirty two… bite number six…
Follow the map, find a friend - how does the apple work into this. This
is distracting. One of these has to go.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Must catch bus…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Somebody chipped my tooth.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How do you think I feel? Someone bit me in
the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You could’ve saved that for the tooth
fairy!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s stupid! I happen to know my mom is the
tooth fairy.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so
cool!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, she must do all the flying around when
I’m asleep. HARRY Dunne.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does
that name not sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Probably because we’ve never met.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No, that’s not it. Anyway - LLOYD
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy,
and I’m talking to Santa’s kid!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I haven’t seen you around here before.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Home school. Til today.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Home school? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I go to school where I live.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Me too!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think it’s just over there.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, it’s a treasure map.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My mom says the treasure’s somewhere in the
school.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I don’t know. I’m pretty familiar with the
school and I’ve never seen that “X”. But… I do know something.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m “it”? What’s “it”?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I don’t really know. But whatever it is, it’s
something you don’t want to be. And, right now, you are.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: High school is all about looking cool. So
stick with me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow. Are those cheerleaders, just like on
TV?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yeah, dangerous cult. Don’t make eye contact
or they might talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t we want them to talk to us?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No no no no no.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Well, besides cooties and other medical
reasons, they’re not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be.
Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: She’s a total dork. Just look how she
dresses.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh my gosh, I don’t think she’s even wearing
underwear!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How nerdy is that? I’m wearing two pairs
right now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me too!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: This is my Injun friend, Turk. He’s part of
the cool crowd. Hey Kimosabe!</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Shut up, ass face.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s the Iroquois name he’s given me
because I have the strong face of an ass.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well I hope the carpet matches the
drapes.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In the new library there.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh, yeah. I don’t think they do. You’re new
here, right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Depends how you define ‘new’…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You’re the kid who was home schooled.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’ve been assigned to write an article
about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the
new four-color ink pens at the student store.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Four colors? Neato!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah, well, I’d much rather write an expose
or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens
around here. But, I chose you and that’s fine. I’m Jessica Matthews.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: HARRY Dunne.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Hey, freak show, did Jessica give you that
banana in your pants?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Naw, my Mom did.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Gross!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wanna bite?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: TURK, leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: TURK, leave him alone. You’re coming too.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You’re
in!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: So have you been held back two years like
Lloyd?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. I’ve been held back three.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: … and, Principal Collins, you’ll be
pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are “South of the Border”
days. We’ll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese
quesadilla.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Good. Good. Good. Well, that’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: God, I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: And I you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins v.o</strong>: Yes. Yes. Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: PRINCIPAL COLLINS? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins o.s.</strong>: Yes, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Uhh, Sir it’s time for morning
announcements.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Yes, I know dear. Well, why don’t
you do the announcements this morning.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: But what do I announce?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: You announce the most important
news of the day.</p>
<p><strong>talia</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Make something up.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: You know honey, I’ve finally
figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that
condo in Waikiki.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: How baby-cakes? You’ve done it all.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Small potatoes. This one is big
time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: It’s the big potato.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Yes, it’s the big potato. Just
have a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Like you.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Anyway, the state is giving a
hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special
Needs class.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to
do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: No. No. That’s not it. We don’t
kill him. We don’t kill anybody. But I like the way you’re thinking.
You’re focused and you’re trying to follow. No, what we need to do is
start a fake Special Needs class.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: We start our own class?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Maybe someday. Aloha cold
weather, aloha hot weather.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: You said “aloha” twice.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Aloha means hello and
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Oh wow. Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Now, the problem is where do we
find kids we can pass off as “special”?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Times two.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I think you’ll make a good
teacher.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You know Harry, this is my favorite time of
day.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, it’s nice. And your friend TURK is
totally great.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yeah, he’s aces. Thanks, Turk!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: God, she’s beautiful. My wiener’s all
tingly.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Shift to your left.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Welcome to Special Needs orientation.
I’m Ms. Heller, the lunch lady, er, I mean your new teacher.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who’s Principal Collins?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: The principal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Your assignment is to pick the class.
Find some other students just as special as you.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Will that be on the midterm?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You know, you’re the first person I’ve
brought here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, is this your special place?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No, I just usually eat my lunch on the
crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can we eat there tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sure, but first we have to find kids special,
needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’ll be like taking candy from a
stranger.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: H A R R Y…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The second R is silent.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh, of course.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: His curse is our blessing.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to
you?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Skateboard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: One day they’ll find a cure.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You brave soldier.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What? It’s nothing, the cast comes off in six
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Of course it does. Obviously in denial. Maybe
we can help.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re part of a special class taught by the
lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you’d like to join us, it
doesn’t require any walking.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And nobody will make fun of your horrible
deformity.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How much homework is there?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s the downside. There is none.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a
class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You can bring whatever you want, little
friend.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Okay. I owe you this one.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …oh also, we even have a slogan. ‘S’ and ‘P’
stands for ‘Special People’, which is the kind of kids we are. ‘A’ and
‘Z’ is for ‘Aren’t Zeros’ because that is less then one, and when you
put it all together it spells…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, what are you doing? She’s a foreign
exchange student. She doesn’t speak the English. CHING CHONG ching
chingy chingy chong chong.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: How about Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Which one’s Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: The horse.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A horse? I don’t think so, pal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow! It’s a half-boy, half-horse. The boys
walk up to him, impressed.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Now that’s more of what we’re looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Well I need to get a job and you’re telling
me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You were born free and free you should
remain.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Whoa, Nellie!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd v.o.</strong>: Special Needs class 1986.</p>
<p><strong>harry v.o.</strong>: We are the chosen ones.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Maybe we should ask Jessica to join the
class.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: JESSICA? Please hold for my reaction.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right, I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where’s
Mr. D?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: He passed away three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Well he missed a great pot of stew!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: It was meatloaf. You just put everything
in your soup.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I liked it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Oh, Harry, I’m so proud of you making a
real friend.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is it okay if he spends the night?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: LLOYD, did you ask your parents?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yeah, I left my dad a note.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Huh! Who woulda’ thought the combination of
these condiments would leave such a shine…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay
boys, eat up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom’s pie!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: So boys, how was your first day?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Got any crazy eights?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go fish.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: War!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Ha! Now move your peg seven spaces and put
your shirt on backwards. Boy, you really suck at this game.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain
Rob.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Who’s Captain Rob?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just a guy I hang out with.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I know the type. Lives in the basement,
smells like a sponge…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an
eye patch, got a hook for a hand…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sounds like a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? No no. He’s got a parrot on his
shoulder, buries treasure…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yeah, he’s a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t think so. This guy drinks rum from a
barrel, says “yo ho ho” has a peg leg…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Peg leg?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, go-cart accident.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Exactly! A pirate!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If he heard you talking like that he’d make
you walk the plank. Three, two, one. Now it’s your turn, spin.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow
it!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mmm, that’s good top hat.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Hey you two. Lights out.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey can be on top?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Only If I can be on the bottom</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: `Night, Mrs. D.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Thank you, for being a friend to my
HARRY.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Whoa. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Your mom made a move on me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She did not.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Who knows? Maybe someday I’ll be your new
daddy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD, she’s my mom.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I can’t help my heart. And when I’m your dad,
you’ll have to do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will not.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Don’t use that tone with me, young man.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I will stop this car right now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re not my real dad.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You take that back!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut Up! Buttlick!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Where did you learn that word?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I learned it from listening to you! I hate
you!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Kids.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. No
class today. Take a lunch, a long lunch.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Everyone thank Principal Collins for
creating our very own Special Needs class.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Thank you Principal Collins blah blah for the
new blah blah blah…</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: They’re perfect. You are pioneers
of Providence Hill High. The first special needs class.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: To take a picture for Superintendent
Zimmer?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: My god, what stinks?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That would be me, sir. The wife made stew
last night.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up Lloyd. You’re not married yet.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Well I hope you enjoy your new
classroom. This isn’t it. You’ll be going to a new wing behind the
school built especially for you.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Cool! A new wing!</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Okay, kids, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What about the crippled boy?</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Dude, I can walk.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You brave, beautiful, naive bastard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Collins is a great man!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Now you see why he was elected principal?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: So far so good. We’ll need more
pictures. Why don’t you take them on a field trip tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: And, take some more pictures.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Wow, you are smart.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: And you are great in bed.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller o.s.</strong>: I put in for a sub.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hello, students.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: … I’m Mr. Christmas and I’ve been assigned as
your substitute teacher for today. I think you’ll find me tough but
fair. And, I imagine I’ll learn as much.. from you.. as you will from..
me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: HARRY.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You look familiar. Did I have your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Okay. Anyone else have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s with horse-boy, now he’s a bright
shiny sun?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Don’t look directly at him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: LLOYD, may I see you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Class, please study on your own. There seems
to be a family emergency because there’s no other reason why my father
would interrupt me WHILE I’M WORKING!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s your dad?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You must be in the Air Force.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m a custodian.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well then…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you crazy kids doing in my tool
shed?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: We’re not crazy. We’re “special”. PRINCIPAL
COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: My boy’s special, well how about that. I knew
you were different.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: So I guess you’ll need a new spot for your
moonshine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I reckon so.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Can someone tell me why we’re in a tool
shed?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Who cares Lewis? It’s better than real school.
If we don’t mess this up, we can go the whole year without doing any
real work at all.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: We can do anything we want.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: So if I had a girlfriend like TERRI, I could
like, bring her here, and do stuff?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You got it, jerk-off.</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: But I came here to learn about
America.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Baby listen, there’s nothing more American
than not doing anything and getting away with it.</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: Then I’m in. Just like Jerk-Off.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wha-wha-what am I doing here? I’m supposed to
be in A.P. Biology.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: Come on kid! It’s fourth and goal! Ten seconds
left on the clock!</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: We need you now! Get it together!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Let’s get ’em!</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: He’s in.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: If he comes back.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …and who was Benjamin Franklin again?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill
Godzilla.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Welcome to public school, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, teach, how’d you get so smart?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: When you live in the basement of the school,
you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on
your brain. Now how about a slushee?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A. Slushee. Don’t tell me. Abraham Slushee.
Third president of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And he invented fire.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And this is the frozen delicious treat he was
named after.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nice jugs.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: They can’t be real.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, no. You’re not gettin’ me again.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey. Fella. Victoria’s Secret huh? Ya know
those clothes are for chicks.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Two fifty.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: That’s two fifty.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Please pay me two fifty.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: No, I’m not it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, you are. He touched you. You’re “it”
until you touch someone else.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: I have five kids at home, I know how it works.
I’m just not “it”. Okay guys? Two fifty.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Enough!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can he do that?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, he can and he did. And now it’s on
like Donkey Kong.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: These are really cold, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s why you have to drink it fast, trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Owww… refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Ow… What do you want to do, HARRY?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know. Owwww.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Maybe I should go home and grade papers.
Owwww.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My head is suddenly killing me. Maybe it’s
from all the learning today.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Put some ice on it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Owww.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And my mouph is frozen.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hey guys.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Heddo Jeth-ica.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind
of special class.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: If dou’re trying to get in, dou’re doo
late.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh no, I know that class isn’t for me. But
I’m happy for you guys.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me,
Jethica?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes, you and the whole Special Needs
class.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Why ith dat newth?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: This school’s never had one before. I’d
like to talk to you and all your special friends.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald
twrip.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: A field trip? Maybe I’ll join you. See you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There she goes, now wearing nothing but her
underwear.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: What a nerd. I don’t know where that girl’s
ever gonna find a husband.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Knock knock.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Guess what”s under these coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Well I’ve got a little surprise
for you.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: You got the Extender?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: No. No. I heard from
Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he’s so impressed with
our Special Needs class, he’s bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the
Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Monkey, this is too exciting! I can’t
believe our dream is coming true.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Smile sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: So what do you keep in there?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape
everything that goes on in this office.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Everything. Just for the
record.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Oh, just like the President.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Just like the President.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD, where’ve you been? I’ve been waiting
forever. I’m so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …cause you said…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, I said don’t ‘dress like a Queen’!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh… that makes much more sense. I had a heck
of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don’t want to know where I
put the cord.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY! Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Yeah, we’re closed. So go away.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Actually we have something for you.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your
field trip? I’m thinking of doing a story on your special needs
class.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: I’m not interested. Not after the smear
story you did on my chicken sushi.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well, when 200 students are hospitalized
with stomach cramps I think it’s newsworthy.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Nevertheless, you could have mentioned
the sauce. Well, I see you have a camera.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So can I come along?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Are you wearing a coconut bra?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Oh, you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why are you teaching Special Needs? You’re
the lunch lady.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Dietician! This interview is over. You
can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads
off.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You mean the lunch room?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Well played.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: According to the map, we’re just about at
school.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but we still haven’t found any
treasure.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I think we may have found something even
better.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Our own special bus.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How do you know it’s for us?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the
bus. Here, every row is in the back. We’re all cool!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you sure? It feels about right to me.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nope. I was right.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: TURK, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Special Needs class.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Being a jerk doesn’t make you special.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: You’re just jealous.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And, Ching Chong, you’re not a Special
Needs kid. You’re just a foreign exchange student.</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: I ride with my man.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: This is the greatest class ever, don’t ruin
it.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: I thought I told you to get lost.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Look Ms. Heller, there’s something fishy
here, and I don’t think it’s Friday’s special.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: I wouldn’t know. Being that I’m just the
teacher and all.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You ever have one of those days when you
just want to drive the bus into a wall and end it all? Okay, everyone
in.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Let’s go Margie. The museum ain’t going
to teach itself.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Museum huh, haven’t been there since my
husband left me. I love art.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: This is a much bigger story than four color
pens.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Fun stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Looking for a scoop, huh? I’ll give you
a scoop… of short bus. Lose her!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Loser… oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big
loser.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Uh, no and I don’t appreciate…turn down
here!</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Don’t let her pass!</p>
<p><strong>margie o.s.</strong>: Yeah it started with a pass…</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: …“hi cutie, nice knockers”, then same old
same old.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: That’s great, now make a left, then
straight!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just
wasn’t very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher,
lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Left here! Left!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: You bet I left him, took the dog and we was
history.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Ha! Too big to make the turn!</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: No, it actually fit quite nicely. Well,
except for the fact that it wasn’t really as long as it was wide.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: I think you did it.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Damn right I did it. Went back and set the
house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up
doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the
Dyke.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, I’m not supposed to be on the short bus.
I’ve got a Calculus class.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He’s a dreamer.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, actually I think I’m all better.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Turn here! Go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Again, again! Everyone shouts “Again!”.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Special needs.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, aren’t they just so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Everyone find a partner. You’re not any
good to me dead.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh oh. Captain Rob’s always been my
partner.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sucks for you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who’s your partner?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I don’t know. I haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well… Uh…maybe… jeez, how can I say this… you
and I could…perhaps …maybe…uh… partner up?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You and me? Dream on, desperado.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh. Sorry. You’re right, field trip partner
is a big commitment.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I’m kidding! Of course I’ll be your
partner.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Stop it, you’re embarrassing me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ve always wanted to be a polar bear. Tall,
strong, six stomachs. He’s the most beautiful creature in the
forest.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s a cow, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar
bear milk right now.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Okay, class, everyone gather round.
Mr. Collins wants a picture to prove you were here. And to cherish.</p>
<p><strong>docent</strong>: To fully experience all we have to offer?
Maybe two hours.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Alright. I’ll be back in four. Give them
the tour twice and talk slowly.</p>
<p><strong>docent</strong>: Okay, okay, listen up everybody. Welcome to
the Shea Museum of Natural History. Where your journey into the past
comes alive! She turns and faces the polar bear.</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>docent</strong>: Like I said, Ursus Maritimus.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s not a real name. His parents called
him “Snowy”.</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Also Snowy.</p>
<p><strong>young boy</strong>: I like his answers better.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: LLOYD Christmas - Special Needs. I’ll take
over from here ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s because Ms. Heller doesn’t want you
to know this whole thing is a scam.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn’t
moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there…I’m sure at least
one of them is a mannequin.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh Harry, you’re so funny. Now I have
something that’s kind of delicate…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, you want to talk about your
delicates?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Are you trying to be funny? Or are you
actually re–, re…special</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose
for the class is special.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You and Lloyd chose the class!?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Come over around seven.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: O’clock?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sorry about that Harry, first time I’ve
brought a friend up there. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yea!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Who cares? Chicks are for fags.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think she wants me to come over to put me
into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that
means.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh yeah, buddy, you’re gonna get “some”.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Some what?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You know… She’s gonna be all over you like a
barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt… Eeeww, it’s so
faggy I can’t even talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can
talk to.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sure I do. On one condition.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can’t marry my mom.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s really not up to you, Harry. But we just
want you to feel like you’re part of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Alright, if you really want to go down this
road, well girl’s like chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello, Jessica. It’s nice to see you,
Jessica. No that’s not right. JESSICA, hi. It’s Harry, remember me from
before? No, that’s stupid. JESSICA, hello. Hello, Jessica. JESSICA
Jessica Jessica. Mrs. HARRY Jessica. Mr. Harry Jessica.
J-e-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i–</p>
<p><strong>jessica o.s.</strong>: HARRY!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY, let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wipe your feet. My parents are totally
anal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ooh gross.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Would you like something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, but I’m buying.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Okay, there’s a lot for us to go over, so
it may get hard for you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard
for me? You had questions?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I checked with the school board, she’s not
an accredited teacher.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s okay. Lloyd’s really the one teaching
the class.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She says that she’s got more important things
to do now that the new mall opened.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Sit down, I have something to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you what I think. I think
she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I
think they’ve been doing it for years.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wow, She’s really making me feel hot. Must be
those feelings Lloyd was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And if that’s not bad enough, I think your
so-called ‘Special Needs class’ is all a scam! But I just need
proof.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know how long I can sit here. I
didn’t think the first time would hurt so much… Especially in the
ass.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What? Well now I’m in a position where I
may just heed your help.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Po, po, position…? Hey, here’s thought, have
you a bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Just down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very good. Back in a jiff.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you kidding? I couldn’t be more okay.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: My mom wants to know if you can stay for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you kidding? I’ll be down in a
“I-crapped-my-pants.”</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>jessica o.s.</strong>: HARRY, are you coming down?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just… cleaning up.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd o.s.</strong>: HARRY!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Just wanted to see how your doing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I kinda screwed things up.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I’m sure you’re overreacting.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re always your harshest critic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She wants me to stay for dinner, I don’t know
what to say to her.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the
dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good - thanks Lloyd! I’ll meet you
downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What are you wearing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I, uh… changed for dinner. I get dressed for
all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal. Boy, it’s hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes, what?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Don’t answer me. Say what I say.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Okay, what?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You have beautiful eyes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You have beautiful eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well I was born in St. Louis.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Do you want me to pet your head?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you want me to pet your head?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I bet you want your head scratched.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I bet you want your head scratched.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, why? I think we still have more to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Don’t snap at me like that. You’re lucky I
don’t punch you right in the face.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t snap at me like that. You’re lucky I
don’t punch you right in the face.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Now what are you staring at, you ugly
monkey?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: Uh… not a great first impression…
Dinner’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Then what are we doing sitting around
yapping? Let’s eat!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: The name’s Walter.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well la de da.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey? Hello? It’s me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: LLOYD?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Checking up on my friend, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh Harry’s doing just fine, he’s just about
to open up.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: We’ve got some margarine too if you’d
like to scoop it out of the tub.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, I’m fine thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: Well save room for Mrs. Matthews
famous baked brisket.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Famous? I’ve never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom</strong>: You know, they make that suit for
women, too.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her
bones.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: So, have you given him “some” yet?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You know, “some”. The fag stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY and I have been talking about school.
In fact, I want to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I know, you want go for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where’d that come from? He holds up a giant
key chain.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a
key to every room in the school.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So could you get us into the principal’s
office?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Principal’s office? Yeah, I guess I can swing
that.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh, Lloyd! That’s it. Maybe I’ll get my
story after all!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: …now let’s just have a quiet dinner,
and forget this ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom/ jessica’s dad</strong>:
Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom</strong>: I’ll get the carpet cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: I’ll get some towels!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Two-timing slut!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: Oh my God, he shit everywhere!
There’s shit everywhere! Oh my God. Get up here. There’s shit on the
window. Son of a bitch. He shit all over my bathroom. Shit. Shit- shit-
shit.</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom</strong>: Aaaahh. Shit! Oh my God. It’s all
poo. There’s poo everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So, when can we do it?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom o.s.</strong>: Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad o.s.</strong>: Look!! It’s all shit! He shit
all over! There’s shit everywhere!!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s mom</strong>: Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was an idiot to ever leave the house, go to
school, meet new friends. That won’t happen again, will it, Captain? And
you know why…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Won’t be long now.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: … And that, ladies, is why God gave women two
breasts instead of three. Although you’re OK.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh, baby, you’re the bestest.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh, go on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne o.s.</strong>: Oh, Lloyd…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Mrs. D! I was hoping you’d show up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Oh honey, I wouldn’t miss this for the
world.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Have you got what I want?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: You know I do!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh yeah, give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: LLOYD, I finished all of your homework.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: Get lost sister he’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: In your dreams! I saw him first!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: You only want him for his hot rack.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well you only want him because he’s a
genius like Albert Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Girls! Girls! Please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dunne</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s too close to call. Okay next contest,
now lets…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD, what are you doing? That’s JESSICA
and… my mom.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, this is my fantasy! I suggest you
leave - before I imagine something horrible.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack.
Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oopsy-daisy.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: LLOYD, did you just fart?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Well, something stinks.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Maybe it’s this mix tape I made you. Or maybe
these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Uh, thanks. God I’m so excited! So, are you
ready to take me to the principal’s office? He whips out the key, she
takes it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: So no small talk? Good, ’cause I don’t know
how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan. Got any
hobbies? How ’bout this weather?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Let’s just do it and get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh, wow. Straight to the business. But okay,
I’ll get ready.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m so close I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Me too. I’m almost there.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s it. I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy
it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, it was a complete waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: This is so embarrassing, it’s never happened
before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s my boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Boyfriend? What about all that talk about
riding my waxer?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thanks, Lloyd. But I didn’t find what I was
looking for. Oh can you do me a favor and clean up? Collins can’t know
we were here.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Don’t worry! I don’t kiss and tell. Ooh,
messy.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh. My. God. The treasure chest. This must be
the chest Harry’s been looking for. This is it. I found HARRY’s
treasure! Harry! Harry!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY! Harry! I should probably do this
yelling at Harry’s house.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY! I found the treasure!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Go away, assface.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like
on your map!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, right. Why don’t you show it to your
“girlfriend”?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: JESSICA and I are through. I couldn’t stand
being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn’t worth our friendship.
Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you hear something, Captain Rob?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Captain Rob came back?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, there’s no reason to use that kind of
language!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a
you-know-what.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That’s
it. You’re out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk’s passing out wedgies,
you ain’t gettin’ one.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, would you like to share with the rest
of us what’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You wouldn’t get it. Just a private joke
between best friends.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Okay, class. Who can tell me who painted the
Declaration of Independence?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ooh, ooh. Call on me!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No one knows?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me, me, me!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: The answer is George Jefferson.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I knew that!</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I have a lot of experience wearing mascot
suits and I can start most mornings at eleven. Except for Thursdays,
when I can start at ten.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Don’t you have school?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Kind of. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Alright, just don’t piss anyone off and
you’ve got the job.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I won’t let you down, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Hey, Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Duh. I’m in your class at school.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh my God, it’s really you. You’re HARRY’s
friend, right?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I don’t know if you’d call us “friends”…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You really are a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: So I’m an “arrrrrs-hole”, eh Captain Rob?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I want my friend back!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I think I have to let you go. And you gotta
pay for the busted head.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD, doing girlie push-ups is not going to
impress me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You took the polar bear out of it’s natural
habitat?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Mommy, where’s the Daddy polar
bear?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He was shot by a hunter. Just like your
father.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD! I can’t believe you! Just when I
thought I couldn’t get any madder at you, you do something like
this…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I
beat the crap out of him this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey buddy, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Must be jealous of our polar wear.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Baby, I’m going to spend the morning at
the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking
for?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: The chest! The chest that I put
my papers in.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: What papers?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: The documents. The photos! The
tapes! The evidence.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: The evidence of what?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Sweetheart keep up with me for
half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence
that’s going to put us away for twenty years.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I don’t know where it is. It’s
not here. It’s been stolen.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Wait a minute, I think I know who stole
it.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: No you don’t know who stole it.
Just let me do the thinking.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: It was Jessica. That girl who tried to
follow me on the field trip.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: JESSICA. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: She’s been snooping around a lot, asking
questions.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Okay, I’ll take care of
Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Are you going to kill her?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Why don’t you see to it the kids
are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little
visit.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: So, any ideas for a float?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A raft.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: A blimp.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A turd.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Not things that float. Ideas for a
float. Can we hear from anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they’re used to me
teaching.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: People! Come on. “Parade” float.</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka
powww.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: She’s saying… a beautiful swan…</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: Sleeeeew sheek baw…</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: … flying gracefully… over the rice fields.</p>
<p><strong>ching chong</strong>: Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh
che.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: … to the tune of “Only the Lonely” by Roy
Orbison.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Focus. This is for Thanksgiving. Now
think hard - what are you all thankful for?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: George Washington!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hello, he only invented money!</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: That’s not bad. How about a float of
George Washington crossing the Delaware?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Or maybe crossing a river!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Like the Atlantic!</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: So it’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: You mean we have to parade around in front of
everyone?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: On a float of George Washington?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: This is gonna be the best Thanksgiving
ever!</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: We’re gonna look like idiots.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Did I mention if you don’t make a float,
there’ll be no Special Needs class next semester?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: You had some questions.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And
Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Poor question. Too wordy. A good
question gets right to the point. Example, where’s my chest?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Oh I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: My parents are going to wonder where I
am.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: One phone call from the principal
will take care of that, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Hello? It’s me, Brenda. Jessica’s
friend. She wanted me to call you and tell you we’re going to the
liberry… yes - Brenda…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon.
And now the reward.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you mean? We can’t go in there or
we’ll be “it”.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: If you have to ask, you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, that’s why I asked.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You certainly did.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sorry, no further questions.</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Go in there and get us two slushees.</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: Yeah, deal. Give me the two
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Ha! I said “doll-hairs.” Psych! But a deal’s
a deal, my friend. In you go.</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: Fine. Give me the doll hairs.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Uh-oh. Harry?</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: A deal’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Would you take five bucks instead?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Yes Mrs. Matthews, we have lots
of studying to do so we’re going to pull an all nighter… No, we’re not
meeting boys. If only.</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: Slushee!/ Yum!</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: That guy told me to give you
this.</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: Awww./ Nooo.</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: And grow up.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He said that?</p>
<p><strong>ten year-old kid</strong>: No, that’s from me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Am not.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are, too.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: D2.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s okay. I want the rush.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No. Look.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, it’s Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That must be her boyfriend’s car.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: PRINCIPAL COLLINS is her boyfriend!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Now it makes total sense why she didn’t want
him to know we were in his office the other night.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No wonder we both struck out with her. Who
can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest
office in the land?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He’s like the Pope. Like we’re gonna snake a
girl away from the Pope.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, let’s go spy on them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh my god, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Yeah, I think.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You’re it! Come on Harry, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>cale</strong>: Hey! That’s my shopping cart!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So what did you say to my parents on the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Not to expect you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Cute puppy.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He must be on his way to pee out a fire.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, look. Ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You thinking what I’m thinking?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey Harry, want dessert!</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I’m going to ask you one last
time and if I don’t get an answer, I don’t even want to think about the
consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where’s my
chest, Jessica?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Well, what have we here? It
appears be a tape.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s not your tape.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Then where did you get this not
my tape.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: THAT’S NOT YOUR TAPE.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Don’t play with me dear, you’re
way out of your league.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: JESSICA!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Looks like the best man won.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us your boyfriend was
Principal Collins?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What? No! Look.</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: Kinky!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, that’s my mix tape! You’re using it for
your seduction? I’m flattered.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: … If I may quote the twentieth century poet -
Joe Piscahpo: You look Marvelous…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins’s
office, did you see any kind of chest?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY’s treasure chest? Sure. I know where
that is.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You found my treasure? Why didn’t you tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Three words. I did. But you were all mad at
me and wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I’m listening now.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Me, too. This is my favorite part of the
tape.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: HARRY, Lloyd, listen to me. I only have
time to say this once. Collins is a criminal. He’s kidnapped me. The
evidence you need to convict him is in that chest. You’ve got to take
what’s in that chest and make sure people know about it before the
parade tomorrow and Collins and Heller get their money and leave
town…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: God she’s cute. Look at her teeth. I bet she
could bite through anything. Yes, yes she could.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wonder what Lloyd’s thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>jessica)</strong>: Look at all that hair. She must have
millions of tiny holes in her head. Otherwise it would just bunch all up
on her brain…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So guys, you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: Yeah./ Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Remember, before the parade.</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: Right, right. The parade.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey look, it’s our teacher.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Of course, she’s in on it too. Don’t let
her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has
been doing. I’m staying here.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears
that you’ve snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a
desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. heller</strong>: Well I just have one word for you.
Aloha. The one that means goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine. I can
take care of myself and I’m getting the story every high school reporter
dreams of.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: “My dream date with Principal Collins.”</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wish I was the one writing that story.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our
friendship.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How true. But I still feel I deserve more
than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But my mom gave me the map.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I lugged it all over town!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I made the polar bear pants.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: But I ate your Mom’s pie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I… found that rock.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It was a diamond and you swallowed it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing
to us.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know who we are anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I have no idea - it’s full of files and
documents and tapes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you know what this means?</p>
<p><strong>harry/lloyd</strong>: We’re rich!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Buddy, we hit the jackpot!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of
your mix tapes.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure
chest made it. Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Principal’s log, September twenty
third. Check, check, sound check, check.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, it’s Principal Collins.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That makes total sense. The treasure chest
was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I’m
surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s because Captain Rob is not a pirate.
We’ve been through this.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Testing, testing, one two
three…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Boy, his mix tape really isn’t as good as
yours, Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Check, check, check, check…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Although he speaks pretty good Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s not Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: … Find idiots for phony Special
Needs class, take the Moffit grant money and deposit it in an illegal
personal account…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hmm, I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this
chest again?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Something about showing the world what
Principal Collins has done.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right. She’s so proud of her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: … And that is how I, Principal
Collins, became the mastermind behind this glorious plan. And the
Special Needs brats don’t know anything about it. It’s the crime of the
century.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He’s right. We have committed the crime of
the century.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What? What did we do?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: We never thanked him for giving us our
Special Needs class.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s what Jessica was talking about!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: She wants us to show the world what a great
guy Principal Collins is.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And like she said, do it before the
parade.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A float!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s it. Build him a float for the
Thanksgiving Day parade!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful
for. Screw George Washington!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like
Marilyn Monroe did.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ready Lloyd?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait a minute! Have you ever noticed
Principal Collins looks a little like George Washington?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No. I think he looks a lot like George
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Wait, wait!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or
not?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: LLOYD, what I’m saying is we may already have
what we want.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh. I get it now.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: So the chest is still out there
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows
up, we’ll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out
anything.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: This band sounds terrible.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I sold all the wind instruments.
Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Love it!</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Well there’s a reason why that
mascot isn’t a stallion anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: This is horse?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: No… no it’s not horse, you see I
sold the horse.</p>
<p><strong>toby</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: What’d you morons do? Where’s George
Washington?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Yeah, why’d you give him a makeover?</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Sorry I’m late but I woke up tied to the bed
and…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Guys, this is much better.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than
George Washington will ever be.</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: I don’t get it. Why’d you make him a
pirate?</p>

<p><strong>toby</strong>: We got state money for a ski club? We never
had a ski club.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Collins took two thousand dollars that was
supposed to go to a new state of the art stallion mascot uniform.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I never saw that. Why have I been wearing
this one with puke in the head?</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: We’ve gotta tell people about Collins.</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: I’m not sure if I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You’ll
be fine.</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do
I do if he smells the trap.</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: I don’t think he’ll smell anything - just
make sure he takes the check. I’ve been through this a hundred
times.</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: Well you know Detective, he’s expecting
‘Moffit’ to be someone who has… certain… well…</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: Yeah, I get it. Don’t worry I studied acting
at the police academy just let me do the talking and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>superintendant zimmer</strong>: PRINCIPAL COLLINS.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Ah, Superintendent Zimmer,
hello.</p>
<p><strong>superintendant zimmer</strong>: I’d like to introduce you to
Richard Moffit - former Special Needs student and now American success
story.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: It seems Mr. Moffit has forgotten
his shoe.</p>
<p><strong>superintendant zimmer</strong>: What’re you gonna do. At
least today he remembered his pants. Richard, this is Principal
Collins.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Mr. Moffit, it’s a great pleasure
to meet you sir. And is that what I think it is…?</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: Yes! I drew this.</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: Special Needs.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Aren’t you going to present to
the grant check today.</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: I am strong!</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: I can turn on all the faucets in my house.
Even the hose.</p>
<p><strong>zimmer</strong>: But we don’t drink from the house do we.</p>
<p><strong>margie</strong>: Move it will ya! C’mon I got better things
to do.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heller</strong>: Oh, here it comes. You’re gonna love
what the children have done.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Start the tape, Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Roger that, Wilco.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins voice</strong>: I found a way to bilk
enough money from the school to put us over the top.</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: That sounds like you!</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: Oh my God. They got the
chest!</p>
<p><strong>superintendant zimmer</strong>: Is that a float of you,
Collins? Why are you a pirate?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins voice</strong>: We’ve done it all.
Trilingual education… twelve hundred dollars for fake mock government…
twelve hundred charging tuition…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, good. There’s Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How could she miss this? This whole salute to
Collins was her idea.</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I don’t know what those kids are
doing. Nothing they do makes any sense. That’s why we started the
Special Needs class. And that’s why we need that check!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey there goes Principal Collins!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He’s so modest. Probably embarrassed by all
the attention.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, that’s too bad, this is his day.</p>
<p><strong>heller</strong>: Oh, hello Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Now who’s going to be handcuffed?</p>
<p><strong>principal collins</strong>: I did it all for the
children…</p>
<p><strong>moffit</strong>: This is the best parade ever!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s going to be in jail for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Those inmates are lucky!</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s boyfriend o.s.</strong>: JESSICA!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: See you guys later.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh my God! She’s two-timing PRINCIPAL
COLLINS!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And with that complete loser</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience
has soured me on women.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, we should never let a woman come
between us again.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I don’t think that’ll happen. We’ve learned a
valuable lesson we won’t ever forget.</p>
<p><strong>frieda</strong>: Excuse us… You’re Harry and Lloyd right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Actually, I’m Harry and he’s Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>frieda</strong>: Well, we’re the Felchers. My name’s Freida
and this is Rita.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: We’re going to go check out the all girl’s
college. Do you guys want to come?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets
who, remember? No more competition?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Okay. Which one do you want?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The one on the left.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Damn! What are the odds?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: That’s the one I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Try one in a million!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, what should we do?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You take her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I’m not going
to do it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Look, why don’t you girls go on without us
okay?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks Lloyd. You’re always looking out for
me.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>jessica’s dad</strong>: Not you! Not again! Look what you’ve
done! There’s shit all over my car!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Beats me. It’s Jessica’s Dad - she said he’s
really anal.</p>
