<p><strong>fargo</strong>: a screenplay by</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: And how are you today, sir?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Real good now. I’m checking in -
Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you’re still planning
on staying with us just the night, then?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: - whether they will go to summer camp
at all. Katie Jensen has more.</p>
<p><strong>katie</strong>: It was supposed to be a project funded by the
city council; it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children
who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer
camp. But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Can I warm that up for ya there?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: You’re Jerry Lundegaard?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: Shep said you’d be here at 7:30. What
gives, man?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shep said 8:30.</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: We been sitting here an hour. I’ve peed
three times already.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was
a mix-up, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: Ya got the car?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, you bet. It’s in the lot there.
Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then. I’m
Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, how ya doin’. So, uh, we all set on this
thing, then?</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: Sure, Jerry, we’re all set. Why
wouldn’t we be?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, no, I’m sure you are. Shep vouched for
you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … So I guess that’s it, then. Here’s the keys
-</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, that’s not it, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: The new vehicle, plus forty thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see,
then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep
told you -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Shep didn’t tell us much, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, okay, it’s -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Except that you were gonna be here at
7:30.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, you already said that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah. But it’s not a whole pay- in-advance
deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not gonna debate you, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m not gonna sit here and debate. I will say
this though: what Shep told us didn’t make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, no, it’s real sound. It’s all worked
out.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You want your own wife kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … You - my point is, you pay the ransom - what
eighty thousand bucks? - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty
thousand, you keep half. It’s like robbing Peter to play Paul, it
doesn’t make any -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, it’s - see, it’s not me payin’ the
ransom. The thing is, my wife, she’s wealthy - her dad, he’s real well
off. Now, I’m in a bit of trouble -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, that’s, that’s, I’m not go inta, inta -
see, I just need money. Now, her dad’s real wealthy -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: So why don’t you just ask him for the
money?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Or your fucking wife, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Or your fucking wife, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, it’s all just part of this - they don’t
know I need it, see. Okay, so there’s that. And even if they did, I
wouldn’t get it. So there’s that on top, then. See, these’re personal
matters.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Personal matters.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah. Personal matters that needn’t, uh -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Okay, Jerry. You’re tasking us to perform this
mission, but you, you won’t, uh, you won’t - aw, fuck it, let’s take a
look at that Ciera.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hon? Got the growshries.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Thank you, hon. How’s Fargo?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, real good.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dad’s here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How ya doin’, Wade?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yah, pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whatcha watchin’ there?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Norstars.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Who they playin’?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: OOOoooh!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is he stayin’ for supper, then?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yah, I think so… Dad, are you stayin’ for
supper?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: May I be excused?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sure, ya done there?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Uh-huh. Goin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Just out. Just McDonald’s.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Back at 9:30.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He just ate. And he didn’t finish. He’s going
to McDonald’s instead of finishing here?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: He sees his friends there. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: It’s okay? McDonald’s? What do you think they
do there? They don’t drink milkshakes, I assure you!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: It’s okay, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wade, have ya had a chance to think about,
uh, that deal I was talkin’ about, those forty acres there on
Wayzata?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You told me about it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, you said you’d have a think about it. I
understand it’s a lot of money -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: A heck of a lot. What’d you say you were gonna
put there?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: A lot. It’s a limited -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I know it’s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I mean a parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand
dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, well, it’s a chunk, but -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I thought you were gonna show it to Stan
Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, you know Stan’ll say no dice. That’s
why you pay him. I’m asking you here, Wade. This could work out real
good for me and Jean and Scotty -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Jean and Scotty never have to worry.</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Where is Pancakes Hause?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: We stop at Pancakes Hause.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’re you, nuts? We had pancakes for
breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a
steak maybe. Not more fuckin’ pancakes. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Come on, man. Okay, here’s an idea. We’ll
stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya
think?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: I’m fuckin’ hungry now, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I’m sayin’, we’ll stop for
pancakes, then we’ll get laid. Wuddya think?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: We sat here right in this room and went
over this and over this!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but that TruCoat -</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I sat right here and said I didn’t want no
TruCoat!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but I’m sayin’, that TruCoat, you don’t
get it and you get oxidization problems. It’ll cost you a heck of lot
more’n five hunnert -</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: You’re sittin’ here, you’re talkin’ in
circles! You’re talkin’ like we didn’t go over this already!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but this TruCoat -</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: We had us a deal here for nine- teen-five.
You sat there and darned if you didn’t tell me you’d get this car, these
options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine- teen-five!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, I’m not sayin’ I didn’t -</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: You called me twenty minutes ago and said
you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!
And here ya are and you’re wastin’ my time and you’re wastin’ my wife’s
time and I’m payin’ nineteen-five for this vehicle here!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, okay, I’ll talk to my boss…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … See, they install that TruCoat at the
factory, there’s nothin’ we can do, but I’ll talk to my boss.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: These guys here - these guys! It’s always
the same! It’s always more! He’s a liar!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Please, dear.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: We went over this and over this -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So you’re goin’ to the Gophers on Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You wouldn’t have an extra ticket there?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: They’re playin’ the Buckeyes!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Ya kiddin’!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, he never done this before, but seein’
as it’s special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert
off that TruCoat.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: One hundred! You lied to me,
Mr. Lundegaard. You’re a bald-faced liar!</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: … A fucking liar -</p>

happenin’, see -</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Call ’em up.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven’t
been able to get ’em, so I thought you maybe’d know an alternate number
or what have ya.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, well, real good, then.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Look at that. Twin Cities. IDS Building, the
big glass one. Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest. After the Sears, uh,
Chicago… You never been to Minneapolis?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Would it kill you to say something?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: “No.” First thing you’ve said in the last four
hours. That’s a, that’s a fountain of conversation, man. That’s a
geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I’m sittin’ here
driving, man, doin’ all the driving, whole fuckin’ way from Brainerd,
drivin’, tryin’ to, you know, tryin’ to chat, keep our spirits up, fight
the boredom of the road, and you can’t say one fucking thing just in the
way of conversation.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Well, fuck it, I don’t have to talk either,
man. See how you like it…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Total silence…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, real good. How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You’re damned
hard to get on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, it’s pretty darned busy here, but that’s
the way we like it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s for sure. Now, I just need, on these
last, these financing documents you sent us, I can’t read the serial
numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: But I already got the, it’s okay, the loans
are in place, I already got the, the what, the -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand
dollars, you got the money last month.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, so we’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on,
I just can’t read the serial numbers on your applicaton. Maybe if you
could just read them to me -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: But the deal’s already done, I already got
the money -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have
to know that these vehicles you’re financing with this money, that they
really exist.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, well, they exist all right.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m sure they do - ha ha! But I can’t read
their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, but see, I don’t have ’em in front a me
- why don’t I just fax you over a copy -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No, fax is no good, that’s what I have and I
can’t read the darn thing -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, okay, I’ll have my girl send you over a
copy, then.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay, because if I can’t correlate this note
with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, how much money was that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.
See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it’s being lent on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, no problem, I’ll just fax that over to
ya, then.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No, no, fax is -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I mean send it over. I’ll shoot it right over
to ya.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, real good, then.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: So I seperate the - how the heck do I get the
egg out of the shell without breaking it?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: You just prick a little hole in the end and
blow!</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Okay, here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Awoooo!</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Unguent.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: I need … unguent.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How ya doin’ there, Stan? How are ya,
Wade?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers
are right, this looks pretty sweet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: This is do-able.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Congratulations, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, thanks, Stan, it’s a pretty -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What kind of finder’s fee were you looking
for?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Huh?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: The financials are pretty thorough, so the
only thing we don’t know is your fee.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … My fee? Wade, what the heck’re you talkin’
about?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Stan and I’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: We’re good to loan in.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: But we never talked about your fee for
bringin’ it to us.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin’ you this
deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It’s my deal here, see?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Jerry - we thought you were bringin’ us an
investment.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, right -</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: You’re sayin’ - what’re you sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: You’re sayin’ that we put in all the money and
you collect when it pays off?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, no. I - I’d, I’d - pay you back the
principal, and interest - heck, I’d go - one over prime -</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We’re not a bank, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank
interest on seven hunnert’n fifty thousand I’d go to Midwest Federal.
Talk to Bill Diehl.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: He’s at Norstar.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: He’s at -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, see, I don’t need a finder’s fee, I need
- finder’s fee’s, what, ten percent, heck that’s not gonna do it for me.
I need the principal.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Jerry, we’re not just going to give you seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: What the heck were you thinkin’? Heck, if I’m
only gettin’ bank interest, I’d look for complete security. Heck, FDIC.
I don’t see nothin’ like that here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but I - okay, I would, I’d guarantee ya
your money back.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: I’m not talkin’ about your damn word, Jerry.
Geez, what the heck’re you?… Well, look, I don’t want to cut you out of
the loop, but his here’s a good deal. I assume, if you’re not
innarested, you won’t mind if we move on it independently.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hon?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Got the growshries…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Hon?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, Wade, I - it’s Jerry, I.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Yah, Wade, it’s, I, it’s Jerry…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Wade, it’s Jerry, I - we gotta talk, Wade,
it’s terrible…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Shut the fuck up or I’ll throw you back in
the trunk, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Geez. That’s more’n I’ve heard you say all
week.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ah, shit, the tags…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … It’s just the tags. I never put my tags on
the car. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Let’s keep still back there, lady, or we’re
gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … Hey! I’ll take care of this!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How can I help you, officer?</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: This is a new car, then, sir?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It certainly is, officer. Still got that
smell!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: You’re required to display temporary tags,
either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Certainly -</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Can I see your license and registration
please?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … I was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya
know, to be in full compliance, but it, uh, it, uh … must a slipped my
mind…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … So maybe the best thing would be to take
care of that, right here in Brainerd.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: What’s this, sir?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s my license and regis- tration. I wanna
be in compliance.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … I was just thinking I could take care of it
right here. In Brainerd.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Put that back in your pocket, please.</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: … And step out of the car, please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Whoa… Whoa, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: You’ll take care of it. Boy, you are
smooth smooth, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Whoa, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>grimsrud</strong>: Clear him off the road.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, geez…</p>

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Aw, you can sleep, hon.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Ya gotta eat a breakfast…</p>

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Aw, Norm.</p>

<p><strong>norm</strong>: Love ya, Margie.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Love ya, hon.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hon?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Prowler needs a jump.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hiya, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Margie. Thought you might need a little
warm-up.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah, thanks a bunch. So what’s the deal, now?
Gary says triple homicide?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of’m’re over
here.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Well - it’s cold, Margie.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Ah, geez. So… Aw, geez. Here’s the second
one… It’s in the head and the … hand there, I guess that’s a defensive
wound. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Where’s the state trooper?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Back there a good piece. In the ditch next to
his prowler.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone
over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a
high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’d be very surprised if our suspect was from
Brainerd.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah. And I’ll tell you what, from his
footprints he looks like a big fella -</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Ya see something down there, Chief?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Uh - I just, I think I’m gonna barf.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Geez, you okay, Margie?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’m fine - it’s just morning sickness.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Well, that passed.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah. Now I’m hungry again.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You had breakfast yet, Margie?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah? Well, what now, d’ya think?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Let’s go take a look at that trooper.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: There’s two of ’em, Lou!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah, this guy’s smaller than his buddy.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh, yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: For Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: How’s it look, Marge?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well, he’s got his gun on his hip there, and
he looks like a nice enough guy. It’s a real shame.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You haven’t monkeyed with his car there, have
ya?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little
guy sat in there, waitin’ for his buddy t’come back.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah, woulda been cold out here.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You don’t think he’s mixed up in -</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night
crawlers.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You look in his citation book?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: … Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at
2:18 a.m. Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him
or shot him before he could finish fillin’ out the tag number.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: So I got the state lookin’ for a Ciera with a
tag startin’ DLR. They don’t got no match yet.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’m not sure I agree with you a hunnert
percent on your policework, there, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had
dealer plates. DLR?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: … Geez.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy
who couldn’t afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name
to J2L 4685?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah, that’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: - All’s I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a
professional!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No! They said no cops! They were darned clear
on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well, a course they’re gonna say that! But
where’s my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a
million dollars, where’s my guarantee they’re gonna let her go.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, they -</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And
there they are, they got my daughter!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade.
Ya give ‘em what they want, why wont’ they let her go? You gotta listen
to me on this one, Wade.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Heck, you don’t know! You’re just whistlin’
Dixie here! I’m sayin’, the cops, they can advise us on this! I’m sayin’
call a professional!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No! No cops! That’s final! This is my deal
here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I gotta tell ya, Wade, I’m leanin’ to Jerry’s
viewpoint here.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well -</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We gotta protect Jean. These - we’re not
holdin’ any cards here, Wade, they got all of ’em. So they call the
shots.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re darned tootin’!</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Ah, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I’m tellin’ ya.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Well… Why don’t we…</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: … Stan, I’m thinkin’ we should offer ’em half
a million.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We’re not horse-trading here, Wade, we just
gotta bite the bullet on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah!</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What’s the next step here, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They’re gonna call, give me instructions for
a drop. I’m supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>wade</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: How was everything today?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, real good now.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Okay. We’ll get the money together. Don’t
worry about it, Jerry. Now, d’you want anyone at home, with you, until
they call?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, I - they don’t want - they’re just
s’posed to be dealin’ with me, they were real clear.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ya know, they said no one listenin’ in,
they’ll be watchin’, ya know. Maybe it’s all bull, but like you said,
Stan, they’re callin’ the shots.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all
right?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, geez, Scotty. I’ll go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … How ya doin’ there, Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Dad! What’re they doing? Wuddya think they’re
doin’ with Mom?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s okay, Scotty. They’re not gonna want to
hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, no, nothin’s goin’ wrong here. Grandad
and I, we’re - we’re makin’ sure this gets handled right.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Dad, I really think we should call the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No! We can’t let anyone know about this
thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he’ll
tell ya the same thing!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah, but -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We’re gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta
play ball. Ya know, that’s the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,
you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … That’s the best we can do here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hiya, hon.</p>

entering a painting this year.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Aw, hon, you’re better’n them.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: They’re real good.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They’re good, Norm, but you’re better’n
them.</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Yah, ya think?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Ah, ya got Arbie’s all o’er me.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hiya, Norm, how’s the paintin’ goin’?</p>
<p><strong>norm</strong>: Not too bad. You know.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: How we doin’ on that vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No motels registered any tan Ciera last night.
But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a
Ciera and leavin’ the tag space blank.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Geez, that’s a good lead. The Blue Ox, that’s
that trucker’s joint out there on I-35?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two
guys had company.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, yah?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where you girls from?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: Chaska.</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: LeSeure. But I went to high school in
White Bear Lake.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas
looked like.</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: Well, the little guy, he was kinda
funny-looking.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: In what way?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: I dunno. Just funny-looking.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Can you be any more specific?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: I couldn’t really say. He wasn’t
circumcised.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Was he funny-looking apart from that?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So you were having sex with the little fella,
then?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Is there anything else you can tell me about
him?</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: No. Like I say, he was funny-looking.
More’n most people even.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: And what about the other fella?</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: He was a little older. Looked like the
Marlboro man.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah?</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: Yah. Maybe I’m sayin’ that cause he
smoked Marlboros.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: A subconscious-type thing.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah, that can happen.</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: They said they were goin’ to the Twin
Cities?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, yah?</p>
<p><strong>hooker two</strong>: Yah.</p>
<p><strong>hooker one</strong>: Yah. Is that useful to ya?</p>

<p><strong>stan</strong>: Wade’s got a point there. I’ll handle the call

Gunderson from up Brainerd, we spoke - Yah. Well, actually I’m in town

Well, maybe I’ll go visit with him if I have the… No, I can find that…
Well, thanks a bunch. Say, d’ya happen to know a good place for lunch in
the downtown area?… Yah, the Radisson… Oh, yah? Is it reasonable?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, I decided not to park here.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: … What do you mean, you decided not to
park here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park
here.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You, uh… I’m sorry, sir, but -</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I decided not to - I’m, uh, not taking the
trip as it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, we do have to charge you
the four dollars.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled
in here!</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Well, see, there’s a minimum charge of
four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I guess you think, ya know, you’re an
authority figure. With that stupid fucking uniform. Huh, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … King Clip-on Tie here. Big fucking man.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … You know, these are the limits of your life,

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past
three in the morning. It’s just hard for me to believe you can’t
remember anyone calling.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Now, I know you’ve had some problems,
struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on
parole -</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well, associating with criminals, if you’re
the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your
parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors,
but nothing in the nature of a homicide…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … I know you don’t want to be an accessory to
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>shep</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So you think you might remember who those
folks were who called ya?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Mr. Lundegaard?</p>

Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if
you’ve had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of

<p><strong>man</strong>: Yah, right-o.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: … So, I’m tendin’ bar there at Ecklund
&amp;&amp; Swedlin’s last Tuesday and this little guy’s drinkin’ and he
says, ‘So where can a guy find some action - I’m goin’ crazy down there
at the lake.’ And I says, ‘What kinda action?’ and he says, ‘Woman
action, what do I look like,’ And I says ‘Well, what do I look like, I
don’t arrange that kinda thing,’ and he says, ‘I’m goin’ crazy out there
at the lake’ and I says, ‘Well, this ain’t that kinda place.’</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So he says, ‘So I get it, so you think I’m some
kinda jerk for askin’,’ only he doesn’t use the word jerk.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I unnerstand.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And then he calls me a jerk and says the last
guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don’t say nothin’ and
he says, ‘What do ya think about that?’ So I says, ‘Well, that don’t
sound like too good a deal for him then.’</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Ya got that right.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: And he says, ‘Yah, that guy’s dead and I don’t
mean a old age.’ And then he says, ‘Geez, I’m goin’ crazy out there at
the lake.’</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: White Bear Lake?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, Ecklund &amp;&amp; Swedlin’s, that’s
closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Oh sure.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So, ya know, he’s drinkin’, so I don’t think a
whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out
here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a
story.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What’d this guy look like anyways?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
funny-lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Uh-huh - in what way?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Just a general way.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You’re
right, it’s probably nothin’, but thanks for callin’ her in.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh sure. They say she’s gonna turn cold
tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well, I’m sorry I won’t see ya.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Mm. But ya think he’s all right? I saw him
last night and he’s -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Well, it was nothin’ specific he said, it
just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin’ -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: His wife?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Linda.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Linda Cooksey?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. No. No. They weren’t - he, uh, he was
bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year. Really pestering her,
wouldn’t leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So … they didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. No. They never married. Mike’s had
psychiatric problems.</p>

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh. Geez.</p>

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Geez. Well - geez. That’s a suprise.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hello?</p>

<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, no, I’m kinda - I’m kinda busy -</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I unnerstand. I’ll keep it real short, then.
I’m on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down?
I’m carrying a bit of a load here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No, I -</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah, it’s this vehicle I asked you about
yesterday. I was just wondering -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, like I told ya, we haven’t had any
vehicles go missing.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you
know? Because, see, the crime I’m investigating, the perpetrators were
driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works
here, so it’d be quite a coincidence if they weren’t, ya know,
connected.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yah, I see.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So how do you - have you done any kind of
inventory recently?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The car’s not from our lot, ma’am.</p>

Manager.</p>

<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We run a pretty tight ship here.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I know, but - well, how do you establish
that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ma’am, I answered your question.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … I’m sorry, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ma’am, I answered your question. I answered
the darn - I’m cooperating here, and I…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me.
I’m just doin’ my job here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not, uh, I’m not arguin’ here. I’m
cooperating… There’s no, uh - we’re doin’ all we can…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Mr. Lundegaard?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, heck, if you wanna, if you wanna play
games here! I’m workin’ with ya on this thing, but</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Okay, I’ll do a damned lot count!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sir? Right now?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sure right now! You’re darned tootin’!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: … If it’s so damned imporant to ya!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, I -</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Aw, what the Christ!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Oh, for Pete’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Oh, for Pete’s sake…</p>

He’s feelin’ the interview…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: … Detective Sibert, please…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, so far we’re just saying he’s wanted
for questioning in connection with a triple homicide. Nobody at the
dealship there’s been much help guessing where he might go…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We called his house; his little boy said he
hadn’t been there.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: And his wife?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: She’s visiting relatives in Florida. Now his
boss, this guy Gustafson, he’s also disappeared. Nobody at his office
knows where he is.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than
we thought. You call his home?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: His wife’s in the hospital, has been for a
couple months. The big C.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And this Shep Proudfoot character, he’s a
little darling. He’s now wanted for assault and parole violation. He
clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be
one of your perps, and he’s at large.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Boy, this thing is really … geez.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well, they’re all out on the wire. Well, you
know…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Yah. Well, I just can’t thank you enough,
Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: Ah, well, we haven’t had to run
around like you. When’re you due?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: End a April.</p>

<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, yah, I know that!</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: They can really take over, that’s
for sure.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You have children?</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: I thought you’d never ask. The
older one is Janet, she’s nine, and the younger one is Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, now he’s adorable.</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: He’s three now. Course, not in
that picture.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, he’s adorable.</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: Yah, he -</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where’d you get him that parka?</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: Both of these.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh, no, I can’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>detective sibert</strong>: Oh, don’t be silly.</p>
