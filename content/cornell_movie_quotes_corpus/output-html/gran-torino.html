<h1 id="gran-torino">gran-torino</h1>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: I’m real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She
was a real peach.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks
young for his age. He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had
the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes
that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have
dressed at his wife’s funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER’s
belly button ring.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ. Walt’s two sons, MITCH and
STEVE, watch their father from across the pews.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley. He
can’t even tone it down at Mom’s funeral?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What do you expect? Dad’s still living in the
�50s. He expects his granddaughter to dress a little more modestly.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah, well your kid’s wearing a Timberwolves
jersey. I’m sure Dad appreciates that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My point is that there’s nothing anyone can
do that won’t disappoint the Old Man.</p>
<p><strong>page 3</strong>: It’s inevitable. That’s why we stopped doing
Thanksgivings; the deal with the boat motor, the broken bird bath, it’s
always something.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: What are we going to do with him? Don’t you
think he’ll get in trouble by himself over in the old neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why don’t you have him move in with you?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Death… is often a bittersweet
occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased …
and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits
them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the
beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call life?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus. Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief
and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the
white cloth.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: A lot of people showed up after the
service.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, well, I s’pose they knew there’d be
plenty of ham. I think I’ll go downstairs and get some more chairs.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ll do it, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Naw, we need them now, not next week.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Is that Dad?</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: No, it’s Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo
over and reads it…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: �Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952,
Korea.’</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Where’s Korea?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone
coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit
on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard
look as he grabs some chairs.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: How long do we have to stay, this ghetto is
a dead zone for my cell and I’m bored. Walt stands behind them with an
armful of folding chairs, he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and
Karen are embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Ashley, honey. Why don’t you help Grandpa
Walt with the chairs?</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yes you.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Grandpa Walt, can I help you with the
chairs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll take care of it, you just painted your
nails. Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window. It’s
snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks relieved to get out of
the house.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’d better salt the sidewalk before someone
falls and breaks a hip. Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his
very, very, very old DOG follows him outside.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they
cram into a living room? Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the
garage.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Wow, Grandpa, when’d you get the vintage
car? Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still burning
cigarette before answering.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: I never knew you had a cool old car.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s only been in here since before you were
born.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: So, what are you like going to do with it
like, when… you die? Walt lights up a smoke –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus, Joseph and Mary. Walt pulls the cover
back over the Gran Torino.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: Then what about that super cool retro couch
in the den, I’m going to State next year and I don’t have, like, any
furniture? Walt walks out without commenting.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I’m Tao, I live next door.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?! Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your
mouth. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Do you have jumper cables? My uncle’s car is
old and…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. And have some goddamned respect, zipper
head, we’re mourning over here. Walt slams the door in Tao’s face. Walt
turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich. Walt hates situations
like this.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: How you holding up, Walt?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife and
I became quite close these last few months. She asked that I watch over
you when she passed on. I told her I watch out for my entire flock, but
she made me promise I’d keep an extra sharp eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now
that you’ve spoken your piece, why don’t you move on to the next sheep?
Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Dorothy mentioned specifically that
it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn’t
remember the last time you went.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: It is. Walt drains his lowball
glass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, I confess I never much liked church and
only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess
to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Walt leans over a car that contains
two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to
Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’d really like to help, Dad, but we have to
get the kids home, they’re getting restless. Walt just looks at the
TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted
glance.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Fine. Go.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’ll call in a few, see how you’re doing.
Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Kill you to buy American.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Did you see him look at the truck? It’s
always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom’s funeral, he
can’t let it go.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: At least he didn’t say anything this
time.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: He didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a
Ford plant for twenty- eight years.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: And I suppose that’s my goddamned fault?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians.</p>
<p>****: Tao’s Grandmother complains to a MAN.</p>
<p>****: There’s no man in this house, that’s why my daughter should
remarry. Being a second wife is better than having a woman be the head
of the household. It’s not our way.</p>
<p>****: What about Tao?</p>
<p>****: What about him?</p>
<p>****: He’s the man in the house.</p>
<p>****: Tao’s not a man.</p>
<p>****: Look at him in the kitchen, washing dishes like a woman. Even
his sister gives him orders and he obeys. The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen
where TAO washes a pile of dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the
sink, without acknowledging Tao’s presence. It’s clearly an insult. In
the LIVING ROOM the Hmong �Soul Calling� ceremony starts its next phase.
An elder, the family SHAMAN, is present and begins the ritual. As the
entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips on his coat and goes out
the back door.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I thought these zips were supposed to be such
hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his age.</p>
<p><strong>page 12</strong>: A few blocks away, Tao rides past a
snowbank when – WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the snow. A chorus of
laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand around the stunned, prone
Tao.</p>
<p><strong>head latino</strong>: Whatta you gonna do, gook? You gonna
�Kung Fu’ us? Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.</p>
<p><strong>latino #2</strong>: Surprised it ain’t a girl’s bike. The
Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>head latino</strong>: You gonna get up or what? Tao doesn’t
move.</p>
<p><strong>head latino</strong>: Tell you what, I’ll let you take the
first swing. You drop me and you can have your bike back. Tao smiles, he
can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>head latino</strong>: What the fuck you smiling at, gook?
Something funny? He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his
feet.</p>
<p><strong>head latino</strong>: You better get the fuck outta here,
bitch. He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow. This time
Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos. The Latinos stroll away with
Tao’s bike.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: three months later</strong>: Walt is going about
the chores of spring cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>page 13</strong>: Walt looks around with disdain at his
neighbors’ houses. Walt’s property is perfectly kept, whereas his
neighbors’ houses are rundown. Walt’s eyes linger on every defect,
gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has
installed a chicken coop. Walt looks down at Daisy –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Damn chinks let their yards go to hell.
Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to
his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t know why these goddamned slopes had to
move to my block. This used to be a nice neighborhood.</p>
<p>****: Why doesn’t that stupid, hairy white man move? He must be too
dumb to realize he’s not welcome here. All the Mee-Khah left in the
neighborhood should just move away. Look at him strut like a rooster.
She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back and spits beetle
juice, which has turned her teeth black.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf?
Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is Father Janovich.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Hi there, Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Listen, son, you’re not my barber, you’re not
a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Sorry… Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So, what are you peddling now?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Oh, nothing. Thought I’d drop by
and see how you were doing. Haven’t seen you in church in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay. You’ve done your good deed, now why
don’t you run along.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’d really like to talk,
Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t think so, kid. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Why? Do you have a problem with me,
Mr. Kowalski?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: No, I do.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The problem is I think you’re an overeducated,
27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and
promises them eternity.</p>
<p><strong>page 15</strong>: Walt shuts the front door in Father
Janovich’s face.</p>
<p><strong>latino driver</strong>: Is you a boy or a girl, I can’t
tell?</p>
<p><strong>latino #2</strong>: What you reading, gook, Jackass And The
Rice Stalk? Tao laughs, but keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>latino driver</strong>: That’s right, you keep walking.
Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man. Why gooks come up in here and
fuck up our neighborhood? Down the street – is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC
with a big SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers. The
Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the Latinos. SPIDER, the
driver, squints and then points at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Dude, that’s my little cousin, Tao.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You sure about that, Spider?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: I’m sure. Do we do something… or what?
Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Your cousin tight with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: No, he flies solo, Smokie.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Okay. Let’s go help out our little cousin.
Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across from Tao and
the Latinos’ car.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You better not be giving my bro here a hard
time or you’re gonna wish you never been born.</p>
<p><strong>latino driver</strong>: Oh goody, more Rice Niggers. The
Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL. A Hmong kid in the back seat
opens the door and displays a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way
out-gunned.</p>
<p><strong>latino #2</strong>: Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go back to
your fucking rice paddy. The Latinos screech their tires and are gone.
The Hmongs in the car smile and congratulate themselves. Tao simply
keeps walking down the street!</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Where the fuck does he think he’s going?
Turn us around and go after that cousin of yours. They swing a U-turn
and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with him as he walks.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Hey, cuz, slow down, where you going? You
should really think about hanging with us, man. If we all stick
together, shit like that won’t happen, with those Spicks. Tao nods as he
walks, but doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: You can’t be such a little girl. You join up
with us, we’ll keep you out of trouble, cuz.</p>
<p><strong>page 17</strong>: Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by
the Hmong gangbanger in the back seat. Smokie takes this all in. He
looks down the street and sees that in a half block, Tao will have to
pass a group of Latino gangbanger types.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You think about it and we’ll see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Came to talk to my cousin Tao. Smokie looks
over to Sue.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Spider, who’s the other cousin? SUE laughs
at the name �Spider.� Sue is seventeen, has long straight hair with red
highlights.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: �Spider’? Is that what he just called you,
Fong?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: This is my little cousin, Sue. Smokie takes
off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Hey, Sue… how old are you, girl?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Mentally, I’m way too old for you. I’m going
inside.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: That’s right, go inside while the men
talk.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m doing, Fong. Sue
rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: You think about what we talked about? A
PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a cigarette. Tao shakes
his head �no� and looks at the ground.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: That’s exactly the point, Tao. Spider told
me how everyone thinks you’re a pushover, how everybody walks all over
you and shit. I mean, look at you, out here working in the garden like a
woman. Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: It ain’t no big thing. You just need a
little guidance. Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little
skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: It’s true, man. Shit, I used to be kind of a
quiet little punk like you, everybody fucking with me. But finally I
said �no more.’ You, you’re lucky, Tao, we got your back. Me? I didn’t
have nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Smokie’s right. We’re family, right? You
with us or what?</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I swear, brother, we’re the best friends
you’ll ever have. And anyone fucks with you, they’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Come on, man. Tao clears his throat and
speaks for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What do I have to do? Smokie points to Walt’s
open garage.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Spider mentioned that neighbor of yours.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Now that’s a car.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Shit ya. 1972 Gran Torino fastback. Cobra
jet engine. Mint. Next to the garage, Walt is bent over planting
tomatoes. Walt notices the Hmong punks looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy
walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says – �get the fuck
out.’ The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up to the
bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: So, here’s where my flock
congregates when they’re not in church.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Hiya, Father J.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrel.</p>
<p><strong>darrel</strong>: Hello, Father.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Hi, Walt. Walt says nothing. He
just sips his beer.</p>
<p><strong>darrel</strong>: What brings you in here, Father? The meat
raffle?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: No. I came down to talk to Walt, if
that’s okay. Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I have to hand it to you, Padre. You are
persistent.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I promised your wife. Walt looks
over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father Janovich.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ, let’s grab a booth.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll have a Pabst and a shot. What are you
having, Father?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’ll have a Diet Coke.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Ummmm… I’ll have a gin and
tonic.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Attaboy. The waitress leaves.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I promised your wife I’d get you to
go to confession.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ, why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: She was very insistent. She made
me.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You sure are fond of promising people stuff
you can’t deliver on.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Let’s talk about something
else.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Life and death.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What would you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’d like to think I know a lot. I’m
a priest.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You stand at the altar and preach on and on
about life and death without knowing anything other than what you
learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it’s out of the
Rookie Preachers Handbook.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I don’t know about that…</p>
<p><strong>page 22</strong>: Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: �Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain,
sweet in the salvation.’ That’s what you know of life and death? Good
God, it’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Plenty. I lived with death for three years in
Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked
seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ’s sake. I did
things that won’t leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I
have to live with.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: And what about life? Walt has to
think for a second. He struggles with his answer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well… I survived the war… got married… and
raised a family.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Sounds like you know more about
death than you do living. Walt downs a shot.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Daisy? The dog sleeps in her bed in the
corner. Walt looks at the clock; it’s 3:48 am. Walt looks out his
bedroom window. He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his
garage.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens
the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home
from Korea. Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a
round with a loud SNAP.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Get in, get in! Tao runs right past him.
Spider guns the motor and pulls in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and
another gangbanger get out.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Get in, Tao.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No way. No fucking way. Leave me alone! Smokie,
Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: I vouched for you, Tao, because you’re
family and you’re with us now. Tao struggles.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: He shot at me! I’m out! I’m out!!! Tao squirms
out of Smokie’s grasp. Smokie yells at Tao as he runs away…</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Don’t fool yourself, Tao. You don’t join us
and bail. Dumb motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Should we go after him?</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Naw, he’s got nowhere to go. Let’s get out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Morning, Dad, it’s your number one son,
Mitch.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s one in the afternoon. The CAMERA now
INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the kitchen of his huge, modern
suburban house.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Right, good afternoon, then.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Me? Nothing. What would I want?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t know. Your wife already went through
all of your mother’s jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: No. I was just wondering how you are, what’s
going on, anything new in the old neighborhood? Walt looks at the bullet
hole in his Hamm’s Beer sign.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Great. Smooth sailing then?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yup. There’s a very painful pause in the
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Well good… Say, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Do you still know that guy from the plant who
has Viking season tickets?</p>
<p><strong>page 26</strong>: It’s stunning. It absolutely sparkles. The
chrome shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and polished.
Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood in defiance. A
couple of Hmong teenagers look at the car.</p>
<p>****: That’s right, ain’t she pretty. Walt drops down heavily into an
old lawn chair and pops open a can of Pabst.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Hey, cuz. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Be happy. We’ve got good news.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh really? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: We’re giving you another shot.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You blew it the first time. We’ve got
another little inauguration planned for you. This time there’ll be no
mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Another big, tough gangbanger with �little-man’
complex. Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I got my eye on you too, little girl.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Come on, Tao. Let’s go. Tao says nothing. He
looks at the ground.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: He said, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Come on, man. Nobody’s gonna get hurt. We’ll
take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Don’t go, Tao.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You mind your own business, girl. Two Hmong
gangbangers grab Tao by the arms. The front door swings open and there
stands a glaring Phong.</p>
<p>****: Leave my grandson alone!</p>
<p><strong>page 28</strong>: I know what you are. Go away and don’t come
back.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: That old woman’s got bigger balls than you.
You always let little girls and old ladies fight for you? Tao tries to
squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair and opens his coat to reveal
the PISTOL in his belt.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I’m not gonna say it again. Let’s go. Now.
Tao is shoved towards the car. Suddenly – Sue jumps on the back of one
of the gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks free.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Run, Tao, run! Sue is slapped to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>run!!</strong>: Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the
face. Tao’s mother comes out the front door. Smokie and Spider pull Tao
towards the car as the other gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at
bay. A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into the yard.
All the gangbangers overreact and pull their pistols. The middle-aged
Hmong Man gets in Spider’s face and is cracked across the jaw with a
pistol barrel. Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes a
pushing, rolling, surging melee. This mess boils over and spills into
Walt’s front yard.</p>
<p><strong>page 29</strong>: And before anyone can blink, WALT has the
muzzle of his big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Get off my lawn.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Listen, old man, you don’t want…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt’s calm
demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers. The guns in their hands seem
tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your
house, old man.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Get off my lawn.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I’m not fucking around, Gramps. Walt spits
out the side of his mouth. He grins.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t think for a second I won’t blow a big
hole in your face and it won’t bother me a bit, not any more than if I
shot a deer. Now get off my goddamned lawn. Two of the Hmong gangbangers
take a step back. Walt senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his
ground.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Believe me, kid, I’ll blow your damn head off,
go back to bed and sleep like a baby. I couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I’m not gonna warn you again! Walt
laughs…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’re nothing to me. In Korea, we stacked
fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags.</p>
<p><strong>page 30</strong>: Complete silence, there’s no sound anywhere
in the neighborhood. All eyes are on Walt. Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on
the M1 Garand Rifle. Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks,
but melt back towards their car. As they get into the car – Smokie has
to say something.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You better watch yourself, old man. The
Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street. Walt looks at
Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front
yard. A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up…</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Thank you. Walt lowers his rifle and spits on
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I said get off my lawn.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Bad dog. Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. No more. The Hmong couple nod, say
something with a smile and turn around.</p>
<p><strong>next door</strong>: Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the
yard. They gesture towards Walt’s house. The women buzz around Tao, all
speaking in his ear at the same time. Phong yells at them from the
porch, but they ignore her. Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao
towards his house. Tao looks like a whipped dog.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why won’t these people leave me alone? Walt
walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands,
indicating they’ve come far enough. Sue holds up a plant.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We brought you some shallots to plant in your
garden.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t want them.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: They’re perennials, they come back every
year.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. You keep them. Why do you people keep
giving me all this garbage? Sue is a little taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Because… because you saved Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, I didn’t. All I did was get a bunch of
jabbering gooks off my lawn.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Well, you’re a hero to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Too bad, they think you are and that’s why
they’re bringing you the gifts.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Just take your plant and leave me alone. Walt
turns and starts to walk away. Tao’s mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to
Sue. They look at Tao and then to Walt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: There’s another thing.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: This is my mother, Vu, I’m Sue and this is my
brother, Tao. We live next door.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Tao is here to apologize. Sue shoots a hard
look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: For trying to steal your car. Walt’s eyes go
wide in recognition. He turns white with rage.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Get this straight, I see you on my property
again, you’re done. Walt turns on his heels and storms into his
house.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Good afternoon, Walt. Walt’s eyes
narrow.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I mean, Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I already told you I’m not going to
confession.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Why didn’t you just call the
police?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I do work with some of the Hmong
gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn’t
you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess
what? No answer.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What were you thinking? Someone
could have been killed. We’re talking life and death here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not that it’s any of your goddamned business,
but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react. In Korea,
we never �called the police’ when a swarm of screaming gooks came
pouring into our lines. We reacted.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: We’re not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
Walt says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’ve been thinking about our
discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry
around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that
won’t leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of
that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill,
killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You’re right, those
are things I don’t know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness.
And I’ve seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their
guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at
war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt
nods. Father Janovich threw a bull’s-eye. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m impressed. You came with your guns loaded,
for once.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You have balls, Father. And what you said,
you’re right. I’m sure stronger men than me have found their salvation.
Hallelujah. But there’s one thing you’re way wrong about.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What’s that, Mr. Kowalski?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he
wasn’t ordered to do.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: There, you look like a human being again.
You shouldn’t wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m just amazed that you’re still alive. I
keep hoping you’ll die and they’ll get someone good in here, but you
just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: That’ll be ten dollars, Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Ten dollars? Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep
raising the price. You sure you’re not part Jew? Martin the Barber
laughs at Walt.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: It’s been ten bucks for the last five years
and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Here’s ten, keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: See you in three weeks, you prick.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: If you live that long, dipshit. Walt and
Martin shake hands and Walt walks out.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: Hey, girl, you come over here and
talk to me. Come on, baby, don’t be shy. Trey and Sue move as far over
on the sidewalk as they can to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore
them.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: Come on, sweetie, don’t be like
that. You talk to me, don’t be all stuck up and shit.</p>
<p><strong>across the street</strong>: Walt waits at a stoplight. He
watches Sue and Trey and the three black guys who block their path. One
black guy flips Trey’s VISOR onto the ground. The Tall Guy makes �kissy
faces� at Sue as he touches his crotch. Walt sits there for a second; he
shouldn’t help, but Walt solves every situation by being aggressive.
Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn. The Tall Black Guy now focuses on
Trey.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What are you �sposed to be? Trey
puts up his hand to �hi-five.� The Tall Black Guy just looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>trey</strong>: Yo, it’s cool, dog.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What the fuck are you doing in my
neighborhood, boy?</p>
<p><strong>trey</strong>: Nothing. We’re going to Red Roost to get some
CDs. That place is trippin’, bro.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What you call me, you fucking with
me, bitch? You think you’re funny?</p>
<p><strong>trey</strong>: Nothing. No.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: I’m warning you, boy. What you all
come up in here for? You here to bring me this present?</p>
<p><strong>trey</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: This Oriental yummy for me? Don’t
worry, I’ll take good care of her.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Great, another asshole with a fetish for Asian
girls. God, it gets so old.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What’s your name, girl?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: My name? It’s �take your crude, overly obvious
come-on to every woman who walks past and cram it.’ That’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: You should keep your bitch on a
leash, put a choke chain on this whore and yank.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh, of course, right to the stereotype
thesaurus. Call me �whore’ and �bitch’ in the same sentence.</p>
<p><strong>page 38</strong>: The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm.
Trey moves slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of
garbage.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: You think you’re pretty funny, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What, are you gonna hit me now? That’d pretty
much complete the picture. The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against
the wall.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: You don’t know when to quit. The
old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them. Sue, Trey and the
black guys look over. Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through
the Tall Black Guy.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What the fuck you looking at, old
man?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You… and your buddies. What’s the matter with
you? Don’t any of you work? I see you lazy show- offs in the middle of
the day, slowly walking across the street or harassing women. Nobody
owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing
little girls around, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: Why don’t you get the fuck out of
here, while I’ll still let you.</p>
<p><strong>black guy #2</strong>: That’s right, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What makes you spooks think you can bully a
couple kids with impunity?</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: What?! Are you fucking crazy?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Look at me, Slick. You’re crazy if you
thinking I’m fooling around.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: You are fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You have to be pretty goddamned dumb to think
you can push people around without running into someone who will push
back. The black guys are a bit dumbfounded. Walt stares them down.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: But you might just be dumb enough not to
recognize that your luck just ran out. All bravado drains away from the
black guys. Walt is a rock. Walt grins slightly and spits on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>tall black guy</strong>: Fuck this guy. He ain’t worth it.
The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green
light. Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt’s…</p>
<p><strong>trey</strong>: Man, thanks a lot, mister. Walt doesn’t extend
a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his
arm. Walt looks at Trey’s outfit.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Go home, clown… and pull up your goddamned
pants. Walt turns to Sue.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Come on, I’ll give you a ride.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: So, what’s with you, you have some sort of
savior complex or something?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What in the hell’s the matter with you? I
thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart. What are you
doing walking around in that neighborhood? That’s how you end up in the
obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it
out of the goddamned river.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: I know, I know. Take it easy. Walt looks at her
for a second. She’s not ruffled at all. They drive.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So, that goofball back there. He’s your
boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why in the hell would you go out with a clown
like that. Why don’t you date one of your… own…one of those other…
Hu-mungs.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You mean, Hmong? We’re Hmong, not Hu-mung.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Right. Hmong. What is a… where is Hmong or
whatever? Sue laughs.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Wow! You’re so enlightened. Hmong isn’t a
place, it’s a people.</p>
<p><strong>page 41</strong>: Hmong people come from different parts of
Laos and Thailand and China.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Then why are you in my neighborhood, instead
of back there?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s a Vietnam thing. We fought on your side
and when America quit, the Communists starting killing the Hmong, so we
came over here. Walt is quiet for few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why’d you pick the Midwest, for Christ’s sake?
There’s snow on the ground near half the year. Jungle people on the
frozen tundra?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hill people. We were hill people, not jungle
people. Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Blame the Lutherans. They brought us here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Still, you’d think the cold would keep all the
assholes away. Sue laughs again at Walt’s conscienceless racism.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sure… You know, you seem okay. What the hell’s
the matter with your half-wit brother? He a little slow or
something?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Tao is actually really bright, he just doesn’t
know which direction to go in.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, poor Toad.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s really common. Hmong girls over here fit
in better, we adjust. The girls go to college, the boys go to jail.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Old hag, giving me the evil eye? Walt opens
the paper to the TV guide section and lingers at the HOROSCOPES for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Aw, what the hell… Walt reads aloud to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Your birthday today; This year you have to
make a choice between two life paths. Second chances come your way.
Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti-climax.
Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What a load of crap. Walt lights up a
cigarette and exhales. Walt watches as the only white woman on the block
struggles to unload her groceries from her car. One of her bags
rips.</p>
<p><strong>page 43</strong>: Three teenagers walk past and laugh at her
spilled groceries. One of them makes a crude gesture behind her
back.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Christ all Friday. What’s wrong with kids
today? Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the sidewalk,
another neighbor has gone over to help… It’s TAO. Tao bends down and
carries her bags up to her door.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Go ahead, Dad. Open it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Just open it. Walt opens the package, it’s a
Gopher Reaching Tool – the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can
pick up objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc. Walt looks at
his son and daughter-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: It’s a Gopher. It’s so you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things easier.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Here’s one from me. KAREN slides over a
another wrapped gift. Walt opens it. It’s a PHONE with really big
numbers for old people.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: It’s a phone.</p>
<p>****: Thank you, Karen.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I just thought… we thought that it would…
make things easier.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, I see that.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with making things less
hard on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Karen’s right, Dad. You’ve worked hard your
whole life. Maybe you should think about taking it a little easier? Walt
lights up a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: And that’s another thing, Dad. You should get
rid of the coffin nails. Walt says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: And the house, now that Mom’s gone, it’s got
to be a lot to maintain, let alone clean… and you’re all alone in here.
It’s worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: There’s these great places now, these
communities where you don’t have to worry about mowing the lawn or
shoveling snow. People who are like you, alert, active, but are alone
and would benefit by being with other folks their own age.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Dad, take a look. We brought some
pamphlets.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I told you, I told you this was a bad
idea.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I know, you were right.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Son of a bitch! He just won’t let anyone help
him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, we tried. Now we can just drop it. No
one can say we didn’t try.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: To hell with him, kicking us out on his
birthday?! We should’ve stayed home with Ashley and Josh. They knew
better, they wouldn’t even come. The goddamned kids are smarter than we
are! Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits for them to
clear out, before coming out on the porch with a can of Pabst. Daisy
comes out and lies at his feet. Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A
dime-sized circle of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand.
Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer.</p>
<p><strong>page 46</strong>: Walt looks at a photo in his wallet, his
and Dorothy’s wedding photo. Walt looks down at Daisy –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: We miss Momma, don’t we, Daisy. A vehicle
pulls up to Tao’s house. A party is in full swing. Sue comes out and
helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the
house. Sue catches Walt’s gaze and steps over to his porch.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hey, Walt, what are you up to? Walt points his
index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: We’re having a barbecue. You want to come
over?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: There’s tons of food.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll bet. Just keep your paws off my dog.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No worries, we only eat cats.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, I’m kidding, you moron. Come on, come on
over. You can be my special guest.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m fine right here. Walt reaches into the
cooler for another beer. It’s empty, just water and ice.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What have you had to eat today, Walt?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: A piece of cake and some beef jerky.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Come on over and get something to eat. We’ve
got beer, too. Walt exhales loudly –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, what the hell. It’s my birthday, I may as
well drink with strangers instead of myself. Walt gets up and walks with
Sue towards her house.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Happy Birthday, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t call me Wally.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: As they say, When in Hmong.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Ha ha. Are you sure it’s okay I’m here?
Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s fine. Phong appears from the crowd and
points at Walt.</p>
<p>****: You, get out. Out of our house! What is he doing here? Walt
cringes at her presence.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: She said welcome to our home.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No she didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, she didn’t.</p>
<p>****: Why is this white man in our home? A man like him brings
nothing, nothing but sorrow and death. Several relatives usher Phong
away from Walt. The relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She hates me.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yes, she hates you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What did I do? A little Hmong girl walks past
and Walt pats her on the head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at
Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?! What the hell are all you fish heads
looking at?! Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Maybe we should go in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: A lot of the people in this house are very
traditional. Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not
even a child. Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so
don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s dumb, but fine.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hmong people also consider looking someone in
the eye to be rude. That’s why everyone looks away when you look at
them.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Swell. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they’re
yelled at or get into a confrontation. It’s a cultural thing. It
expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they’re laughing at
you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good God, you people are all nuts.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey, Sue.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You said you guys don’t look you in the eye,
but that guy keeps staring at me. Sue laughs and gestures to the Old
Hmong Man. The Old Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: This is Kor Khue. He’s the Lor family
shaman.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Witch doctor? Sue smiles and nods.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Something like that. The Hmong hold their clan
Shaman in very high regards.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Boo-ga, boo-ga. Kor Khue says something to Sue
in Hmong. She turns and translates to Walt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what
you did. He says he would like to read you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: He wants to read you. Tell you your soul. It’d
be rude not to allow him this, it’s a great honor.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away. Sue speaks
Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and sits down across from Walt.
He looks at Walt for a long time. Walt stares straight back at him. The
Shaman mumbles to himself. Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks
very rapidly. As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt’s reaction.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Kor Khue says that you think you’ve been
disrespected. You do not live your life. Your food has no flavor. You
are scared of your past.</p>
<p><strong>page 51</strong>: You stopped living years and years ago. Kor
Khue says you’re not at peace. Walt looks like he’s been hit by a truck.
The Shaman watches Walt closely, he knows he hit the nail on the head.
Walt looks pale. He’s been spooked good. He wipes sweat from his
forehead.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Excuse me. Walt gets up and steps into the
kitchen. He takes several deep breaths. He’s pretty shook up.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Je – zuz – Christ. Walt looks around at all
the Hmongs eating and carrying on. Walt sees a young man give up his
seat to an Elder. Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks
and offer tea and cookies from a tray. Walt sees a child help an old man
out of the bathroom. Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue
comes in and looks at Walt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Are you okay? Walt brushes past her and goes
into the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>epiphany.</strong>: Walt washes his face in the sink and
dries his hands. He’s still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror.
Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn’t really lived in 50 years,
he hasn’t relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back
from Korea in 1953.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Son of a bitch. I’ve got more in common with
these goddamned gooks than my own spoiled-rotten family.</p>
<p><strong>page 52</strong>: Walt looks at himself.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Happy birthday. Walt opens the bathroom door.
Sue stands there with a concerned look on her face.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Me? I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You were bleeding? Walt smiles disarmingly.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I just bit my tongue. I’m fine. I’m great.
Let’s get some of that gook food, I’m starving.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Come on, you glutton, let’s go downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: To mingle.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m fine right here. I’m mingling.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Come on, you said �not to leave you alone.’</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Well, look who’s over there.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s-his-name who tried to steal my Gran
Torino.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: My brother Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, Toad. Tao is in the corner, he avoids
Walt’s gaze. Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone. Walt
doesn’t know what to do with himself. He leans against the DRYER. The
DRYER wobbles. Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine. He just
can’t help it. All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a
party. Walt looks up – deer in the headlights.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It was wobbly, but I fixed it. It’s fine now,
shouldn’t wobble anymore. The Hmong kids look away, covering their
mouths with their hands. Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the
smile from his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Rice liquor. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Alright. Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice
liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls. One
particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL stares across the room
at Tao. Tao looks back at her, but then looks away. The Girl keeps
looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair. Tao doesn’t approach her,
but three other young men do. They do their best to charm her. She’s
polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao. Walt laughs at
Tao’s ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity. Suddenly
the Girl steps over to Walt. She smiles –</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: My friends and I were just wondering what
you’re doing here?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good question. What am I doing here? Anyways,
I’m Walt.</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: Hi, Walt. I’m Wa Xam.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wa Yum?</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: No, Wa Xam. So… what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Me? Not too much… I fix stuff I guess.</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, I fixed my wife’s friend’s sink
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>page 55</strong>: I drove my aunt to the doctor to straighten
out her prescription. Even fixed my screen door before it was broke.</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: You’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s one thing I’ve never been accused of. A
bastard, yes. Funny, no. Wa Xam laughs.</p>
<p><strong>wa xam</strong>: Well, have fun. I’m going to take off.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: A pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum. She laughs at
Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs. The three young suitors
follow her up. Tao watches her. Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled.
Walt laughs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Relax, zipper head, whatta you think I’m gonna
do, shoot you? Tao looks like he wants to run away.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I wouldn’t say anything either, if I was you.
Walt sips his rice liquor. Walt can’t help but rib Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You know, I knew you were a dipshit even
before the whole garage deal, but I have to say you’re even worse with
women than you are stealing cars, Toad.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: It’s Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: It’s Tao, not Toad. My name is Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good for you. Anyways, you’re blowing it with
that girl. Not that I give two shits about a Toad like you.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wrong, egg roll. I completely know what I’m
talking about. I know I’m not always the most pleasant person to be
around, but I got the greatest woman who ever lived to marry me. I had
to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever
happened to me. Hands down. Walt points across the room. He sways
slightly.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: But you? You just sit there and watch as Ding
Dong and Click Clack and Charlie Chan walk away with what’s-her-face.
She likes you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She was standing over there, orange dress,
twisting her hair and smiling at you.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You mean Wa Xam? Walt takes a long swig off his
drink and nods.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes you, I know, I
talked to her. Great girl, charming girl. Love her. I love Yum Yum. But
you? You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges. Why?
Because you’re a big fat pussy! Walt drains his drink.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I gotta go home. Good luck, puss- cake. You
need it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. No thanks. No more flowers. The elderly
Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in Hmong to Walt. He has no
idea what they are saying.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No more. Please, keep your flowers. The Hmong
women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring Walt. They walk past him and
set the BOUQUETS on his porch.</p>
<p>****: Okay, just put them on the porch. But that’s it. No more.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What now, Gee? Gee holds up a plate covered
with tinfoil.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. Forget it. Stop bringing me stuff. Gee
scolds Walt in Hmong.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. I’ve had it. Gee opens the corner of the
tinfoil. Walt looks at the food.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I can’t. You have to stop. Gee pulls the
tinfoil off. Walt gazes at the food.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is that the chicken dumpling thing you brought
the other day?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt
looks at his watch. He looks at Sue for the translation.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Tao is here to make amends, he’s here to work
for you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and
now he has to work off his debt. He’ll start tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. The kid is useless, I don’t even want him
on my property. I thought we already went over that.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s very important to my mother that you
accept. It’d be an insult to refuse.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How is this all of a sudden turned around on
me? The goddamned kid tries to steal my car and somehow I’m the bad guy
if I don’t accept?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: My family is very traditional and it will very
much upset them if you don’t let Tao repay… Tao interrupts from the
sidewalk…</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Come on, Sue. If he doesn’t want to, let’s just
go. Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue in English,
Vu in Hmong.</p>
<p><strong>sue/vu</strong>: Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!! Tao looks at the
ground. A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women’s faces.
Their expression �begs� Walt. Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks
disgusted, he exhales loudly…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them
and into his house.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are
like badgers.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Son of a bitch, I didn’t think he’d show. Walt
waves Tao over. Tao barely looks at Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay. What are you good at?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s what I’m asking. What are you good
at?</p>
<p><strong>page 60</strong>: If you’re gonna work for me, I have to know
what you can do.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s about what I expected. Okay, why don’t
you go over by the spruce tree and count how many birds feed at the bird
feeder.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Count the birds?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed
to be good at math, right?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yes, I can count.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You want me to do that?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I want it done right, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: But you’ve got me just standing here. What am I
supposed to be doing, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Scaring away crows. Tao shoots Walt a dirty
look.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s a perfect job for you, plus you people
don’t seem to mind squinting in the sun all day.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What do you have for me today? You want me to
watch paint dry or maybe count the clouds that pass by?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t get flip with me, zipper head. I ain’t
the one who tried to steal and don’t forget it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Go ahead. I don’t care if you insult me and say
racist things. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That I know. You have no teeth, kid. That’s
your problem. You have no balls.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Look, I’m stuck here. Why don’t you give me
something useful to do.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Because unlike you I’m not useless. I maintain
my property, whereas you swamp rats let your houses go to hell. Walt
looks across the street at one very dilapidated house.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wait a minute… How long do I have you for? Tao
pauses… he doesn’t want to answer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How long, Toad?</p>
<p>****: Till next Friday. Walt laughs out loud. It makes Tao
cringe.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Go get my ladder out of the garage.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: When you’re done caulking the siding, nail
that gutter back up, I can see it right out my kitchen window, it’s been
bugging me for three years. The neighbor says something in Hmong to
Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You said it, brother.</p>
<p><strong>page 63</strong>: A very old Hmong man and his very young
GRANDSON walk up Walt’s driveway. The Grandson translates for
grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: Grandpa says he want to know if you can
have Tao clear out the big wasp nest under our porch? Walt reaches in
his pocket and studies a small note pad.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t see why not.</p>
<p>****: Tell him sometime after lunch.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Lord almighty, knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: It’s my last day, whatta you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Take the day off, you’ve done enough.</p>
<p><strong>page 64</strong>: Tao looks disappointed, but says nothing.
He nods and starts to walk away. Walt calls after him…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Toad. Tao turns around. Walt wants to say
something, but stops.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Nothing, never mind. Walt shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>asian doctor</strong>: Mr. Kowalski?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>asian doctor</strong>: Good afternoon. I looked over your
paperwork and I think we should immediately start on a full battery of
tests. I feel that this…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wait a minute. Where’s my regular doctor,
where’s Dr. Fellman?</p>
<p><strong>asian doctor</strong>: Dr. Fellman retired three years ago.
I’m his replacement, Dr. Chang.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: It’s Grandpa Walt.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well, pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>ashley</strong>: You talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m doing bills here.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: He’s your father. Ashley hands him the phone
and he pushes the TALK button.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hello, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hello? It’s me… Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I know. What’s up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS
BETWEEN Mitch in his huge kitchen and Walt sitting on the edge of his
bed.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Um… not much, how about you?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I’m fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Fine. That’s fine… How about the kids and
Karen?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Everyone is fine.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good. There is a long, uncomfortable pause.
Walt looks at some Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, that’s good… How’s… work?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Busy.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Right. I s’pose.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Speaking of busy, I have a lot on my plate
right now, unless there’s something pressing. Walt looks at a pale, blue
pamphlet. Mitch looks at his housekeeping bill.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. Nope. Another pause.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Okay. Yeah, so it’s not a good time right
now. Why don’t you call me over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Okay, it was nice talking to you, bye, Dad.
Walt hangs up. He lies down on his bed.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey, moron. Tao is startled and almost falls
off the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I appreciate you’re doing something on your
own, but you’re the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed
trimming tree branches.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You don’t stand on the top step of a ladder
and if you cut through that branch you’re hacking away at, you’ll end up
kaput. Tao looks and sure enough – a thick, black POWER LINE is five
feet below the branch he’s almost severed.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Go grab the extension ladder from my garage
and I’ll show you how to do it right, zipper head.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Looks good. Good job. Tao nods.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Make sure you put the ladder back when you’re
done raking up the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I know. I will. Walt walks back over to his
porch, grabs a Pabst from the cooler and watches Tao rake. A white Honda
turns the corner and drives slowly past Tao. Smokie and Spider smile
menacingly at Tao as they pass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: This kid doesn’t have a chance. The Honda now
slowly passes Walt’s house. Walt just stands there, sipping his beer.
The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at Walt. The REAR
WINDOW of the Honda opens. Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He
closes one eye to better �aim� his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
several times as if firing. Bang – bang – bang. The Honda takes off.
Walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette. Walt doesn’t
notice, but Tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What do you know about faucets? Walt stares at
him for a second and then laughs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: For the love of Pete.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on
the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and
shakes, it looks like it’s about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan
and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Man, where did you get all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: All the tools and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad?
This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I
have with money I earned.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s not what I meant.
There’s just so much shit packed in here.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You need the right tool for the right job.
Every single thing here has a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Okay, what’s this? Tao points to a tool.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at
things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his
expression.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack
hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence.
Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he’s too uncomfortable to
speak up –</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I can’t afford to buy all this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I didn’t buy all this stuff at once,
blockhead. I’ve lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place
long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yeah, but…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Look, kid, I think I know where you’re going
with this. You don’t need everything to maintain a house. I’m going to
let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and
slaps down THREE items in quick succession.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of
WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who’s worth a shit can do half
his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that
doesn’t work out, you can borrow something.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Okay. Cool. Walt coughs and covers his mouth.
Both Tao and Walt see the spot of BLOOD in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What’s with that?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s with what?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: The blood you just coughed up. That’s not good,
you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject – while
tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So… what exactly was the deal with those guys
out on my lawn that night? Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: A gang. Hmong gangbangers.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I gathered that. What did they want with
you?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: They wanted to take me away because I blew my
first initiation.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are
a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I don’t know. They were persuasive. My cousin’s
in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, at least you’re honest about it. A LONG
SILENCE. Walt finishes fixing the ceiling fan.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So how’d you blow your first initiation? Tao
nods towards the GRAN TORINO.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The Gran Torino? Tao nods. Walt laughs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Christ all Friday.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: See you later, I’m taking the kids to the
mall. Mitch never looks up from the TV.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah, fine. Just don’t spend too much
goddamned money.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I will. We hear Karen and the kids exit.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Thank God. Finally get the house to myself
for once. The PHONE RINGS. Mitch looks at the Caller ID. It says; �Dad.�
Mitch almost doesn’t pick it up…</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hello? It’s me, Dad… Walt.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Hey, Dad. What’s up? The CAMERA INTERCUTS
BETWEEN Walt in his small kitchen and Mitch in his huge den.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well… I… um… I’m getting the old Westinghouse
up out of the basement. Mitch mouths the word �Shit.�</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So… I got it on the dolly.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah, that’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah… And it’s a bit heavy… for one guy.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah… I need a hand.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So are you busy?</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Does it have to be done right this second?
It’s been down there for years.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well… Yeah, I’d like to get on it.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Does it work? We were thinking about getting
a freezer. What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Giving it to Aunt Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Oh… Can’t she give you a hand?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: She’s eighty-one.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: I know, I was joking… What does she need it
for?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: To freeze food. Mitch opens another beer.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Yeah, well, I’d love to help you out, Dad,
but I’m just walking out the door. I have to bring the kids to the mall.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Why don’t you call Stevie?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Your brother lives out of state.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Well, I don’t know what to tell you, I’m on
my way out. Keys in my hand.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: If you can’t find anyone by next week, give
me a call. Walt nods and hangs up. Mitch hangs up and takes a sip of
beer.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: Aunt Mary. Like she needs a freezer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You got a minute, Toad?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I just need a little push. All the weight is
up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Let me take the top.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Naw, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No really, I’ll take the top. It looks pretty
heavy.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m not crippled. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: If you don’t let me take the top, I ain’t
helping. I’ll go home.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Listen, zipper head, now’s not the time to go
and…</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You listen, old man. You came and got me
because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it’s top or I’m out
of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn’t blink, he holds his
ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay then, be my guest. Just don’t let it slip
out of your little girl hands and crush me. Tao laughs.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Don’t give me any ideas.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: That thing weighs a ton.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, but it runs like new. They don’t make
them like that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sell it. I haven’t used it in years and it was
always in the way down there.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Sixty bucks, maybe. Why, you
need a freezer?</p>
<p>****: Our downstairs one died. Walt thinks for a second.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Twenty-five and it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Twenty-five? You just said sixty?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in
the paper.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Kind of ironic, huh?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What the hell do you think I’m referring to?
Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It seems like justice to me. And if he misses
a spot, he’s doing it all over.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s nice of you to kind of look after him like
this. He doesn’t have any real role models in his life.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I ain’t a role model.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You’re a good man, Wally. I wish our dad would
have been more like you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t call me Wally.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, I’m serious. He was hard on us, really
traditional, really old school.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m old school.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yeah, but you’re American.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean? Sue shrugs him
off. They look at Tao for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: You like him, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Him? Don’t be crazy. He tried to steal my
car.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: And you spend time with him and you teach him
how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours
and…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey. Watch the language.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: And you’re a good man.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady. Sue hands him a
beer and Walt pops the top.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So tell me the problem with Hmong boys again.
I’m not completely clear.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more
easily. Date who we want, stay close to our mothers, but are able to
keep a foot on each side of the fence. The boys fall through the
cracks.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s tough. The boys float around. The fathers
belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to.
Does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not sure. No.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: The boys don’t ask their fathers for advice,
because over here, their fathers no longer have the answers.</p>
<p><strong>page 79</strong>: Hmong boys become almost invisible, they
end up banding together and it all goes to hell from there.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The girls go to college and the boys go to
jail.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: It’s more common than not. Walt reflects on
this for awhile, then changes the subject.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You still going out with that clown?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No. I dumped him. He was a dim- wit. Walt
nods.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good girl.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be
women’s work.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is that why I see you out in your garden all
the time? Besides, zipper head, we ain’t in Hu-Mong.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Funny. Walt lights a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You should quit those. It’s bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So is joining a gang, you dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Seriously, you should quit, I saw you cough up
blood.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So, you ever think about what you want to do
with your life?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’ve never thought about it?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Of course I have.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, while you’re thinking about it, try not
to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit. Tao looks down; sure enough,
he’s standing on Walt’s chives.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Put some mulch around the cucumbers. Tao
spreads more mulch.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I was thinking about sales, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: My oldest son’s a salesman. He sells cars.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Does he do well?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: License to steal. I worked in a Ford plant for
thirty years and my son sells goddamned Japanese cars.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You made cars?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s right. And I put the steering column in
the Gran Torino when it rolled down the line in</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Wow, that’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It is, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Does your son come over much?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How are you going about getting into sales?
You thinking about school?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Kinda.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, you should.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: School costs money.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Maybe you should get a job and save instead of
spreading mulch in my garden.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Maybe you could just pay me.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What kind of job could I get?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good question. Who the hell would hire
you?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Aw, go on. I’m kidding. You could get a job,
easy.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’d think about construction.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Me? Construction? What, do you have Alzheimer’s
or something?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Naw, you could hack it. You just need a little
adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You said yourself I’m worthless and I have soft
little girl hands.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s exactly the point. I know some guys in
the trades, but you have to get your shit together. We have to man you
up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Man me up?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yes. And you should ask out Yum Yum too.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You have to learn how guys talk. Now watch how
me and Martin communicate. We just throw it back and forth. You
ready?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay, let’s go in. Walt holds the door for Tao
and they enter. The Barber has his feet up reading a Playboy.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Oh great, a Pollack and a chink.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Afternoon, Martin, you dumb Italian prick.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Walt, you cheap asshole, I should have known
you’d come in, I was having such a pleasant day.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why, did you jew some blind man out of a few
bucks, give him the wrong change? Walt and the Barber shake hands
warmly. Tao is wide- eyed.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Who’s the Nip?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: This is Tao. He’s a pussy kid who lives next
door and I’m trying to man him up a little. Walt points at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Did you see? That’s how men talk to each
other.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: They do?</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: What, do you have shit in your ears?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Okay. You go out, come back in and give it a
try.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Come on, Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I said go out there, come back in and talk to
the barber like a man. Do it. Tao shrugs, goes outside, lets the door
shut then comes back in. The Barber stands there with a sneer on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Wus up, you old Italian prick? The Barber
levels a sawed-off SHOTGUN at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Get outta my shop before I blow your head
off, you long-haired faggy little gook! Tao is terrified, frozen stiff.
Walt and the Barber throw their heads back and laugh. The Barber lowers
the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Jesus Christ, Toad, you don’t walk in and
insult a guy. What are you, an idiot?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: But… but that’s what you said. That’s what you
said men say.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not if you never met the guy. If you say that
shit to the wrong stranger, they’ll blow your goddamned gook head off!
Walt and the Barber laugh again.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What should I have said?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Anything but that.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Kid, you shoulda just started with �Hi’ or
�Hello.’</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Right. You should have said, �Excuse me, I’m
looking for a haircut if you have time.’</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Yeah. Be polite, but don’t kiss ass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Or, even better is act like you just got off a
construction job.</p>
<p><strong>page 85</strong>: Or bitch about your girlfriend or getting
your car fixed.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Right. Son of a bitch, I just got my brakes
fixed and those sons a bitches really nailed me. Screwed me right in the
ass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Exactly. Don’t swear at the guy you’re talking
to, swear about another guy who ain’t there. My son of a bitch prick
fucking boss made me work overtime and he knew I had bowling
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Or, my old lady bitches to me for two
fucking hours about how they don’t take expired coupons at the grocery
store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how
we never talk.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: See? You come back in, Toad. Be polite and
then you bring up something you can both talk about. It ain’t rocket
science.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t have a job or a car or a
girlfriend. Walt and the Barber laugh.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off
when I had the chance.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Just go back outside and try it again. And
don’t mention you’re a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever.
Come in and act like a man, Toad. Tao goes out, turns around and comes
back in.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Excuse me, sir, I need a haircut, if you ain’t
too busy… you Italian son-of-a-bitch prick barber.</p>
<p><strong>page 86</strong>: Walt and the Barber laugh…</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Boy does my ass hurt from all the guys at my
construction job. Walt and the Barber laugh harder.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: If you do this, you’re going to follow
through, right?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in yes, sir, I’ll
do my best.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yes, I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You better, because when I vouch for someone,
it’s my word and I don’t want anyone making me look bad.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No, I’m good. I’m totally into this.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And don’t lay down to people all the time.
Always look a person in the eye. When you shake a man’s hand, you can
usually tell where you stand with him. Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK
GLOVES to Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Here, stuff these in your back pocket.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Just don’t blow this.</p>
<p><strong>page 87</strong>: Walt and Tao walk up to the
Superintendent’s Office Trailer on a construction job site.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon, how the hell
are ya?</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: Shitty, but who’s gonna listen?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not me. Walt pours himself a cup of the bad
job-site coffee.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I already did. This is the kid I told you
about. Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he’s the super on the job. Kennedy
looks Tao up and down. Tao looks him in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: What do we got, Walt?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: He’s done construction here and there.
Whatever you need, he’ll pick it up quick.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: You speak English?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: You born here?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: You got a vehicle? I see Walt drove you
here.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Not at the moment. I’m taking the bus for
now.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: The bus? Jesus Christ, you don’t have a
car?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: My headgasket cracked and the goddamned prick
at the shop wants to bend me over for $2100.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: I just replaced the tranny in my Tahoe and
the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just under $3200.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Goddamned thieves. It ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: You got that right. Come on in on Monday
and we’ll find something for you to do. Tao puts out his hand to
shake.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Kennedy. Tim Kennedy shakes Tao’s
hand.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: It’s Tim. What’s your name again?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Tao.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: Okay. You owe me one, Walt.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll send you a fucking fruitcake at
Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: Fuck the fruitcake, why don’t you hand over
the keys to that Gran Torino.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, everybody seems to want that car.</p>
<p><strong>kennedy</strong>: I bet.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You don’t know the half of it. Come on, zipper
head, let’s let this big Mick get back to screwing off. Walt and Tao
exit and walk back to the truck.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What are you gonna put all your tools in, an
empty rice bag?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’ll need this. Walt then tosses Tao a
utility knife holder.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And you’ll need that. Now where the hell do
they hide the hardware holders?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I can’t afford any of this.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll get it, but you’re paying me back with
your first check.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Cool. Walt pitches a hardware pouch at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And you need this too. That should about do
it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Not to bitch, but won’t I be needing some
tools?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Tools I got, but I ain’t loaning you my tool
belt. You can buy tools as you go.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I appreciate all this.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Aw, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No, I really do. Thank you. Walt sticks out his
jaw and looks Tao straight in the eye. Tao doesn’t know what to expect.
A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his and they SHAKE
HANDS. It’s really quite a moment for both of them.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: Just seeing what you’re up to, cuz.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I’m getting home from work, not that you guys
would know much about that.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: So it’s true? You got a job.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Come on, what do you guys want with me?</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you think? I’ve
been sooooo easy on you, but I can’t just go on like nothing
happened.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You can’t just leave me alone?</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Afraid not. The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao
kicks and struggles as they yank away his tool belt.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Keep your hands off my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Your stuff? You and everything you have is
mine. I own you. Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes
it against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can’t destroy, he tosses
onto the roof of the closest building.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: You can’t just walk away from us, Tao. It
looks bad. It makes me look bad. Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and
exhales…</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: What’s the phrase I’m looking for? Oh yeah,
I need to �save face.’ Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit
CIGARETTE into Tao’s cheek. Tao screams as his flesh burns.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads
in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Hey, I gotta run.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven’t
seen you in days?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Busy. Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao
looks away. Walt tilts Tao’s head up, he sees the burn.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What in the hell happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t worry about it? Look at your goddamned
face!</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I said don’t worry about it. It’s not your
problem. Walt looks at the ground and spits.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Couple days ago. Grabbed me after I got off the
bus coming home from work.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Cowards.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I did everything I could possibly do. They
broke some of your tools. I’ll replace them.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Forget the tools. Where does your cousin
live?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No, Walt, I can manage. I don’t want you doing
anything. Walt is angry, but eventually nods at Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Alright. You need any other tools for
work?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I could use a roofing hammer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Go in the garage and get whatever you
need.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s the last of them. Walt pulls out his
Colt .45 automatic and chambers a round.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: What the hell did…</p>
<p><strong>page 94</strong>: Walt kicks open the door and grabs Smokie
by the collar. Walt drags the 105 pound Smokie out of his house and
tosses him off the front porch onto the front sidewalk. Smokie is
stunned. Walt kicks him hard in the ribs.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: How the fuck did you get here?!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You aren’t that hard to track down. Walt boots
him again. Smokie curls up in the fetal position.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: What do you want? Walt kicks him a second
time.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I came to give you a chance. SOMETHING comes
out of the shadows under the porch. Walt swings the barrel of the big
Colt .45 at the movement. It’s a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie
exhales.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s just you and me. Nobody knows or has to
know I was here. You lay off Tao. Tell your guys he ain’t worth it or
whatever the hell you want. You don’t talk to him, you don’t go near
him. This is your one chance. You lay off and no one will ever be the
wiser. Smokie says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll take that as a yes. I don’t want to come
back here. But if I do, believe me, it’ll be goddamned ugly. Walt kicks
Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How do you want your dog… I mean steaks
cooked? Medium, medium well?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Funny. Walt pops open a beer and grabs an
appetizer that Vu made.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is this Hmoog or Laab?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Laab.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Isn’t it usually a little spicier? Tao, Wa Xam
and Sue laugh.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Oh whatever, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It does. Usually it’s got more zing.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Jesus Christ, look at you. I’ve never seen you
like this.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Look at you smile, old man. Kicking back,
having a good old time. You’re sure pleased with yourself today.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: And it’s a little unnerving if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Aw, go on.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No, admit it. You are. You’re feeling pretty
good, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Well, who wouldn’t? I’m surrounded by
beautiful women, it’s a beautiful day. Great food, good friends. Hell,
even Toad isn’t driving me nuts for once.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: It never ends.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m just kidding. Let me tell you something,
Yum-Yum. If Tao doesn’t ask you out soon, I will.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Don’t listen to him, Wa Xam. He’s a white
devil.</p>
<p>****: I’d love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ll be damned. Movie? Dinner? Wa Xam and Tao
nod. They’re a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Yeah, they’re taking the bus.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: The bus?! That’s no good. A charming young
lady like this deserves to go in style.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Like what? Take a limo? Walt nods towards the
GRAN TORINO.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: The Gran Torino? You’d let me drive it?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sure. Why not.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Really? Walt smiles.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Really. They shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao,
where’s Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his
neck. He’s stunned.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Oh no. Walt lays Tao down and rips open the
collar of his shirt. Walt probes around Tao’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What… what is it?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hang on… you’re just cut, is all.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Is everybody else okay?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah. Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in
the walls. Tao follows his gaze.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: It’s a miracle no one was killed.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: They aimed high. Sure enough – most of the
bullet holes are above head level on the walls.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Where’s Sue?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: She went to our aunt’s.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Call her.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I said call her. Get the goddamned phone and
call and see if she’s there. Tao scrambles for the phone and dials. Tao
speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to speak faster. He looks
at Walt and shakes his head �no.� For once – Vu and Phong understand
what Walt was talking about. There is anguish on every face in the
room.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: This is exactly what I didn’t want. Damn
gooks. Why the hell am I even here?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Maybe one of her friends called and she just
changed plans. Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to
Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: In Korea I learned not to care. The best
friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea. You harden
yourself. Don’t let anything get to you. Phong looks out the window and
screams. She runs over and swings open the door. Everyone expects the
worst… And it comes like a cold wind – SUE WALKS IN LIKE A ZOMBIE. She
has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are dirty and torn. BLOOD runs
down SUE’S legs from under her shirt. Walt looks at her and the glass
falls from his hand. Sue staggers into Vu’s arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
mother and sobs. Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at
him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao. Walt is destroyed. He steps
outside into the dark.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>page 100</strong>: Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in
an easy chair and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder. It’s the
first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He wails, crying for Tao, Sue,
his wife, kids and himself. He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap
and he hugs his old dog as he bawls.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Come on in. Father Janovich comes in and sits
down across from Walt.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Are you okay? Walt nods.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: The police finally left. No one is
talking. One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ve noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a
photo album and flips through it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as
babies.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You know, there’s no way that Tao or Sue are
gonna have any peace if these gang guys don’t go away. Go away forever.
You know it as well as I do.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You heard what I said.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: They took Sue to the hospital.
She’s scared. They’re all scared.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I know that. Believe me, they all
know that. Tao especially. He’s sitting out there staring at your front
door. You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Yeah, well what would you do if you were me?
If you were Tao? What would you do? Father Janovich shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I know what I’d do if I was you, or
at least what you think you should do. If I was Tao I guess I’d want
vengeance. I’d want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill
those guys.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What would I do? I’d come over here
and talk to you I guess. I know you’re close with these people, but this
pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski. Walt nods.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Wanna beer?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’d love one.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: They’re in the cooler, grab me one too.</p>
<p><strong>page 102</strong>: Father Janovich grabs four beers, two for
each of them. He opens a Pabst and takes a big swig.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Damn all this. It just isn’t
fair.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Nothing’s fair, Father. Father Janovich and
Walt sit for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: So, what are you going to do,
Mr. Kowalski?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Call me Walt. Father Janovich nods.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Alright, what are you going to do,
Walt?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Not sure yet. All I do know is they don’t have
a goddamned chance.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Thinking time is over. Now it’s time to knock
the ass out of those pricks.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know you don’t want to hear this, but you
have to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You have to have a clear head, otherwise
mistakes get made. Back away from what’s happened, Tao.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No. Don’t let me down, Walt. Not you. This is
going to end, today. Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit
in.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I don’t want to sit.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I SAID SIT DOWN! Just listen up for a second
and don’t say anything. Tao sits down. Walt rubs his hands together.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know what needs to be done. I need to
prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I’m the right man
for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4
P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: I say we go now. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And do what? You want to go kill your cousin
and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood.
What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Trust me, Tao. Cool down and we’ll meet back
here at four. Okay? Tao doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I said �okay?’ You won’t do anything without
me. You meet me back here at four? Say �okay.’</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Okay. Tao storms out the back door. Walt pours
more coffee.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I know, I know. Give me a break, it’s the
first time I’ve ever smoked in the house.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: There, all done. Ten bucks American.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I don’t suppose you still have steady enough
hands to give a guy a straight shave, you withered, old Italian
mummy?</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: You? A straight shave? You’ve never ordered
a straight shave, ever.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s right. I always wondered what they were
like. Unless you’re too goddamned busy?</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: No, no. That’s fine. Let me heat up a towel.
Walt hands Martin the Barber a twenty.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Here’s a twenty. Keep the change in case you
slip and hit my jugular.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: So you can take it in right here?</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: Yes, sir. Take about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tailor</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Never had a fitted suit.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Mr. Kowalski, what can I do for
you?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’ve come for confession.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Oh Lord Jesus, what have you
done?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Nothing. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Are you going to let me confess or not?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: How long has it been since your
last confession?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Forever. Bless me, Father, for I have
sinned.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: What are your sins, my son.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski at the work
Christmas party. Dorothy was talking with the other wives and it just
happened.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Yes. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I made nine hundred dollars profit selling a
boat and motor and never reported the taxes which is the same as
stealing.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Yes. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: And lastly, I was never close to my two sons.
I don’t know them. I didn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Whatta you mean, �That’s it?’ It’s bothered me
for years.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: God loves and forgives you. Say ten
�Hail Marys’ and five �Our Fathers.’ Are you going to retaliate for what
happened to Sue? Walt says nothing. Father Janovich looks hard at
Walt.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’m going over to that house today,
Mr. Kowalski.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: It is. And every other day until
you see the folly in what you are planning.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Go in peace.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake
hands. Walt exits. Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his
chair.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Je – zuz – Christ.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Which one do I get?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You ever fire a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary
target.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Put that down. I got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to
sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was
the only one who came back… I received the Silver Star. I want you to
have it.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten
to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it’s similar.
We’re walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: The hell we won’t. We’re going to roll in there
and tear ass.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Don’t be a fool, these guys are waiting for
that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: How many what?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: How many men did you kill in Korea?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Thirteen for sure. Probably more.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What was it like to kill a man?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Go get the Silver Star. It’s in a blue wooden
box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes
into the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it. Tao holds
up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely. AND WHAM – Walt slams the heavy
cellar DOOR shut behind him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a
loud</p>
<p><strong>click.</strong>: Tao couldn’t kick his way out of there in
ten years. Of course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws
things.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of
here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Quit smashing everything. You’ll never get out
of there, so just relax.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will
kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds
back with a strength and authority which startles Tao.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You want to know how it feels to kill a man?
It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal
for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to
give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him
with the same rifle you just held upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>page 110</strong>: I’ve thought about that kid for fifty
years. And I promise you, boy, you want no part of it. Me, I’ve got
blood on my hands. I’m soiled. Forgive me for tricking you like a dope.
I’ll call someone and have them let you out later.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: No! Let me out!! Tao pounds on the door.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You’ve come a long way. I’m proud to call you
a friend. You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what I
do. I finish things. You’d just get in the way. Sorry. Walt goes back
upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his cellar. Tao howls to be let
out.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Aw, pipe down, you hag.</p>
<p>****: You’re an evil man. I’ve seen your kind before. Back home,
white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men’s minds
with ideas of glory. Then you’d lead them away to their deaths. Walt, of
course, has no idea what she said.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Fine, I hate you too.</p>
<p><strong>page 111</strong>: Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She
looks down at Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I need you to watch my dog. Walt holds the
leash closer. Phong folds her arms in defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips the loop of the
leash underneath it so Daisy can’t follow him.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Her name is Daisy. Walt bends down on one knee
and lovingly pets Daisy. He scratches her belly.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You take it easy, old gal. You good old girl.
Walt gets up and walks away without looking back. Phong is stunned; she
is silent for once.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Good afternoon, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>darrel</strong>: Walter, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Never been better.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Beer and a shot, Walt?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I think I’ll have something different. Walt
looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of
Johnnie Walker Blue.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Think I’ll try that Johnnie Walker Blue
Label.</p>
<p><strong>page 112</strong>: The regulars all �Oooooo� and �Ahhhhhhh�
at Walt’s order.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Naw, just having something special. Walt sips
his Scotch and nods. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Why don’t you get all the guys the same.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: I’m sure. This is too good not to be shared.
Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more. Several regulars hold
up their drinks towards Walt.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: It’s Walt. The key to my front door is under
the ceramic turtle. Open the door and go let your brother out of the
cellar. I have to go. The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up
out of bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs. Phong blocks her
path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.</p>
<p>****: Who was that? Where are you going? You tell me what’s going
on?! Sue squirms away from Phong and runs outside. On her way over to
Walt’s house, she sees Daisy leashed to Phong’s chair. It scares Sue
even more.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sorry, Father, we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’m telling you. If we’re not here,
there will be bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We’ve been here for hours. We can’t afford
to anchor a unit to one location.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’m begging you to stay.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I just got word from my Sergeant, we’re
pulling the plug.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No you aren’t. My orders are specific. You
came with us, you’re leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the
duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off. Walt
pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door. He looks
at the duplex. It’s a total eyesore.</p>
<p>****: What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>page 114</strong>: Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops
twenty feet from the duplex. Six very scared, very jittery Hmong
gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Is that all you swamp rats or is there more
vermin scurrying in the shadows? Smokie and Spider step out and stand on
the porch. Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: I wasn’t sure that you’d…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Shut up, gook. I’m not here to listen to one
goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you
has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: That’s right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after
he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for
Christ’s sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of
ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong
gangbangers pull their guns.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You have no honor. You’re the scum of the
earth and when you’re gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will
mourn. You won’t be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt’s absolute
lack of fear.</p>
<p><strong>smokie</strong>: Where’s Tao, old man? He too scared to come
and stick up for himself?</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren’t
worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth.
Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS
around. Walt laughs.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: You boys are a little bit jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>spider</strong>: You watch it, old man.</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: No, I think you’d better watch it. Walt looks
around. Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have
gathered to watch this showdown.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Tao? Tao, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>i’m down here! let me out!!</strong>: She unlocks the CELLAR
DOOR. Tao comes out in a rage.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: He left without me!</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: Where? Where’d he go?!</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: He went to Smokie’s without me. Tao takes the
stairs two steps at a time.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No! No, Tao! Sue grabs Tao’s legs and hangs
on.</p>
<p><strong>sue</strong>: No! Don’t you dare! Stay away from them, Tao! I
don’t want anyone else getting hurt.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>no, tao. no!</strong>: They struggle at the top of the stairs
and spill into the kitchen floor. Tao runs for the door when something
catches his eye… The kitchen table. The RIFLE and PISTOL are still
there. Walt purposely left the guns at home.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: Oh God! NO!!</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Anybody got a light? No? I got one. Walt’s
slight grin fades. He mutters to himself…</p>
<p><strong>walt</strong>: Hail Mary, full of grace. Walt reaches into
his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their
PISTOLS and FIRE. BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream. Walt
falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand. Walt never intended to
kill anyone. Self-sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You have to step back.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: He was a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: I said step back. Tao turns to the
HMONG POLICE OFFICER.</p>
<p><strong>tao</strong>: What happened, man? The Hmong Police Officer
looks at the WHITE POLICE OFFICER and then to Tao.</p>
<p><strong>hmong police officer</strong>: You heard him, step back. Tao
speaks to the HMONG OFFICER in their native language.</p>
<p>****: Please, man, it’s important. He’s my friend. Tell me what
happened?</p>
<p>****: The old guy reaches for a lighter and they gunned him down. The
gang said the old guy was here to kill them, but he didn’t have a
weapon.</p>
<p>****: What’s going to happen?</p>
<p>****: We actually have witnesses for once. These guys are going away
big time. The WHITE OFFICER yells at the HMONG OFFICER.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Officer Chang, get those people
back.</p>
<p><strong>hmong police officer</strong>: Yes, sir. You have to step
back now. Tao hugs his sister. Sue openly weeps. Tao holds it in. He
looks at his friend Walt as the bag is zipped over him.</p>
<p><strong>father janovich</strong>: Walt Kowalski once said to me I
didn’t know anything about life or death because �I was an overeducated,
27-year-old virgin who held the hands of superstitious old women and
promised them eternity.’ Walt definitely had no problem �calling it like
he saw it.’ But Walt was right. I knew really nothing about life or
death until I got to know Walt. And boy, did I learn.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Which brings us to our last item. And again,
please forgive the language used in Mr. Kowalski’s will. I’m simply
reading it as it was written. The LAWYER takes a sip of water before
reading…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: �And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I leave my
1972 Gran Torino on the condition that you don’t choptop the roof like a
damned spick, don’t paint any idiotic flames on it like some white-trash
hillbilly and don’t put a big gay spoiler on the rear-end like you see
on all the other zipper heads’ cars. It just looks like hell. If you can
refrain from doing any of that, it’s yours.</p>
