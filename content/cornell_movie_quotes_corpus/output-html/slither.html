<p><strong>closeup</strong>: A slender woman’s hand writes on a
chalkboard, in teacherly cursive.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: When Darwin said ‘fittest,’ he didn’t
necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait
– he merely meant those organisms most well-suited to their
environment.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: We humans think we’re more fit, more
evolved, because we’re smarter. But we’re neophytes. We’ve been around
two million years, give or take. The cockroach has been here for 350
million. You tell me who’s the more successful species.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How’s all this go with how the Bible says
there ain’t no dinosaurs?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: We’ll tackle that tomorrow… Everyone bring
your boxing gloves.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Mornin’, Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Prolly go find it later, sell it on eBay.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Just a tremor, boys.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Did ya’ feel that?!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I always get afraid when that happens,
‘cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside? It’s so hot
in there you get all burnt to nothin’ like that – Happened to my uncle
Barry.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Who told you that story, Trevor?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: My aunt.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Your uncle Barry left her for a stripper up in
Winnsboro.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Chief! We got a ’mergency over at the
diner!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Back there, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: She slipped in, was eating trash. We seen
it on TV, how they kill ya’–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: So we thought we best call in.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on now, honey, door’s this way.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It’s open season. Let’s shoot her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She’s just scared, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Also, Bill likes to take a female through the
back door any chance he gets.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She ain’t a bull, Trevor!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Goddamn bambi-rat!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Get back.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s okay, sweetheart. Nobody’s gonna hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s right. Just gonna pull this cord out.
It’s gonna be all right.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hell, she took a phone. Now them forest
critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Chief of police there? This a squirrel. Bring
me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: ’Night, Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: See ya’, Ashley.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: So I get home today, phone’s ringing. It’s
Hank Wilcox.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Callin’ for you. What the hell? I said,
‘Hank, that’s a little bit outta line don’t’cha think, a single man
callin’ someone’s wife?’ At night, nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He’s teaching environmental science, Grant.
Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh yeah, that’s what he wants to borrow, this
guy.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: It’s just a work thing.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get
in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That’s where
their minds is at, them sick fucks.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’ll tell you, sugarplum, you’re lucky you
got me. You’re too damn trusting. Without me to protect you, you’d get
kilt one of these days.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sugarplum, you coming into bed?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Just a second.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, no – I’m sorry, I’m just – I’m not in
the mood.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Come on, baby, it’s –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t just have some
switch.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Flip.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Flip.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: That’s disrespectful.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: When are you in the mood, exactly? Seems to
me that mood’s as rare as winnin’ the Goddamn lotto.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’m just some big clown to you, ain’t I?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: That’s not true – Where are you-?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hit me again there, killer.</p>
<p><strong>barkeep</strong>: Hey, Grant, how’s it you come to have the
same last name as first?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Parents thought it sounded pleasant, I
s’pose. Joke on me, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Megan Halesy’ little sister.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Shit. You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Nope. Brenda!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hell, you were –</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I was! And I’ll tell you somethin’, Grant
Grant. I’s in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: My sister Megan, she’s a big fat cow. Was
then, even more so now. I’d be thinking, what’d you see in her ain’t in
me?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Shit, girl, you couldn’t’a been eleven.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hell, I was game!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Who’s the lucky fella?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn
half-Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Already ain’t. Married a gal named –</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Starla Covington. Don’t be ignorant.
Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Starla, she gets real worried ’bout me I stay
out too late. Loves me too much, that one.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hey, anybody ’round here? ’Lo?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Ow! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: Hey, man. You all right?… Dude?… Oh
shit.</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: I think he’s d –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: It’s taking… my… brain.</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: Buddy?</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: You all right, man?</p>
<p><strong>camper</strong>: That might of been a stroke, buddy. You
better take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Hey ya’, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: What were ya’, night-fishing again? You
catch anything?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I caught a little somethin’, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hey there, sugarplum.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Haven’t heard this for a while.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I never danced in a towel before.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Wearing white, just like on our… wedding day.
I remember it.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I’m sorry about last night. I get a little
insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight. It’s just ’cause you’re
precious to me, Starla.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: But I swear to God, baby, I’m turning over a
new Goddamn leaf. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I love you, sugarplum.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Just a little bug bite is all.</p>
<p><strong>janene</strong>: What are you so smiley about, girl?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Oh, nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Just, Grant and I had a nice morning. It’s
been a while.</p>
<p><strong>janene</strong>: Oh! You got that fresh-fucked glow, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Janene.</p>
<p><strong>janene</strong>: You slut.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Hush.</p>
<p><strong>janene</strong>: No shame. You’re a married woman.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He was… considerate. Maybe this is the start
of a real change in Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin’ to the Deer
Cheer this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Sure thing, killer.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: What can I do you for?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Thinkin’ ‘bout getting me a couple of these
big ol’ rib eyes.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: How many you need?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well… having us a little dinner party… I’d
say… eight. No, no… fourteen…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don’t
you just give me everything you got here?</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: All the rib eyes?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yep. And while you’re at it, get me a few of
them chicken wings… some pork loins… and, ooo, what’s this here? Osso
buco?…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re meat.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant? Why are there – did you put locks on
the garage?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You drilled into the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yeahhhh. I’m sorry. I just got so excited
about… your present.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: My present?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re my princess, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I got a super-special birthday present for
you this year. I couldn’t risk you finding it, so I had to put them
locks on the doors.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: All right… I have to clean up before
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re meat.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Oh, nothin’. Nothin’. See you in a sec.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Roscoe’s gone?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: You haven’t seen him, have you?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’m sure he’ll show up, Tim.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, are you almost ready?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Yeah, hon, I’ll be right there!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re pretty.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: It’s just one of my students, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s she see in that douchebag?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s the mystery of the ages there, Trev.
Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his
thirties. No one even knew they were goin’ out till she had that ring on
her finger.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Ain’t no mystery to it. She’s raised in
them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt-poor.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Gold-digger, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hell, you don’t know that, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill, you’re Chief of police now.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like
keeping your people in line.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re right, Jack. Margaret, you’re
fired.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Janene!</p>
<p><strong>janene</strong>: Hey, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Why don’t you two catch up? I’ll go see what
the boys are doing.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He’s been strange the past couple days.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Hey there, handsome.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Must be fate, us meeting again like
this.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Well, you might be right…</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You’re lookin’ awful pretty.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Where’s the old half-Mexican?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Took the kids to his Mom’s for the
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Where you takin’ me, you bad boy!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Take off your shirt, doll.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Guess it’s hard to explain how amazin’ a
human brain is to someone who that’s all they know.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big
thoughts. And love. Yeah. I’m inclined to parlay it into somethin’ more.
So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Grant!? What – ?!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: No, no, we –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Hey, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry. The lurker ain’t around. I
checked.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Whatcha’ doin’?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Tryin’ to get a buzz on. But I’m too buff. Too
much muscle mass.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What you up to?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Just checking out the lights.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Pretty, ain’t they?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve seen them so many times
before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well that’s only if you’re in the wrong
spot.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There’s a place over there on the bluffs. When
the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a
kaleidoscope.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get
there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you, but ’course he got hit by
that train. Me.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’ll get Wally to show me sometime then.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, will you now?</p>
<p><strong>starla grant</strong>: Or Rollo’s ghost. Starla.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: You ready, sugarplum?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Surprised you’re able to lift a mug after
carrying that torch for so long.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Wally. Glad you’re here. There was
something I wanted to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Sir, may I help – ?</p>
<p><strong>brenda’s husband</strong>: My wife, Brenda. I think something
has happened to her!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Damn fuse.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, where are y – ?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your –
?</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Heh. It ain’t as bad as it looks, sugarplum.
Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a
prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Don’t look at me like that, baby. Please? I’m
gonna go get my… prescription filled.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’ll get if for you.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: No! No. Heh. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Grant? Grant, I’m hungry. I’m so fuckin’
hungry I think I’m gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Brought you munchies.</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Been saving for a rainy day.</p>
<p><strong>closeup</strong>: Brenda’s face, still mostly in darkness.
She stares at the meat, simultaneously excited and repulsed.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Grant, I’m sorry if I did something wrong! I
think I gotta – I think I should go to a hospital!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Grant around?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: No. He went to the pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Pharmacy?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He’s got a… rash.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla, you know Brenda Gutierrez?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Maybe she’s ever called the house, or – ?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: No. What…?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to
believe foul play might be involved.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Some kids found her necklace near Tipper
Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The problem, Starla, is, the last person
anyone saw her talking to was Grant.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The Deer Cheer. And Wally and me, we also saw
him that night, with mud all over his slacks.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Have him call me right away, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: You’ve reached Chief Pardy at the Wheelsy
Police Department. Please leave a message and your call will be returned
as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Bill, it’s Starla!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: It’s – I think you better come over right
away – I think Grant’s sick, he –</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Why’d you betray me, sugarplum?!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, no!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I loved you. I loved –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant, you’re sick!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: I wanted you by my side, but you – I can’t
trust you now!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla?!! Starla, are you in there?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla?!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Jesus, these past few days have been a
trying time for us.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: We ask you now for the safe return of our
beloved Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: Our sister. Our daughter. Our mother. Our
wife.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: And we ask that you keep your light alive in
her heart, wherever she may be. We ask all this in your name, Lord.
Amen</p>
<p><strong>bill congregation</strong>: Amen. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I talked to the CDC. They didn’t have nothin’
on file consistent with Grant’s… symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: How about Brenda?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: New? No. We’re hoping we find Grant, he’ll
lead us to her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill, we need to talk!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: ‘Mornin’, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill, this Brenda’s Randy Flagg’s niece. We
need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle
and stuck it up my ass!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain’t my
business.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as
Chief is in dire straits you don’t work this shit out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ll find him. Anything new?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How are you going to find him?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dude’s a half-squid. Ain’t many places he can
hide. Sea World, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That young lady heard you say ‘squid.’ She’s
gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Not today, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Still, quit that talk! You yourself said it
was dark in there! You don’t know what you saw!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: We saw his arm was all bendy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bastard obviously got lyme disease!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a
sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And that makes you look like a squid?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll tell you what, no one with lyme disease
gonna win any damn handsome contests!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, screw you all for laughin’.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Another ranch attack! Up at the
Castavets’.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ‘Ranch a -’? What ‘ranch attacks’?</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: A dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the
long grass, its gut split open and intestines spilling out, almost
perfectly symmetrical.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It looks like one of them psyche tests. What
do they call it?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Rorschach.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: What do you see? I see a butterfly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I see we’re fucked. Three ranches in three
days.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So, I think I got it part-way figured. You
want to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So Grant – I mean, we’re saying this is
Grant, right?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Grant kills a cow right about here. See
there’s the blood, musta slit its neck.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So he drags the cow backwards here. Only
he prolly didn’t know ’bout the Castavets had them dogs.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: He knocked this’n’s head clear over
here!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Put that down, numbnuts!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: So the dogs attacked, somehow he slew ’em
all, and he stole off with the cow into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s gotta be in the forest. All three ranches
run alongside it.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Think we should get up a search party, head
in there?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s a hundred thousand acres. Be finding a
needle in a fuckstack.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wally, come on. Trevor and Margaret, get some
folks together. I think I know where he’s gonna hit next.</p>
<p><strong>closeup</strong>: A property map of Wheelsy is tacked to a
bulletin board. Red Magic Marker circles are around various ranch
properties on the edge of the city, next to an enormous forest. A finger
points to one of the red circles.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So the night after Grant ran off, a calf went
missing from here, the Raglans’ ranch.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Two nights ago, a mare was stolen from this
property, run by Fitzgibbon, that old rancher with the cleft palate.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Looks like a chipmunk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Your momma wasn’t too proud when you came out
neither, Wally.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And then we get here, the Castavets’, where
last night’s shit-storm took place.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I see. It’s like as if he’s going in a
pattern. Is that what you’re saying, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And if he sticks to that pattern he’ll be here
next. Belongs to a family, the Strutemyers’. Now I know y’all are tired
and you’ve barely seen your families. But we’re gonna have to go there
tonight, lie low and wait.</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Let’s get that son-of-a-bitch, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just remember, we don’t know what we’re up
against here. So let’s be careful.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hey, Bill, we got that grenade we
confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t know the Russkies were invading
there, folks.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You seen this guy, you’d wished they
was.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Bill, I heard what you’re doing. I think I
should go along.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why? Listen, it doesn’t matter. I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl’s still out
there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your
best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He tried to kill you, Starla.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He did. I know. But I got him angry ’cause I
wasn’t calm. This time I could –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Please, Bill. What happened, it’s my fault,
I know it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla, it ain’t –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: It is. He’d been acting strange. And the
physical changes. I should have told someone right away… But I was just
blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn’t happening… If I don’t do what I can
to help now, I just couldn’t live with it.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Kylie! What’d you do to your
fingers?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Kiri Goshima done ’em. She’s Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s dad</strong>: Looks like Pokemons done ’em to me!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Foreign stuff is classy if you knew
something.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s dad</strong>: Oh. There’s Jack. I want y’all to stay
inside tonight. All right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This turns out to be a mountain lion we’re
gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots.</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Didn’t know it was date night.</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: I’ll be expecting you toss my salad at the
end of all this then, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>good ol’ boy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Starla, remember that time when you were
a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla here’s twelve. Guess I was fourteen. I
said, ‘Starla, what the hell you doing out there?’ She tells me she’s
running away to Hollywood to become a big star. She said she knew I was
in ROTC, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. Invited me along.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I said, ‘Starla, if there’s anybody can take
care of herself, I think it’s you. I’m gonna have to decline.’</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: How far’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: About the bus stop. Ranger Rick here called
my dad.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Ha! A cop from the get-go! You
son-of-a-bitch!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You fucked up our fame and fortune, Bill
Pardy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, maybe I did.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You said ‘squid’!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It got worse.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: What we gonna do now, Bill? Cuffs won’t even
fit on ’im.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla, where you…?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant? It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You’re just sick is all. But we’ll take you
to get help right now. I’ll stay by your side, Grant, just like I swore
I would. For better or worse. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Okay, Grant? It’s gonna be all right.</p>
<p><strong>good ol’ boy</strong>: You stop right there, you son of a
bitch. I don’t care what kinda leprosy you got. We need to find that
girl. Now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fire! Fire!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: There he is! Over there!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: We ain’t never gonna find that girl
now.</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: I’ll kill that asshole what he did to
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla, get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Bill!!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What the hell’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: It’s something dead.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s coming from in there, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Think he’s inside?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Something’s wrong with me.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Brenda, um…</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I didn’t want no one to be seeing me like
this.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: How are my boys, Bill? Are they all
right?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Boys are fine, Brenda. Uh, what’s – what’s
happening here, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I’m so fucking hungry, Bill. I’m so hungry.
I just never knew anybody could be so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Would you mind handing me a piece of that
possum there at your feet? Little bit?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think we best get you to a hospital right
quick.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: What the fuck they gonna do with her in a
hospital, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Why’s she doing that?!</p>
<p><strong>redneck</strong>: Her tumors is moving.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bill, get her to stop that shit!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It hurts!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Help me!! Help!!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr- !</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He led us here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Margaret, cover your mouth!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t let ’em in your mouths!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: They wanted us to eat ’em! Why would they
want that!?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Kylie! You’re gonna turn into a plum in
there!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Prune, Mom. Plums turn into prunes.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: I know what turns into what. You got
school tomorrow. Finish up in there and get to bed.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Time to turn in, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s sister 1</strong>: Just a couple more pages, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Come on now.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: G’night.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s sister 1 kylie’s sister 2</strong>: Night, Mom.
Night.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Sleep tight. Don’t let the bed bugs
bite.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Mom!!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Mom!!!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Mom!! Mom!!!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Emily!! Jenna!!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: No!! Nooo!!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: 11-41. We’re gonna need paramedics out here
right away. We got four men down.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby, you there?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby, this is Bill. We got an emergency
here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Praise Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: ‘Praise Jesus?’ That’s fucking pushing it,
Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What the hell were those things?! You ever
seen anything like that? You ever heard of anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Me neither. And I watch ‘Animal Planet’ all
the fuckin’ time!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No reception out here.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Bill, I’ll run out to your car, call for
paramedics from there.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: That’s a long ways. Them worms are out
there.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’ll keep my mouth covered.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No. I’ll go. The three of you, you wait here.
Get these folks, out of the barn. The stench and rot can’t be any good
for ’em.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Be careful, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It’s got to be some Goddamn biological
weapons. Government’s testin’ ’em out on us! ’Cause who gives a shit if
Wheelsy disappears, right?!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I hope it ain’t contagious. I’ll be pissed
as hell I turn into a big mollusk. I’ll fuckin’ sue, I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Hey, sugarplum.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: Marriage. It’s a sacred bond. Just like you
said.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I’m sorry ‘bout trying to strangle you and
all. I lost – Lost my head. I didn’t want to do none of the things I
done. Not kill them pets. Not make Brenda a womb. But it’s my nature,
ain’t it? How can you blame a one for actin’ according to his
nature?</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: I wanted to tell you what was going on. But I
didn’t - didn’t think you’d love me no more. I never knew… love, Starla,
I –</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Wally?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Maybe you better sit back down. You don’t
look so good.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s dad</strong>: Kylie, honey, you okay? Come on
out.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s sister 2</strong>: Hi, Kylie. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Open the door, sweetie. I know we don’t
look so good, but your mommy and daddy love you.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Get away!!</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s mom</strong>: Now, Kylie, there’s no excuse why not
to be with your family. This is family fun day, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s sister 1</strong>: Kyyy-leee, this is your last cha-
ance.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s – ?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s dad</strong>: Well, hello there, Pardy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What happened to you, Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s dad</strong>: Poison ivy out back, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>kylie’s sisters</strong>: We’re itchy!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: They’re not my… They killed…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Okay. Y’all just wait in this spot. I’m gonna

<p><strong>rancher</strong>: Hey there, killer.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: Now, what’d I say?! Y’all just sit down!
You need to get some Goddamn rest! You’re sick!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Let go!!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: It burns!!</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: What’d you do to my fuckin’ hand?!</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Meat.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Let him go!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Trevor, come on.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What’d you do to her?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There you go, sugarplum! Why you choosing
camps ’fore you hear –</p>
<p><strong>jack redneck</strong>: Both sides of the story!? Both sides
of the story!?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Why are you talking like Grant?!</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: ’Cause I am Grant!</p>
<p><strong>wally redneck</strong>: I’m you husband – I’m you husband,
Goddammit –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You swore to honor and obey –</p>
<p><strong>older cop redneck</strong>: Obey me – Obey me, so put that
Goddamn</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Don’t come any closer. I’ll… shoot.</p>
<p><strong>wally</strong>: You ain’t gonna shoot me! You always needed
me to protect you! You for damn sure ain’t got the balls to –</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shit. Ammo’s in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Trevor! Margaret!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: They killed Margaret!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: We’re coming your way, man!</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Go! Go! Please!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My friends are still in the forest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We need their weight.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dumbshits.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>older cop</strong>: Starla!!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby, you there?</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Yo, Chief. How y’all doin’?</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: You dig that rat out of the hole?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Listen, you got any reports of… I don’t know
what you call ’em. They look like big slugs, only fast.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Slugs? No. ‘Less you talkin’ about that new
waitress down at Sloan’s! Ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby –</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Oh, shit! I hope she ain’t a police radio
aficionado. If so, I apolog -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these
things. If you see ’em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they’ll go
straight down it. All right?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Are you nodding?</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I can’t hear when you’re nodding.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll be there in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: The worms are in their brains.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Drivin’ ’em around…</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: She’s right. We saw one – one came out of
Wally’s head.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yeah. Sort of his eye, it came out there
–</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Kylie, how do you –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Kylie, how do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kylie, honey. Please.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A lot of bad things have happened to you
today, we know. But we need your help to find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: I was in the bath. It tried to go inside me
and I – for a minute I became it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The worm?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: I got it out.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Part of him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who? Who?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Mrs. Grant’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: But not always. I was – He was… other stuff
too.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What other stuff?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: He’s a fucking Martian?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: For real it looks like a needle. Its real
face. But it always gots another.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: He goes from place to place, worlds… planets…
killing ’em. He takes over half of what’s alive and eats the other half.
Till they’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: Now he’s here. He went in Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Through a wound on his stomach?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: He took him over. His body. His – his brain,
everything what he knew. He’s only been dumb stuff before -
amoeba-things, and rhino-things. He liked being human. Didn’t want to
change.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: And you said the worms are part of him.
They’re all linked, like one creature?</p>
<p><strong>kylie</strong>: When one sees you they all see you.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: An animal that doesn’t procreate. It
spreads, grows. A living disease.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So the way to stop this thing is to stop
Grant?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside
town. Come pick us up.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: I got to leave my post.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Starla.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Was always curious why you… married Grant in
the first place… Just never seemed outta love.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I know what people say, Bill. I… Remember,
back in high school I worked at my father’s gas station?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant used to get filled up every day. I
knew it was just to see me. He was too old – But he was handsome. And he
had that big ol’ Lincoln then. I flirted with him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, big ol’ Lincoln, sure. Guess I would
have flirted with him too.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: My father, he was – he was real close to
evil. People didn’t know. Still don’t. From the time I was a toddler
he’d beat the hell out of me. I don’t mean just like a smack for
smart-mouthing… he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven
or twelve, things… well, they got worse.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: When you wanted to run away, I called your
dad.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: That wasn’t a good night, no.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Anyway, Grant rolls in one day. I fill his
tank with like an eighth- a-gallon as usual. And he notices my lip’s all
swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened. I don’t know why I
chose then, why Grant – I guess I saw an opportunity. And I told him
everything, first time I told anyone. Grant was furious. He picked up a
tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half
to death. You say it’s not about love, Bill. But that was the closest
thing to it I ever knew.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant asked me to marry him a few weeks
later. I felt… safe with him.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: After all this shit tonight, I know for sure
now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Don’t worry, kid. Pretty soon, we’ll be in
town, everything’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: They musta hit a deer. Probably got out to
see if it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Bambi-rats!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: When I buy my zoo, I’m leaving them things
the hell out!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby!</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Hey there, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove
and McCammon right away!</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Don’t worry, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Already on our way.</p>
<p><strong>diseased townsfolk</strong>: Starrrrrlaaaaaa!!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What the hell are we going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just block the doors, any way you can.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Goddamn snakes!!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: This is stupid.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: We can’t make it. Just get away, when you
get the chance.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: He wants me, Bill! I’m going to get him to
take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, Starla! No!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>diseased woman diseased kid</strong>: Starlaaaaaaa!
Starlaaaa!</p>
<p><strong>smashed-face man</strong>: You said for better or worse! You
lied!</p>
<p><strong>no longer pretty brenda’s husband</strong>: I gave you
everything! I. Loved. You!</p>
<p><strong>shelby fat sick guy</strong>: It’s not just about lesson I
wanted you by my side, plans! Hank Wilcox wants sugarplum. But I’m too
your pussy! ugly now, huh!!?</p>
<p><strong>mr. inappropriate waitress</strong>: Your daddy’d still be
You always thought I was a fucking your every hole joke, ain’t you?
weren’t it for me!!</p>
<p><strong>brenda’s husband</strong>: You like Pardy better’n me? That’s
who you want to screw now?!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant… Please…</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I’m sorry… I know I haven’t behaved how you
– how you want. I know. Don’t… hurt… me.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: We need… to… talk.</p>
<p><strong>diseased man brenda’s husband</strong>: Then talk. Then
talk.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Not here, though, okay? Not all of you. I’m
not used to – I want to talk to your face, Grant. Your more real face.
Your –</p>
<p><strong>smashed-face man</strong>: Pardy?!! Where are you,
Pardy!!</p>
<p><strong>diseased woman shelby</strong>: Pardy. Pardy. Pardy. Come on
out, Pardy.</p>
<p><strong>pastor</strong>: We’ve surrounded the town, you prick! Ain’t
no way outta here!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant? We should talk.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Hey, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You did some real interesting decorating
here.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Look, the sun’s starting to come up.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t – I didn’t know you wanted
it dark.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You like these memories, huh, Grant?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You like being called Grant, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I think you do. You really do. You like
being Grant. Like when we danced. And when you… made love to me here on
the bed. Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: I know you’ve been alone, Grant. Almost
forever. From here to there to there to here, there’s never been another
one for you.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Grant. Grant, I could help you. Be with you
the way you want. See, I want to live. I’ve never had much use for this
world, not really. You and I, together, we –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You don’t trust me, I know. That’s why I
brought you someone, Grant.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: It’s Bill. He’s in the house next door. Just
look.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: See? I brought him here for you! As an
offering! To prove I love you more than him!</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Now, Bill!! Kill the motherfucker!!</p>
<p><strong>grant</strong>: Er…?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Starla, over here.</p>
<p><strong>healthy human beings</strong>: men and women and children –
going about their daily chores. Tears come to her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: We can probably get some first aid and food
at this gas station up here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah. Good.</p>
<p><strong>cashier</strong>: Comes to 32.87.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Shit. I- I forgot… I wanted to get
aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’ll just head up here into Bishopville, get
checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we’ll head off to Hollywood after
all, huh?</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Please, Starla. I’m gonna do my best not to
hurt anybody –</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: You took Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s my nature.</p>
<p><strong>starla</strong>: And this is mine.</p>
