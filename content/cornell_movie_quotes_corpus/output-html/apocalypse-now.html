<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … It’s crazy – sugar is up to 200 dollars a
ton – sugar !</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: What about oil ?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Food, oil –look, let me show you something.
This is the economy of the United States in two years –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is West Germany. This is Japan. This
is Italy. This is Iran. And this is Saudi Arabia… In two years ? Do you
understand ?</p>
<p><strong>accountant</strong>: What’s to prevent it ?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe nothing. But I’ll tell you, I didn’t
build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing
nothing. We can protect our interests. We are still the most powerful
nation in the world. Militarily.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know bodyguard; he was a captain in
Viet Nam. You talk to him, except he won’t talk. This kind of man can
kill you with his pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Carries a attache case at all times. You
know what’s in it ? An Ingram Machine pistol.</p>
<p><strong>charlie willard</strong>: I don’t tahe chances, and Bullshit.
You can kill neither should this country. with the ridge of your If
we’re strong, we should hand to the throat; you protect our interests,
and can crush a skull with we should have the respect your knee… but you
of the world, even if it can’t kill anybody with takes another war. your
pinky.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The attache case has been empty for three
years, but it makes him safe to think there’s a machine pistol in
it.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He likes to hear stories about Nam. I tell
him I can’t; they’re not cleared. The truth is he wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: There’s no way I can tell them… what really
happened over there.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: There was only one part that mattered – for
me, anyway. I don’t even know if I remember all of it. I can’t remember
how it ended, exactly – because when it ended I was insane.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: But I know how it started for me – I was on
R. and R. in Saigon; my first time south of the DMZ in three months. I
wasn’t sure, but I thought this guy was following me.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: How about a drink ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sure, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Winning the war by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Part.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Which part is that ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: My part.</p>
<p>****: Beer, with ice and water.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s good gin.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m sure it is, but I had hepatitis.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Delta ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: North ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah. Way north.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What unit were you with ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Rangers, eh?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Were you Longe Range Recon –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No – I worked too far north for</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: That’s quite an array of ribbons…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Let’s talk about you.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I was an FO for the 25th.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Tracks ?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Fat. That’s real fat.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: At least you always have enough water. How
many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Thirty – sometimes fifty.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You know, I can remember once, getting back
below the DMZ – and the first Americans we ran into were a track
squadron. I just couldn’t believe how much water they had. We’d been
chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks,
we’d been drinking anything – rain water, river shit, stuff right out of
the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling
water all over. I could’ve killed them. I swear to God I would have,
too, if …</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I didn’t know we had units up there in
North Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: How long were you up there ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: A long time.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: A year ? Waiter another beer.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me
all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there
you’re not going to find out anymore about me.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What do you want ?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: If you’re B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group,
we’d like you to come with us.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Whose orders ?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Headquarters 11 Corps – 405th A.S.A
Battalion – S-2 – Com-Sec – Intelligence – Nha Trang.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who are you ?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: The agency.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: They took me to some place outside Nha
Trang… Intelligence Headquarters for all operations in South East Asia.
I’d worked for Intelligence before –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
reporting as ordered, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Okay, Willard, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Have you ever seen this officer before,
Captain Willard ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: This gentleman or myself ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I believe on your last job you executed a
tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I am not presently disposed to discuss
that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You know much about about Special Forces;
Green Berets, Captain ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’ve worked with them on occasions and I
saw the movie , sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Then you can appreciate Command’s concern
over their – shall we say ‘erratic’ methods of operation. I have never
favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever.
Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn’t
give him any priviliges in my book – not in this man’s army.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: We didn’t need ’em in Korea – no sir, give me
an Ohio farm boy and an M-1 Garand, none of this fancy crap – no
sir.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Major.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: We have Special Forces A detachments all
along the Cambodian border. Two here and another one here – twelve or
fourteen Americans – pretty much on their own; they train and motivate
Montagnard natives; pick their own operations. If they need something,
they call for it, and get it within reason. What we’re concerned with is
here.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba. It was
originally a larger base, built up along the river in an old Cambodian
fortress.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: … Captain, we know something’s going on up
there – Major –</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Communications naturally dwindled with the
lack of V.C. activity, this is routine, expected … but six months ago
communication virtually stopped.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: About the same time – large numbers of
Montagnards of the M’Nong descent began leaving the area – this in
itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade
Tribe that lived in the area for centuries. But what is unusual is that
we began to find Rhade refugees too – in the same sampans as the
M’Nongs. These people aren’t afraid of V.C. They’ve put up with war for
twenty years – but something is driving them out.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: We communicate with the base infrequently.
What they call for are air strikes, immediate – always at night. And we
don’t know what or who the air strikes are called on.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who ?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: You see, no one has really gone into this
area and come back alive.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Why me ?</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel, Special
Forces. We understand you knew him.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: He’s commanding the detachment at Nu Mung
Ba.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Up 2 – 0 – give it to me quick – Mark flare –
affirmative damn – Immediate receive – hearing automatic weapons fire
man …</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: Blue Delta five This Big Rhine – three
Need that ordinance immediately Goddamn give it to me immediate Christ –
Big Rhino – Blue God – Delta damn – goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>third voice</strong>: This is Big Rhino six – Blue Delta.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: That’s Colonel Kurtz.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I want that napalm dropped in the trees –
spread it among the branches.</p>
<p>****: We’d also like some white phosporous, Blue Delta. White
phosporous, give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I only met Kurtz once.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Would he remember you ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What was your impression of him ?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: You didn’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Anyone got a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I thought he was a lame.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: A lame ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: This is years ago, before he joined Special
Forces, I guess. We had an argument.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: About what ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I don’t know. He was a lame, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: But why ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He couldn’t get through a sentence without
all these big words; about why we kill.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Well, he’s killing now.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: What does that mean ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Maybe it’s not Kurtz. I don’t believe he’s
capable of that. I just don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: It’s got to be Kurtz.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: The point is that Kurtz or somebody
attacked a South Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three days ago. Last week a
Recon helicopter was lost in the area – another took heavy damage –
direct fire from their base camp.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Our Recon flight ?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Ours.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Touchy.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: You can see, of course, the implications,
if any of this – even rumours leaked out.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You want me to clean it up – simple and
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Exactly – you’ll go up the Nung River in a
Navy P.B.R. – appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your
acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what’s happened – and why. Then
terminate his command.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Terminate ?</p>
<p><strong>civilian</strong>: Terminate with extreme prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty
much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief – Gunner’s Mate Third
Class L. Johnson – Lance Johnson; Gunner’s Mate Third Class J. Hicks –
The Chef – Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him
Mr. Clean.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chief, try to keep out of where we’re going
– Why we’re goin’ and what’s gonna be the big surprise.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: All right with me, I used to drive a
taxi.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The Delta closes off to us about ten miles
out of Hau Fat. We’ll be able to pick up some supplies – bit I think
there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung
River. It’s all Charlie’s turf from there on out.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We’re gonna have some help to get in the
river. You know these waters, Chief ?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: ’Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo
Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I
brought his body back down.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Shot himself. What for ?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Beats me – the sun was too much for him, or
the mud. Who knows ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Arch light.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I hate that – Every time I hear that noise
something terrible happens.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Anybody see some smoke ?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Too far inland.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: There they are.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Charlie don’t ever hear ’em. Not till it’s
too late – don’t have to hit you neither, concussion’ll do it for a
quarter mile or better. Burst your ears – suck the air outta your
lungs.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The dossier on A detachment had letters
from Kurtz’ wife and the wives and families of his men. All asking where
to send future mail, understanding the necessery silence due to the
nature of their work – None of the men had written home in half a
year.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a dedicated and
well-disciplined spirit. He is a fine officer, combining military
efficiency – with a broad background in the Humanities, the Arts and
Sciences …</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … He views his military career as the
dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to
those darker, less fortunate areas in the world.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … I feel Captain Kurtz’ request for Special
Forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian
concerns, and his somewhat liberal politics, though I can see no reason
to deny it.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … We feel Major Kurtz’ need to bring a
sense of Western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be
of use in accordance with our ‘Vietnamization’ programs …</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: One day later we came to an advanced
staging area along the coast. This was our last chance to pick up
supplies before approaching the mouth of the Nung River.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Lance – I want you to go with the Captain an’
get three extra drums of fuel and maybe scrounge some more 50
caliber.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah – look at those uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Poor bastards, have a long year to go.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I don’t know anything about these papers,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: They’re in order – it’s perfectly clean –
just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Well, you know I don’t have the priority
to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who’s your
commanding officer ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Right now – I am.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Well who the hell verifies that ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: No shit – what’s all the activity for around
here ?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: The show –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What show ?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Big show in the parade grounds this noon –
some boss stuff –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: This – Bob Hope or the like –</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: No sir, I think – this’ll be a little bit
different –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Where’s it gonna be ?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: It’s really too much – I mean I’ve collected
every picture of her since she was Miss December.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Yeah – you can really get hung up on them
like the cat in the Delta.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What cat ?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: One that went up for murder – he was an Army
Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I never heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Yeah – he really dug his Playboy mag, man – I
mean like he was there when it arrived – He just knew.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: So what happened ?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a
them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants – anyhow, the Lieutenant took
his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn’t give
it back.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Yeah – typical A.R.V.N.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Then went too far – he sat there and starts
mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an’ all that. Sergeant
says, don’t do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off
that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese – Sergeant says,
don’t do that again. You’ll wish you hadn’t. Then he stood up, flicked
his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through
the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock – Hell, just the
magazine was floatin’ there all full of holes.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: They nail him for it bad ?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: He’s in the L.B.J. – didn’t give him no
medals or nothing –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I’d like to say hello from all of us up here,
to all of you out there. All of you who’ve worked so hard during
Operation Brute Force – Paratroopers – Infantry – Airmen – Medics –
Marines – and Sailors. And I want you to know that we feel proud of you
and know how hard your job is. To prove it – we’ve brought some
entertainment we think you’re gonna like: The Playmate of the Year and
her two runners up !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing
but us and the coastline. I felt like I had set off for the center of
the earth…</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Smoke !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Where ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Black smoke … secondary burning.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Yeah – fishing village – helicopters over
there. Hueys, lots of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: First Air Cavalry. They’re the ones gonna
get us into the River.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about
a hundred yards – give me some room to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Bring me some cards.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir ?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Body cards, you damn fool – cards !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Captain B-L. Willard, sir – 4th Recon Group
– I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp – I believe
you understand the nature of my mission.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Yeah – Na Trang told me to expect you –
we’ll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Six a spades – eight a hearts – Isn’t one
worth a Jack in this whole place.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What ? Here. You sure?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What’s your name, sailor ?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Gunner’s Mate, Third Class – L. Johnson,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Lance Johnson? The surfer?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: That’s right, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: It’s an honor to meet you Lance. I’ve
admired your nose-riding for years – I like your cutback, too. I think
you have the best cutback there is.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You can cut out the sir, Lance – I’m Bill
kilgore – I’m a goofy foot.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: This is Mike from San Diego and Johnny from
Malibu – they’re good solid surfers – none of us are anywhere near your
class, though.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: My orders are from Com-Sec Intel – B.L.
Willard, 4th Recon –</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Just hold up a second, Captain – I’ll get
to you soon enough – We’ve got things to do here.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: … we do a lot of surfing around here. Like
to finish up operations early and fly down to Vung Tau for the evening
glass. Have you ever surfed the point at Vung Tau? I liked the beach
breaks around Na Trang a lot – good lefts.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: … we keep three boards in my Command Huey
at all times. You never can tell when you’re gonna run into something
good. I got a guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict a swell two days in
advance. We try to work it in.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Hell, that’s an Ace if I ever saw one.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Where’ve you been riding, Lance?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I haven’t surfed since I got here.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: That’s terrible – we’ll change that – I’d
like to see you work – I’ve always liked your cutback; got a hell of a
left turn, too.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba
for?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I got bored in Saigon.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What’s the furthest you been in?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Haiphong.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No. Walked.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What’d you do for supplies?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Mercenaries – agents, traitors – they put
out caches.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Can you trust them?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No. They put out two or three for every one
I needed. When you get to the one you’ll use, you just stake it out. If
something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to
pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz
commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: When did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: ’Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who knows.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard
some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man –
remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General
of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew
Kurtz?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I met him.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He musta changed ! I got to get into the
Nung River, here or here.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: That village you’re pointing at is kinda
hairy.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Hairy ?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I mean it’s hairy – they got some pretty
heavy ordnance, boy – I’ve lost a few recon ships in there now and
again.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers
here.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: And I don’t intend to get some of them
chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung
River. You say you don’t know Kurtz?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I met him.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You talk like him. I don’t mind taking
casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit
– ten Cong to one.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’ll find enough Cong up there.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What about this point here?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What’s the name of that goddamn village –
Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook names all sound the same.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Mike, you know anything about the point at
Vin Drip Drop?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Boss left.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s really long left slide, breaks on the
short side of the point – catches a south swell.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you tell me about that
place – a good left. There aren’t any good left slides in this whole,
shitty country. It’s all goddamn beach break.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s hairy ,though. That’s where we lost
McDonnel – they shot the hell out of us. It’s Charlie’s point.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: How big it is?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Six to eight feet.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: A six-foot left.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Boss. What’s the wind like.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Light off shore – really hollow.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We could go in tomorrow at dawn – there’s
always off-shore wind in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: The draft of that river might be too shallow
on the point.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Hell, we’ll pick your boat up and lay it
down like a baby, right where you want it. This is the Cav boy –
airmobile. I can take that point and hold it as long as I like – and you
can get anywhere you want up that river that suits you, Captain. Hell, a
six foot left. You take a gunship back to division – Mike, take Lance
with you – let him pick out a board, and bring me my Yater Spoon – the
eight six.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t know, sir – it’s – it’s –</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I mean it’s hairy in there – it’s
Charlie’s point.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Charlie don’t surf.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: How do you feel, boy?</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Like a mean motherfucker, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: We’ll come in low out of the rising sun –
We’ll put on the music about a mile out.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Music?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Yeah. Classical stuff – scares the hell out
of the slopes – the boys love it.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust – turn on
coordinates 1-0 – niner, assume attack formation.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Eagle Thrust formation target 2800 yards –
begin psch-war operations.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: 700 – 600 yards – 500 – Commence firing.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: 700 yards – 600 – 500 – commence firing.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: We’re down, Eagle Thrust – we’re hit. We
got a hot L.Z. here.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate air
strike on the tree line, Eagle Thrust.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Big Duke Six to Hell’s Angels Four – bring
it in on along tree line and huts.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Hell’s Angels Four to Big Duke Six – we’ll
need green smoke – suggest you have the FAC mark it.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Haven’t got time, Hell’s Angels – lay it
right up the tree line.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Fucking savages.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The enemy. Who else?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Very good, Hell’s Angels – suggest you
follow with cannon fire.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: This is Baker Delta Four – Captain hit bad –
need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about
thirty yards to our left.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four – hold –
we’re right over you.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Right along the doors, boy.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Fine… fine… little higher. Through the
roof; yeah, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Didn’t anybody bring me any bombs,
grenades, claymores or anything?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: You didn’t tell me to, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You shoulda known.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Sonuvabitch – anybody hurt?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Automatic weapons flashes along those trees
– probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47’s.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The trees, eh…</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Eagle Thrust Four – Big Duke Six. Join me
in sparaying some trees.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Affirmative, Big Duke Six – We’re even got
some rockets left.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Take her in low, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Hold it, boy.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Rifle.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: My rifle, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: That’s 27, sir.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Anyone got a card?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The L.Z.’s cooling off fast – we’ll move in
another company an’ then we’ll own it. Charlie’s point.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Good swell.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I said it’s a good swell – hell of a good
swell ’bout six feet. Let’s get a look at it.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Incoming !</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: This L.Z. is still pretty hot, sir, maybe we
oughta stand somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m waiting for the fucking boat,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: It’ll get here, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Change.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Wh – what?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Change – get out there – I want’a see if
it’s ridable – change.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s still pretty hairy, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You want’a surf, soldier?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: That’s good, boy, because it’s either surf
or fight.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I’m gonna cover for ’em – that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You think that section on the point is
ridable, Lance?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I think we ought to wait for the tide to come
in.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Doesn’t happen for six hours.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The tide – doesn’t come in for six
hours.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: They far enough?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Sure – fine –</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: That’s far enough – pick one up and come on
in –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Maybe he’ll get tubed.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Maybe he’ll get inside the tube – where –
where they can’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Incoming !</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Just something I read in the Free Press.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: They just missed a good set – the chicken
shits !</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Try it again, you little bastards.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I�m not afraid to surf this place. I’ll
surf this place.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Bring that R.T., soldier.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Big Duke Six to Hell’s Angels – Goddamit, I
want that treeline bombed – yeah – napalm – gimme some napalm – son of a
bitch – yeah, I’ll take H.Z. or C.B.U.’s if you got any of them – just
bomb ’em into the Stone Age, boy.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: We’ll have this place cleaned up and ready
for us in a jiffy, boy. Don’t you worry.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Forget that extra drum – it’s too damn
hot.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Clear on starboard – Where’s Lance an’ the
Captain?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I saw that Colonel’s Huey on the point –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Let’s just get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Look. There it is; the boat.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: He’ll kill us.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He can’t kill us. We’re on his side.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: You smell that. You smell that?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Napalm, boy – nothing else in the world
smells like that –</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I love the smell of napalm in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You know, some day this war’s gonna
end..</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Yes, I know.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The wind –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Feel it – it’s the wind – it’s blowing on
shore – It’s on shore !</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: It’s gonna blow this place out. It’s gonna
ruin it …</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The kid can’t ride sloppy waves.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The kid can’t stand sloppy waves.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You don’t expect this kid to ride that
crap, do you? He’s a goddamn artist, he needs something to work
with…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah, I’m an artist, goddamit !</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: Yeah – yeah, I can understand how you
feel.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: It’s the napalm – it’s causing the wind –
ruining my perfect left.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: The napalm – ruin – napalm my perfect left
– my perfect left point break – napalm –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Are you finished surfing?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Then let’s get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: No – no, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Which one’s the Colonel’s?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: The Yater – the clear one with the thin
stringer.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Incoming ! Incoming – son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: This one , Lance?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah, Jesus Christ !</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: What’d you that for?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: When I was a kid I, never had a Yater
spoon.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Maybe we better stay in under the trees till
dark – we got his Yater.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He didn’t look like he’d take that sitting
down.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Let’s put some distance between us and
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Lance —</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Why don’t you roll us a big joint? I think
the Captain’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Take one a mine –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: You hear it again?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No – I don’t think so. But it’ll be back.
They were circling. It’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: You think he’d of shot us?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Any time – us – Americans.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I don’t think he�d of shot us on the beach
but – he’d of shot us if he saw me taking the board –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: A Yater spoon is hard to get – especially
here.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He’s a man who knows what he wants – he
does know what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Can I go get those mangos now?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I’ll go with you in a while – judt hold tight
awhile –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Captain – that was all true about the rats
and chocolate and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: And you could just tell when the supplies
were booby trapped?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: It’s a feeling you get in the jungle. When
you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are,
but their morale, how far they’re going, whether they’re near their
camp, the weapons they’re carrying.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: How can you tell their weapons.. an’ how far
they’re going?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Mostly from the imprints when they put them
down to rest. their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the
joints that may be lying around. If they’re near a base camp, they
wouldn’t be conserving food; they’ll be throwing it away half-eaten. If
the branches aren’t broken, their weapons are slung. But all this is
just technique.. There’s a feeling you get after a while, that’s what’s
important. I was going through a village once. I was looking for a
certain party. I took off my boots, and walked into each hut. It was
midnight. I went into three like that and suddenly I realized I�d gone
into each hut the same way – standing up – so the next one I went in on
my belly. An RPD burst took out the door a bit above my head. Things
like that.</p>
<p><strong>kilgore</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt or harm you, boy – I
just want the board back – You can understand – It was one of my best –
You know how hard it is to get a board you like, boy. I’m not gonna hurt
or harm you – Just leave it where I can find it –</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Jesus – that guy’s too damn much.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I wonder if that was the same copter.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He’s probably got ’em all over the river
with that recording. We better move now while it’s dark.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Yeah, Chef – go ahead – take Lance with you
–</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’ll go with him –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I wanta get my feet on solid land once in
awhile –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chef.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Yes, sir –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Why they call you that?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Call me what, sir?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chef – is that ‘cause you like mangoes an’
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: No, sir – I’m a real chef, sir – I’m a
sauciere –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: A sauciere –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: That’s right, sir – I come from New Orleans –
I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in
sauces; my whole family. It’s what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris
and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called
me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What are you doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Cook school – that did it.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: They lined us all up in front of a hundred
yards of prime rib – magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they
started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it – boiling. I
looked in, an’ it was turning gray. I couldn’t stand it. I went into
radio school.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: – quiet –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: There…</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: It’s a motherfucking tiger – goddamn…</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Goddamn – Jesus Christ tiger – motherfucking
tiger – ohhhhhhhhh –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Ohhhh – tiger ! Oh goddamn ! It’s a tiger !
Jesus Christ ! Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What’s this tiger shit?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No shit… I think I shot the hell out of
him.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I wasn�t looking.. I was running.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Was a big tiger – no shit?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who stopped to measure him – let’s get the
hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: A motherfucking tiger – I could’ve been
killed.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You forgot the mangoes, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods
– I could’ve been eaten alive. I’m never going into that jungle again. I
gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He was right, the Chef – never go into the
jungle, unless you’re ready to go all the way.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What was in the jungle? What was there,
waiting for me?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … Kurtz was in there. Or was he; was it
Kurtz? He was just a name to me now; I couldn’t remember a face, a voice
– he just didn’t add up to me. all his liberal bullshit about the end of
savagery – and the role of our culture, our way of life…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Our way of life – I really started to look
forward to meeting Kurtz again.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: – must remember that we owe our thanks for
these to the wonderful services of the U.S.O. – here’s another oldie –
this one dedicated…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: … to the fire team at An Khe from their
groovy C.O. Fred the Head –</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: The Rolling Stones and “Satisfaction…”</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Outa sight.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The dossier of A Dtachment contained
letters from the families and wives of Kurtz’ men There were letters
from Kurtz’ wife as well.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Dearest Walt – I have to confess something.
I know how you feel about this, but I had to ask Bob to find out what he
could – I just couldn’t stand it anymore, not knowing where you are,
whether you’re alive or dead. I’m sorry Walt, I’m sorry I said that. Bob
didn’t tell me anything – he said he couldn’t – I can’t stand it
anymore, Walt – I just can’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I have to take the kids to school every
morning now – carpools just never work out.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Soldier – where’�s your C.O.?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Stepped on a booby trap, sir – got blown
all to hell –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Well , who’s in command here?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I don’t know – don’t have any idea – I’m
just the night man –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What about you, soldier?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Captain –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Over here, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You came in on that boat, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Where are you headed?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What’s it matter? Get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Look – you know the girls – Thta’s Terri –
she was playmate of –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Oh – I see – Well, girls, this is Captain –
eh –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Captain Willard – go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Look – we got in a little trouble – they
rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this – uh Operation Brute
Force – They just brought it back this morning.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well I mean like they also took our fuel –
We’ve been here two days.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Dreadful.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Look – the girls could get killed – we’re not
supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: We could use some fuel – just a half drum –
just enough to get us out a here.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We need all our fuel.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: But, Captain, think what these girls have
done for the boys – think of how they’ve risked –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Captain –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: It’s really rough here – Captain – we’re just
not built for it –</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: That’s rich –</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Do us a favor – I’d do one for you – if I
could –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Look – you know who that is, Captain – you
know what she’s saying – you’ll never see stuff that good outside of a
magazine for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m not that fond of blondes – maybe I like
brunettes –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Take your pick – they all like you – I can
tell –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I like all of them –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Good – like I said, take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I said I like all of them.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Now just a second – I’m doing you a favor,
buddy – what’re you trying to pull?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We need all our fuel anyway.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Wait – wait – don’t get up tight – what I
meant was we’d need a whole drum for that –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sit down – we’ll talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: What’s there to talk about – this whole thing
disgusts me.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: My men –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: What !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: That’s what there is to talk about – my man
– I take a good care of my men –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You’re out of your skull –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We have a lot of pride in our unit –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: How far do you think you can push – what kind
of people do you think –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Esprit de corps –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: No – absolutely not –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: One for all – all for one –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You can keep your fucking fuel –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You make some of your closest friends in
the army – war has a way of bringing men together.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Get out –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Men of all races – nationalities –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Two drums –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Two whole drums –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too
–</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about – Get
fucked –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I will – I assure you that – You got a
fifty on that H-34 – leave the ammo in boxes – I’ll get my men to bring
the first drum with ’em –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Have the girls freshen up a bit – comb
their hair – put on something – you know what I mean –</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: You keep this thing in this condition an’
it’s gonna jam, Lance – mark my words.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Why don’t you go pet the water buffaloes –
get off my back.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Careful, Captain, they’ve been known to
charge.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: All right I got a little surprise for you
–</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’ve arranged with those people we saw at
Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel
–</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chef – since you’re such a fan of Miss
December’s I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take
the first drum up there.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I don’t believe you –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What’re you trying to say, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’ll see soon enough – get going, sailor
–</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: No shit – hot damn –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I’ve got every one of your pictures – I’ve got
the centerfold – the Playmate’s review – the Playmate of the Year
run-off – everything, even the calender –</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Well, get undressed and let’s get it over
with –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I can’t believe it – I’d a never even got to
see you if it wasn’t for this war –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: You wouldn’t mind – uh kinda draping that
jacket over you sort of the way you were in the calender, would you?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Come on – cut this crap – I gotta get back to
Saigon –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Just let me look awhile – I just don’t believe
–</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Well – uh thanks – see you around.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cathy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: I’m next –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Ma’am – I’d like to thank you for what you
an’ all your friends have done for us – I want you to know that me an’
the men appreciate you coming all this way – riskin’ your lives – living
uncomfortably an’ doing all you can to entertain us. I want you to know
personally, Miss, that for the past few minutes you have made me feel at
home.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Just wanted to say that, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Two days and nights later, we approach the
Do Lung Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I gotta get out a here – I�ll pay – I got
money.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Get away from this boat.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who’s your C.O., soldier?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Fuck you, you’ll get what’s coming to
you.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Captain Willard?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Captain Willard – we got these from Nha
Thrang two days ago – they expected you here then –</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: You don’t know how happy that makes me,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now I can get out a here – if I can find
a way out.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We’ll be needing some supplies and fuel –
do you know anybody who can give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: I’d just clear out as soon as I could if
I were you, sir. They’re gonna start working on the bridge with torches
again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What is this bridge?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: It’s of strategic importance for keeping
the highway into Bat Shan open – the generals don’t like to admit that
Bat Shan is surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Every night we build it and by 0800
they’ve blown it up – it and a lot of good men – But the generals like
to say the road is open – ha ! Nobody uses that road except Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: This is the cesspool of hell.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Incoming.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: All right – Lance, go with the Captain an’
see what you can scrounge –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Better make it fast, sir – we don’t really
need much anyway.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Straight ahead, son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You came right to it, son of a bitch –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Son of a bitch, sir.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Where’s your chief supply officer?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Beverly Hills –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Straight up the road – a concrete bunker –
Beverly Hills – where else you think he’d be?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: C’mon –</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Get your asses down, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Watch your feet, asshole –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You stepped on my face.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: We thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The whole world loves a smart ass.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What’re you shooting at, soldier?</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Gooks.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: I�m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: It’s all right, sergeant – what’s out
there?</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: They were tryin’ to cut through the wire – I
got ’em all I think.</p>
<p><strong>other soldier</strong>: Oh yeah – listen.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: He’s trying to call his friends – send up a
flare.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Those are all dead, stupid, he’s obviously
underneath ’em –</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Wake up the Roach.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Yeah, man.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Slope in the wire – hear him.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Bust him.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: Hear him?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Sure , yeah.</p>
<p><strong>gunner</strong>: You need a flare –</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: No, it�s cool.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: He’s close – real close.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Muhhh Fuhhh …</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Geez, I wish they’d hurry.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Yeah, it still runs.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Do me a favor buddy, please.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Send these out when you get back to the
world.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It’s to everyone I really knew – the first
girl I screwed – my brother – best friend – I wanted to tell ’em how
much I enjoyed knowing ’em – it’s been a great twenty years. I gotta let
’em know.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: What’re you askin’ me for – put ’em in the
first helicopter comes in tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Nobody comes in here.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: The N.V.A. 312th – over there the 307th –
on that hill we counted fourteen different guns in one minute – they got
rockets mortars, snipers in those trees, there’s a million of those
shitty little bastards out there – we’re all gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: I’m gonna be dead.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You got a chance in that boat – by morning
you could be five miles down the river.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: We ain’t goin’ down the river.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: What’s up river from here anyhow –</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Spooky.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: No, it’d be spooky without the war – give
’em back.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We found some bodies – let’s get out a
here.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I can’t see a fucking thing.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We hit a big enough one this hull will
shatter like a Corvette. Fucking plastic boat.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What about ducking into one of those
tributaries till this river slows down?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Who knows what’s up there?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Can’t be any worse than this. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I think this river wants to take us home
fast. I’m practically goin’ in reverse.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Well, get in there.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: This whole area is lousy with V.C. – We don’t
stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we’ll be in Hau Fat in six
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Get in there !</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I’m
the responsible party.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Get in there now or I’ll bury you in this
river.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You’re fucking crazy. You’re going to get us
all killed.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: It breaks through in about twenty feet.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Keep cutting.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the
goddamn jungle’s watching us.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Probably is.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Whatdoya think it thinks.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: That we’re dumber than we look.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Lance – ’bout twenty meters starboard.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: There in the trees !</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw
another.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking
flash.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: I’m ripping ’em, man, son-of-a- bitch, it’s
jammed, oh God, it’s jammed.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Throw me that ordnance.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Give me some kind a field a fire –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: We’re through.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Oh, God –</p>
<p>****: I ain’t finished ! I ain’t finished !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Bring that bow ordnance into those
trees.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: There’s some bad holes, man, and the cracks –
water’s coming through the cracks. Food’s shot to hell.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: How much is left?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Less than half – sure is a mess down
there.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: And the grass?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang.
But we’re running low on the other.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: That’s a light down there –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What the hell is it?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: In the middle of the jungle – a goddamn
light.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Watch it !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: They’re not Cong.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We’re Americans.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t say we’re Americans?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chef, try your French.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Nous sommes Americains –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: French Nationals – they may not be too
friendly, though.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Nous sommes Americains – nous sommes des amis
–</p>
<p><strong>frenchman</strong>: Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
espanole.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I thought it was pretty good, myself.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.</p>
<p><strong>frenchman</strong>: Laisser tomber vos armes –</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Put the guns straight up – stand away from the
mounts.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>frenchman</strong>: Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement
–</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Take her in slow.</p>
<p><strong>philippe</strong>: Hands on the heads.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I can’t steer with my goddamn feet.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Hey, they speak American.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Who is the commanding officer?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I am – I’m Captain B.L. Willard. This is
Chief Warrant Officer Phillips – it’s his boat. We were shot up bad
downriver and need repairs and food – we can pay you in gold.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Philippe –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I’ll help you with –</p>
<p><strong>philippe</strong>: Do not move –</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Fifty calibers, eh, Captain –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: As I said, we can pay you in gold.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Entirely unnecessary, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We share a common enemy – you are our
guests. I am Gaston de marais – this is my family’s plantation. It has
been such for 121 years. It will be such after I die. This is my son,
Philippe – he has fought in Algeria and held the rank of Captain. And
Henry LeFevre – a sergeant; he was at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
servant, Tran Van Kac —</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: My youngest son – Christian –</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Christian’s wife – Ann-Marie –</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: And my youngest daughter – Claudine.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: American weapons?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We took them from the dead. Now – I assume
you want to rest, to shower. We’ll attend to your repairs after
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Shower.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We don’t want to bother you any, we –</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: A man of war is never bothered to aid an
ally – you will follow me, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: A habit of men of war, sir – you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Of course, Captain – an unfortunate
necessity.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What about the boat?</p>
<p><strong>philippe</strong>: My men will keep it for you –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Yeah – well, I’ll stay with the boat.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Chief. Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: A suitable accomodation for your men,
captain – you will, of course, be quartered with us –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Go ahead –</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Captain, this way.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Magnificent, eh, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: It is very good – there is no current – It
is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in
Paris when it arrived – do you know what might have caused –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Looks like a two thousand pound to me.
Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No, I’ve seen those in Normandy. This is
much better. My country – my country could never originate this.
Magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: A hot shower, hot damn.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I wondered – how long has this room been
like this; how long has the furniture been standing in these places?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Was it like this sixty years ago? Eighty
years? But here, even eighty years is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: It was jungle, once; and it will be jungle,
again…</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: This food is wonderful ! I can’t believe the
chef is a slope. Some more?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Hey – Lance.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya .. wouldya pass me the
Rice-a-roni, please.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Roxanne, I hope you are feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Je vais bien maintenant.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: May I present Captain Willard? He is of a
paratroop regiment. You know the difference between a paratrooper and a
regular soldier, don’t you , my dear?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Yes, they come from the sky.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I would like to know more about the .. uh,
plaque…</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. This is
only for this war, Captain. Viet Cong – 54; North Vietnamese regular
forces – 15; South Vietnamese – 28 – regular forces and otherwise.
Americain – 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Of course. I – Once we make our repairs, we
could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’ll get blown outta here some day.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We will never ‘evacuate’, Captain – this is
our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one
years, there is something to say for that.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The Vietnamese think it’s theirs – I guess
the Americans do, too.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: But we civilized it. A place belongs to
those who bring light to it, don’t you agree.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I always thought the French came here to
get the rubber.</p>
<p><strong>philippe</strong>: Excuse me, I must attend to my men.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: May I ask where the Captain is going in his
little boat?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We were going upriver when we got caught in
a storm, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing
there, only jungle.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Do you know that jungle?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: When I was a boy, my father would take me
there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no
white man.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What about an American named Kurtz?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We have never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Bon nuit, Roxanne – bon nuit, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You must realize, Captain – we have lost
much here – I, my husband. Gaston – his wife and son.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Cognac?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I should be checking on the boat.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: The war will still be here tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you
someone there?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Then you are like us.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What will you do after the war?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I just follow my footsteps, one at a time,
trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big
ones.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What’s a big question?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Kurtz. I know you’ve heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: That strange things.. terrible things have
occured around this American, Kurtz.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject
not to be spoken of, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Did you know – deeper in the jungle,
upriver – there are savages?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: But Captain, I mean – cannibals.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: What a pity, you don’t drink. Since my
husband died, there are so many things I must do alone.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Are you warm, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: The river is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I spend hours watching that river from my
bedroom window. It fascinates me.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I have been lonely here, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: I will fix you breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m afraid I won’t have time – I gotta
–</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Whe you reach the boat you will find that
half your fifty calibre stores – a case of grenades, a mortar and two
M-16’s and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: So that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: You may think what you wish, Captain, but I
like you very much.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What if I say no.</p>
<p><strong>roxanne</strong>: Then Philippe will have to kill all of
you.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Two of my men deserted last night. It
happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: They taking half our ammo, Captain – said it
was your orders.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: That’s right – I did.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I guess this is whAt men of war do –
eh?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: We endure, captain – you can blow up the
house and we will live in the cellar – destroy that and we’ll dig a hole
in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we’ll hide in the
swamp. all the while, we do but one thing – clean the blood off our
bayonets. Au revoir, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Next time we get in a good fire fight – I’d
like to know how she was, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>clean</strong>: What did you put in all those ammo boxes?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Rocks, sand – those two men who
deserted.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: When’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: While you were sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We moved deeper and deeper into the jungle.
It was very quiet there. It was like wandering on a prehistoric planet,
an unknown world … where the men thought they crawled to, I don’t know.
For me, we crawled toward Kurtz – exclusively.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Flood.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: No – most of ’em are still standing –
might’ve been disease.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I don’t know – there’d still be some sign –
it’s just like the one this morning.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: – All right, Lance –</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: The other one –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No – leave it –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Why – Charlie put it there to kill –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Thta’s not Charlie’s work –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Whoever put’em there didn’t do it to kill
people – They put ’em up as signs –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Signs?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah – like keep out –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do
Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz’ base.
Everything was still, the trees, the creepers, even the brush seemed
like it had been changed into some kind of stone. It was unnatural, like
a trance. Not a sound could be heard. I began to think I was deaf – then
the fog came suddenly, and I was blind too.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: They’re on the banks of the river.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Jesus !</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: No, Lance. Not while you can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Will they attack?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: If they have boats … or canoes… they’d get
lost in the fog. We can’t move either – we’ll end up on the shore.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: God…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Sounds like hundreds of them.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Shhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: It doesn’t sound hostile – it sounds like
they’ve seen us coming and it sounds like – I don’t know, a funeral. I
don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved
slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz’s
camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the
river.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Which way? Right or left?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who knows? Right.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Looks pretty shallow.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Upon reaching objective. Target key
personnel and commence operation. Should difficulty arise from which
extraction is impossible, break radio silence Com-Sec Command code
Strong Arm – indicate purgative air strike – code – Street Gang.
Purgative air strike ! Purgative ! They’d kill me too !</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They’re shooting
fucking arrows at us.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Steer her right.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Keep going.. keep going. They’re just
fucking sticks ! Chief, stay at the helm.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: A spear?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Stop it. Stop it !</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Chief’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: It was the strangest thing – I don’t know
that I can explain it. Two of my men dead, and all I could think of was
whether Kurtz was dead too. That’s all I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
Kurtz.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Somehow, in the middle of this … carnival,
Kurtz had grown into something – a gifted officer; a great man. Somehow,
he was the only light in this hopeless, hopeless darkness. And now I was
too late – he was probably gone, disappeared… by a grenade rolled into
his tent – or by some spear on the head. Christ, I felt like howling
like those animals in the fog.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Here they are in Los Angeles. Everything is
safe. There’s a supermarket around the corner, the police station around
the other. It would seem ridiculous to them that I was shot to hell
because I had lost the privilege of listening to the mysterious Colonel
Kurtz. Of course I was wrong. He was waiting for me. Kurtz was alive and
he was waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Just stand here with me where they can see
us. Do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We’ve been attacked.</p>
<p><strong>australian</strong>: I know, I know, it’s all right. Come in
this way. It’s mined over there. This way. It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: God knows.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>australian</strong>: Moonby. Got any Winstons?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Moonby what?</p>
<p><strong>australian</strong>: Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian
Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Oh, they’re simple enough people. It’s good
to see you, baby. Nobody has any Winstons?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: This boat’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Where’s Kurtz? I want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Oh, you don’t talk to Colonel Kurtz. You
listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you
know. It wasn’t easy.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Why did they attack us?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Simple. They don’t want him to go.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’re Australian?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Pre-Australian, actually. But I’d dig goin’
to California. I’m California dreamin’.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: So Kurtz is alive.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous
thing in every way that I’ve come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The
first thing he said is, ‘I’m going to shoot you because you are a
deserter.’ I said I didn’t desert from your army, I deserted from my
army. He said, ‘I’m going to shoot you just the same.’</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Why didn’t he shoot you?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: I’ve asked myself that question. I said to
myself, why didn’t he shoot me? He didn’t shoot me, because I had a
stash like you wouldn’t believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of
the Orient: Marijuana – Hashish – Opium – cocaine – uncut Heroin; the
Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid – I make Koolaid that makes purple
Owsley come on like piss. Now I’m Kurtz’ own Disciple – I listen he
talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there’s such a thing as
sleep. Everything. Of love, too.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Love?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Oh, no, not what you think… Cosmic love. He
made me see things – things, you know.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sounds like he’s gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: No, Colonel Kurtz couldn’t be crazy – if you
heard him talk, just last week, you’d never think he was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Is that where he is? By the shrunken
heads.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We’re going ashore. Tie her up – and leave
your guns up, Lance.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Bring your rifles, that’s all. Take us to
him.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Right on – he’s been waiting for –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: And shut up.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: His name is…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m not ever goin’ to tell you to shut up
again.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team… Special Forces.
F-82 – Col. Walter Kurtz, commanding.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: What – happened here.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: NVA regulars. They’re coming again tonight.
Tet – their big – assault.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m taking you back.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: Oh, no, don�t say that.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: Take us back. Take us back ! But, the
operation – the team. Colonel Kurtz has such plans for – the team.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Take me to him, Major.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: I had nothing to do with these operations – I
did not do the planning – none of us did. It was all Colonel Kurtz – he
was the genius. You’ll see – the genius of our Colonel. He should be
made a General, don’t you think? A General? It’s…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Colonel Kurtz, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I’m Kurtz.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Captain B.L. Willard reporting his
presence, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: At ease… Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Why did you come to … my province.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We were attacked – down river. We need
supplies and medical help.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You were not coming here, to see me?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: more difficult to go No – no, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You came up my river – in that small boat. So
simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like
we did. You are the final justice, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What do you mean, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: What other reason could you have come? A
Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right
about these things?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You know you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Then the Agency approached you. Maybe in a
bar in Quinon or Pleiku. Simple. A year’s pay for one life. Perhaps a
village elder, or a tax collector. Nobody’s orders but your own.
Exciting work.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You’ve spent tome at the Royal Tracking
School of Malaysia. I can tell from the way the laces on your boots are
tied. I understand you, Captain. We understand each other.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Do you know me ?</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Captain – they’ve been probed all this week –
Cong and NVA regulars. There’s gonna be a big offense any time.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Kurtz. I’m supposed to kill him, just like
he said.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Yeah, I can see that. He’s fuckin nuts –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: He killed that guy without feeling
anything.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: When you kill Cong, don’t you feel
something.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Sure. Recoil… I feel the recoil of my
rifle.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: This is good – triple overlapping fields of
fire – walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their
surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’ve done things, when I was alone in the
jungle – that I never told anyone about.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: This is evil – evil, Captain. We’re all gonna
die here.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: I don’t get it – You said your mission was to
kill him. Let’s do it, an’ get our asses outta here. This Kurtz is
ruining the war; I mean, this don’t look good for America !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … he’s an amazing officer.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: You got to kill this sonuvabitch – Lance and
me, we don’�t understand none of this – Jesus, Captain – I don’t wanna
die here – Do it quick.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>moonby</strong>: He’s asleep – don’t bother him.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I’m awake.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You. Get out.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I said get the fuck out ! I’m going to kill
the little weirdo myself tomorrow. when moving his He�s only stayed
alive this long because he’s a good orderly and medic. He knows how to
use a hypodermic.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’re gonna get hit tonight, bad – a whole
regiment of NVA regulars.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: That’s right, the little gook- pricks. But
they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their
guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That’s rich. We fight with
ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I’ll call
in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We’ll have ourselves a helluva
airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors’: ‘C’mon Baby
Light My Fire…’</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah, I like it…</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I love it.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You’ve gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: No. My thinking is clear. But my soul has
gone mad.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: My gut – Oh, Christ, my gut !</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Kill him – come on, why don’t you kill him</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Oh shit – on the table; morphine.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You see how stupid it would have been to blow
out my brains? I’m dying from the gut anyway.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: No – I don’t want to sleep. I want to think.
Water. Give me water.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You can’t have water after morphine.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Still playing by the rules. You’re a damn
good kiler.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: How’s the pain?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: How’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Pain is easy to handle – but nobility.. the
nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What Truth?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: The truth that you were sent here to murder
me, ans so far you haven’t done it. And do you know why? Yes, you know
why. Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you
on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that
nobody knows what they’re doing here. Except me.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Gimme water.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: No water.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You know what you’re doing? You are
interfering with my plans !</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: This water’s got Moonby’s acid in it –</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Drink it – drink it for tonight. Think of it.
A whole regiment of those shitty little Cong – War. Total war – war like
you’ve never known it. It’s beautiful – you’ll love it. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Lance – the fucker’s not gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Goddamn – You’ve gotta dig napalm on Speed,
too. It’s spectacular, you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Look into the jungle. You can’t – it’s too
terrible. You have to smear yourself with warpaint to look at it – you
have to be a cannibal. That’s why warpaint was invented. Then it becomes
your jungle.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: How did we get here?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Because of all the things we do, the thing we
do best – is lie.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I think think a lie stinks.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Oh Captain, that is so true.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Stinks. I could never figure – I could
never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm –
and not let them write the word ‘fuck’ on their airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: You could never figure it because it doesn’t
make sense.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Fuck no.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I’ll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes
! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We’ll bomb the shit out of them if they
don’t do what we want.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: We’ll exterminate the fuckers !</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Captain – kill him.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Think of it – for years, millions of years,
savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would
rain down from the sky. And goddamn, we made it happen. God bless Dow
!</p>
<p><strong>chef</strong>: Kill him !</p>
<p>****: Hot damn !</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant. Mini-gun.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Napalm.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Claymores, claymores.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Code – Street Gang – Street Gang !
Purgative air strike; Street Gang !</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Charles !</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Go away – hide yourself.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Going back - to the jungle to die.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m taking you back. You can still
live.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I had immense plans.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m gonna get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: I was on threshold of great things.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He was the tragedy – the tragedy of this
war.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Don’t. Don’t frighten them away.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: So you understand this?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Do I not?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: My river… my people… my jungle… my ideas… my
country… my wife… … my death.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You had immense plans… immense plans…</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I’m taking you back.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: The horror, the horror.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: How did they know?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: They must have seen the fire.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: They’re coming to rescue us. They’re
Medevac.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: They’re coming to take us back.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>colby</strong>: Colonel Kurtz, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: … Don’t remember a lot about my
rehabilitation… but I was sent back to the world before the fall of
Saigon…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: I never answered questions about Kurtz – I
gave them a few of his unimportant papers – but for the most part I
saved everything. There were other letters, personal ones written
earlier to his wife. I brought them to het. I watched the fall of Saigon
on television in a bar in Alameda…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Come in, Captain Willard.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Can I get anything for you?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Did you know him very well?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You get to know each other pretty well out
there.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: And you admired him?</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He was a remarkable man. It was impossible
not to –</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Love him… Yes, it is true. That’s the
hard part for me… I knew him better than anyone … I knew him best.</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: You knew him best.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: You were his friend… You must have
been, if he had given you this… If he sent you to his home. He was the
best this country had – he was –</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yes, I know…</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: I’ll never get over it – But I’ll
always remember him…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Both of us…</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Men looked up to him… He died as he
lived…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: His death was – yes, he died as he
lived.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Were you with him, when…</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: Yes I was… He said his last words to
me.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: What were they?</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz’s wife</strong>: Tell me what he said.</p>
<p><strong>kurtz</strong>: The horror ! The horror !</p>
<p><strong>willard</strong>: He spoke of you, ma’am.</p>
