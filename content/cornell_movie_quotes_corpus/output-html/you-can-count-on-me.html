<p><strong>mrs. prescott</strong>: Why do they always put braces on
teenage girls at the exact moment when they’re the most self-conscious
about their appearance?</p>
<p><strong>mr. prescott</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. prescott</strong>: Tom –</p>
<p><strong>mr. prescott</strong>: I see him…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. prescott</strong>: Tom!</p>
<p><strong>mr. prescott</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. prescott</strong>: Tom!</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with
glasses and a mustache, looks down at AMY.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Hello, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hi, Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Amy, would you please tell the kids you’ll
be right back, and then shut the door and come outside to talk to us for
a minute?</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Be right back, you guys!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You’re not supposed to go out, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She’s going to smoke a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy, come on! I’m really late!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: How was school?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: We’re supposed to write a story for English
homework, but they didn’t tell us what it’s supposed to be about.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I mean they didn’t tell us what it’s supposed
to be about. They said do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: So what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Nothing. I just think it’s unstructured.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I’m sure you’ll be able to think of
something. If you can’t, I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Don’t forget your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It’s not a backpack, it’s a knapsack.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Don’t forget your knapsack.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Give me a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Guess who’s been asking for you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh no, really?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, come in!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Mr. Everett?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah: Brian.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian. Hi. I’m Samantha Prescott – I’m the
lending officer?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in. Sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I am so sorry I was late…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, we missed you before…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I got held up. Believe me, it is not
something I make a habit of…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m sure it’s not. Actually – could you just,
could you close that door for me? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick
him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter’s house. Anyway,
Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with
you too…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well – Samantha – I realize that Scottsville
is not exactly a major banking center…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No it’s not…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No – I know it’s not… But it’s kind of a
personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up
to the same kinds of standards we’d be trying to meet if we were the
biggest branch in the state. And that means I don’t want anybody running
out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day.
Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? Does
your husband work in the area? Do you –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh – No – Rudy Sr. isn’t “on the scene.” So
to speak.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, I can give you a couple of days to make
some other arrangement, but…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – Brian? I understand what you’re
saying, and I think it’s great. I do. Because there’s a lot of things
around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I’ve honestly
been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does
take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch
hour…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’d really prefer it if you would make some
other arrangement. OK?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ll do my best…!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: How old’s your son?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: He’s eight.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s a terrific age.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: You got a letter from Uncle Terry.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Whose room is he gonna stay in?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: He can stay in the little room. But you know
what? He’s not going to live here. He’s only gonna stay for a little
while… And it’s OK if you don’t remember him, because you were only six
the last time he was here… But it’ll be nice if you got a chance to get
to know each other a little bit. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy? Would it distract you if I put on some
music?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Did you think of a story?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: My father.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What about your father?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It’s just a made-up story about him.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Can I read it when you’re done?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It’s not very good.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Anyway, Bob, it’s sort of this adventure
story, and Rudy’s father is this secret agent or something, working for
the government… And it just made me feel weird. You know? Because I
never really say much to him about Rudy Sr., because I don’t know what
to say. And I don’t know whether I should just let him imagine whatever
he wants to imagine, or whether I should sit him down sometime and tell
him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. You know?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well… I don’t know, Sammy. What have you told
him already?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Not much. He knows I don’t have the highest
opinion of him. And he knows I don’t want to see him or know anything
about him, ever. But I tried to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway… I could
go into a lot more detail, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well… It’s an interesting problem. But I don’t
really know what to tell you… It’s a little outside my personal field of
expertise…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’d be glad to give it some thought…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nothing… I’m just glad to see you… I’m glad you
called me.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I bet you were surprised…!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Um – a little.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I should get going…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yeah… I’ve got the baby-sitter… But… Thanks
for a lovely evening.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Hey, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Where’d you get the hat?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, I got it on the street for a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, you know, it’s pretty much your
standard woolen hat.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yeah, I had a very similar reaction to
it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Can I get that money from you?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yeah. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Is that all you have?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Can you borrow some cash from your
brother?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Um, yeah, but that would involve speaking to
him.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I’m definitely gonna be gone for a
couple of days at least, Sheila.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Why do you have to stay so long?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Because my sister is not a bank, you know? I
can’t just show up and ask her for –</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: You seem to think my brother’s a bank!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh Sheila can we just cut out the puerile
crap?! I’ll be back just as soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind of man
that everyone says I am.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: I know you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll call you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Don’t you wanna tell me you love me?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: That was really convincing.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… I think after this is over you should
seriously consider moving back home.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: You gonna call tonight?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>pov terry</strong>: The bus rolls past the hilltop
cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>pov terry</strong>: THE “WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE” SIGN whizzes
by. Houses start dotting the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hello?… TERRY!…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Whoa there!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: God damn! Terry Prescott! How you doin’?
Gimme a cuddle!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How you doin’, Darryl?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Which way you headed?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m just goin’ to see Sammy at Dawson’s…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Can I walk with you a little?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sure, yeah –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: So Sammy says you been out in Alaska…?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I was workin’ out there for a little
while…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: – Sammy says she’s gettin’ postcards from
all across the country.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been all over the place…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, it’s good to have you back here, I’ll
tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the peace.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, that’ll be a little harder now that
you’re home, but I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, man, I’m reformed.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thanks, Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sorry about yesterday –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don’t care –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I was studying the bus description… and I
just… I got on the wrong bus – I mean I missed my stop –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don’t care, Terry. I’m just so glad to see
you…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m glad to see you too, Sammy. Um… are you
coming from work?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Um, no, it’s Saturday…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, no, it’s just… you’re dressed so
formally…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh. No. You know, I just thought I’d – You
know I thought it was a special occasion… which it is…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, it’s good. I thought I’d dress up
too.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That’s OK. You look fine.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of
garments.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nothing, nothing… Um… So how are you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How’s Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: We’re fine, Terry. How are you? I mean –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – Where have you been lately, Terry?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: – I know, I haven’t been –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I got a postcard from you from Alaska…?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I was up there for a while…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: But that was in the Fall, Terry…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I know I’ve been out of touch…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I was a little worried. I mean –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, I been a lotta different places… Um… I
went down to Florida for a while… I was doing some work in Orlando… I’ve
been all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well… I just wish you would have let me know
you were OK…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. I didn’t realize it’d been so long…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Are you gonna stay in town for a while?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I don’t know… I got all these things I
gotta do back in Worcester…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …Yeah, so I’m probably not gonna be able to
stay more than a day or so…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh… Well… That’s all right…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …I’m kind of trying to keep to a schedule of
sorts. It’s a long and worthy story but I won’t trouble you with it
right now.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Are you expecting someone?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Who would I be expecting here?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You just keep looking around, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, I was just wondering if we could get some
more refreshments, actually.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ve actually got to confess to you, Sammy…
that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is
that I’ve been kind of unable to write… on account of the fact that I
was in jail for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You were what?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I did a little time, I guess, in
Florida. For, uh, just for bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was just bullshit…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I didn’t do anything. Does it occur to you
that maybe I was wronged?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, could I please –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh my God! –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Would you please let me –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I got into a fight in a bar down in Florida.
Which I was not the one who instigated it, at all. But they worked up
all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three
months. I didn’t write you because I didn’t want you to get all upset
about it. I just figured you’d figure I was on the road for a little
while. I know it was stupid and I’m sorry. I really didn’t mean to make
you worry. But you know what? I can’t run around all the time doin’
stuff or not doin’ stuff because it’s gonna make you worry! Because then
I come back here, and I tell you about my fuckin’… traumas, and I get
this wounded little “I’ve Let You Down” bullshit, over and over again,
and it really just – cramps me! Like I just want to get out from under
it!… And here I am back in this fuckin’ hole explaining myself to you
again!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: OK – Can you please stop cursing at me?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I mean, I realize I’m in no position to, uh,
basically say anything, ever – But it’s not like I’m down there in some
redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper’s boyfriend
and I suddenly think, “Hey! Maybe this’d be a good time to really stick
it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months.”</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Me too, man. I mean “welcome home.”</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hey – You don’t write me for six months, I
have no idea where you are –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – I don’t know if you’re alive or dead –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – and then you show up out of nowhere and
tell me you were in jail?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Sammy, I’m
really sorry…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sammy…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um… I’m in the midst of a slight
predicament…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What do you need? Money?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um… Yeah… I’m broke. I gotta get back to
Worcester tomorrow. I got this girl there, and she’s kind of in a bad
situation…? I just need to borrow some money. Whatever you can spare.
I’ll pay you back… I’ll pay you back, man.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I really wish Mom was here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: So do I, man.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Nobody knows what to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know how they feel, man.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Terry? Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – I mean, do you ever go to church
anymore?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about that
shit?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um – No, Sammy. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Can you tell me why not?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um, yeah. Because I think it’s
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – can you tell me without like,
denigrating what I believe in?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Because I think it’s primitive, OK? I think
it’s a fairy tale.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – I mean, have you ever considered that
maybe that’s part of what’s making things so difficult for you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – That you’ve lost hold of – well, not just
your religious feeling, but lost hold of any kind of anchor, any kind of
trust in anything… I mean no wonder you drift around so much. What could
ever stop you? How would you ever know if you had found the right
thing?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, uh, I’m not really looking for
anything, man. I’m just, like, trying to get on with it.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Thank you, Sammy… I’m really gonna pay this
back.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: To pick up Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… do you not even want me to visit now?
’Cause I can catch the bus at five o’clock if that’s what you want.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, of course I want you to visit, you
idiot! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you more than anything! I’ve
been telling everyone I know that you were coming home! I cleaned the
whole fucking house so it would look nice for you! I thought you were
gonna stay for at least a few days! It didn’t occur to me that you were
just broke again. I wish you would have just sent me an invoice!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi, is that Malcolm?… Hi, this is Terry
Prescott?… I been trying to get ahold of Sheila and there’s no answer,
and I was just wondering if she – She what?…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: When?… Well – Is she all right?… Well, could
I talk to her?… Well, could you give her a message that I –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That girl I’m with tried to kill herself.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She tried to kill herself.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Do you have everything you need?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know. Send the money I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Maybe you should stay home for a little
while, Terry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, maybe that’d be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m going to bed. Do you have everything you
need?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Terry, I’m really glad you’re home.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, me too, Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: OK. So we’ll drop Rudy off at the bus, then
all you have to do is drop me off at the bank, and just pick Rudy up at
3:30 in front of town hall, and drive him over to Carol’s house. And
that’s it. She’s on Harvey Lane, right past where the Dewitts used to
live.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy knows where she lives.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: God, Mabel, don’t those colors hurt your
eyes?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Oh no, they keep me fresh.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah! Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn this time
sheet in at the end of the day, or do you want it at the end of the
week…?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh, yeah, end of the day’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Seems like an awful lot of extra
paperwork…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I like paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>pov rudy</strong>: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood
of Sammy’s car, smoking.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: You showed up.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Looks that way.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Put on your seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It pushes on my neck.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: It pushes on my neck. It’s uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, when somebody slams into us and you go
sailin’ through the windshield, that’s liable to be uncomfortable too.
So put on your seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Mom’s parents died in a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know. They’re my parents too.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: They are?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: So that means we have the same parents.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Um – Carol just called. She said Terry and
Rudy never showed up at her house?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: Brian, talking to an employee, sees
Sammy, across the bank, hurrying out the employees’ exit.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey. Look.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You hold it further down, you’re gonna get a
lot more power. You should be able to put that nail down with two or
three hits. Look:</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That’s not the way I hold it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, the way you hold it is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why can’t I just do it my own way?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You can.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian? Did you want to see me?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah. I was kind of wondering what happened
to you today.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh – Didn’t Mabel – I had a false alarm about
my son…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, I kind of thought you were gonna work
that out.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I did work it out – more or less –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Then why’re you running outta here in the
middle of the day without a word of explanation to me, Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian, don’t yell at me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m – I’m not yelling. I’m just gettin’ a
little frustrated here.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well Brian:</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sorry, could you close the door please?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: …And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo, with his
wife and two sons, if you can believe it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That is depressing.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: He just never struck me as the marrying type,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Who are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wild kids we used to know.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Were you a wild kid?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Not compared to your Mom.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You don’t believe me?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Mom, were you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No comment.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh – Just readin’ some of your
compositions.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why are you smoking?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um… Because it’s bad. Don’t ever do it.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know this used to be my room?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah… Do you want it back?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Did you fight in Vietnam?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No. I wasn’t even born yet.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Were you ever in the army?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: My father was in the army.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know. Unfortunately he didn’t fight in
Vietnam either.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Were you friends with him?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Not really. We had some friends in common, I
guess… I didn’t like him very much.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, he wasn’t very likable.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know. He was always – He always had
to be better than you at everything. You know. Like if you were all
playing basketball or something, everybody’s havin’ like a friendly game
and he’s like ready to kill somebody if his team didn’t win. Or like if
you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one?
Kinda gets annoying after a while. Plus it was pretty scummy how he
split on your mom and you… He was a prick. Probably still a prick.
Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had
some bad luck and you had some good luck. You mind if I ask you a
personal question?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do you like it here? I mean, in
Scottsville?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t know. My friends are here… I like the
scenery… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I know, I know, but it’s so… There’s nothing
to do here.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yes there is.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No there isn’t, man! It’s narrow. It’s dull.
It’s a dull, narrow town full of dull, narrow people who don’t know
anything except… what things are like right around here. They have no
perspective whatsoever. No scope. They might as well be living in the
nineteenth century because they have no idea what’s going on, and if you
try to tell ‘em that, they wanna fuckin’ kill you.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah. This doesn’t apply to you directly,
Sammy, but I’ve noticed that some of the employees have their PC
monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors… Purple and polka dots or
what have you. And it’s not a big deal, but really, this is a bank. You
know? It’s not really appropriate. So I’m just asking that people stick
to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Like I say, it doesn’t really apply to
you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No, my computer palette’s pretty
conservative.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bob Steegerson.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What are you wearing?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do you know you have an enormous leak from
the upstairs hall?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Um, yeah, thanks, I did.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Are you guys sure you’re gonna be</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What is happening here?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s just – The problem is that the pipe is
corroded all the way along the length of the hall. So every time I put
in a new piece it starts leaking further down.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Why don’t I just call the plumber?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why? He’s not gonna do anything different
than what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah. We’re making it worse!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No we’re not. Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Thank you. Thank you both.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Now, call if there’s any problem, and if I’m
not there, I’m either on my way or on my way back home.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: So lights out at ten… and don’t spend the
whole night watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nice to meet you, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s your idea of the whole night?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Two hours tops.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s your feeling about Bob?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t really know him that well.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I have bad news for you.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: No…!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Great. What are we supposed to do now?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do you know how to play pool?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’ve played it.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t think they let kids in there.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, we’re not allowed to watch any more TV,
so it’s this or nothing… But if we run into any trouble, let me do the
talking.</p>
<p><strong>pov rudy</strong>: A lot of men and women at the bar or in
booths, eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he follows
Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him – some of the looks
are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., what’s a kid doing in
here?</p>
<p><strong>at the pool table</strong>: Terry and Rudy stand side by side
facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table. Terry
waves a few bills.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I got a hundred bucks here says me and my
nephew can beat anybody in here. Only we gotta get the next game ’cause
he’s gotta be in bed by ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool
Player are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy
coaching him.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Just hit it nice and soft… Nice and soft.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: God damn, Rudy. I thought you said you could
play.</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS – WHACK! –
The balls scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking
up his cue.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Boys, it’s all over but the cryin’.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: Of Terry running the table and everyone
watching. Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball off
three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball into the side.
Rudy watches him.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Bob… Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I… I don’t know what to say. I –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I mean, I know I haven’t exactly been the most…
decisive… guy. In the past… I don’t know: I’m tired of foolin’ around.
And I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I… I’m totally… I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, you could always say “Yes.” Or you could
think about it first.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That’s it: I want to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: OK… Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ohhhh!</p>
<p><strong>a few moments later</strong>: Terry and Rudy sit side by side
watching as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them and
the camera, running the table. “Oohs” and “All rights” emit from the
spectators.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s all yours, baby.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Just make sure to hit it really gentle. But
firm. And hit it a little low so you get some backspin. Don’t even hit
it. Just kiss it.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What do you mean, kiss it?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I mean tap it. Firm but very, very softly.
And don’t shoot until you know it’s going in. OK?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That was great!</p>
<p><strong>at the bar</strong>: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies,
drinking a pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.</p>
<p><strong>at the pool table</strong>: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him
upside down. Rudy laughs.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: We creamed those guys! We creamed them!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ssh…! Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s them!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I can’t get my sleeve out…!</p>
<p><strong>outside the house</strong>: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves
back as he drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What is going on in here?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Um – We were just out doing some star-gazing,
and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time. Which I totally warned him about.
You are a bad kid.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey: I think it’s OK. Just don’t tell her
where we went, ’cause she’ll be really mad at me. OK?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey – I’m not kidding, Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I won’t!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Did you know my Mommy used to take me and
Uncle Terry out at night to look at the constellations?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Did you see that one, what’s the one – It
looks like a big “W”? Cassiopeia?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Ow! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve got a great idea. Why don’t you let me
call the plumber?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Do whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh, does that make you mad?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: Brian turns on his PC. The SCREEN
lights up. The COLORS are a garish GREEN and ORANGE.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: SAMMY and BRIAN are both on their feet. The
door is closed.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian, get off my ass!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I didn’t change the colors on your stupid
computer screen.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, that’s all you gotta say!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: There is nothing wrong with the work I do
here. I have been doing just fine, the whole time before you came here –
And if you think that riding people in this petty, ridiculous way is the
way to improve service in this bank or anywhere else I think you’re out
of your mind!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I didn’t say there was. Could I please –
Could I please – May I respond?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No, that’s really all I have to –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: May I respond? First of all, I don’t
appreciate being spoken to with that kind of language. That’s not the
way I talk to you, and I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t talk that way
to me –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Second of all, if you say you didn’t change
the colors on my computer screen, then of course I accept your answer.
But you and I are gonna have to find a way to work together –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: But that’s not gonna happen with the
attitude, it’s not gonna happen with the lateness, it’s not gonna happen
by fighting me every step of the way – OK, well not you, you’re not
late, but too much of that stuff goes on around here –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I am not late and I do not have an attitude –
Well then don’t tell me I’m late if I’m not late!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’d really like to finish!</p>
<p><strong>outside brian’s office</strong>: The whole staff is listening
to the muffled raised VOICES from inside the office.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: They were where?</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: A YOUNG PLUMBER, about Terry’s age, comes
thumping down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his
toolbox. Terry looks up at him.</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: OK, you’re all set.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my wife,
Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is Mabel…</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: This is Sammy, our lending officer. Sammy,
this is my wife, Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hi. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Brian – I gotta sit down.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sure – Let’s go in my office.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m fine…!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian…?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Look, I’m glad you guys are getting along so
well – like, you have no idea – but if I can’t rely on you to remember
to get him once a day…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You can!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – And what are you doing taking him to play
pool in the middle of the night, and then telling him to lie to me about
it?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re going to Carol’s house and I’m going
home.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why can’t I come with you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Because if you’re such a baby you gotta tell
your Mommy about us playin’ pool when I totally asked you not to, and I
gotta listen to her shit all day, then you’re goin’ to the baby-sitter’s
so you can stay at the baby house.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: But I didn’t tell her!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know what? Don’t even fuckin’ talk to
me.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Just get out of the car.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re working late.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: How did your wife like the bank?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh, fine. She wasn’t feeling so great.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No – I don’t mean – She’s not ill. She’s
just… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s it. She’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: It can make you kind of cranky.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Listen, I’m sorry we’ve been stepping on each
other’s toes – I – I’m not actually that bad a guy –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yeah, I am too… I know you’re not, Brian, but
you’re driving everybody crazy.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, I – I’m just trying to do my best here
– And I’m gettin’ it from all sides.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know you are…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Anyway… We’ll work it out…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well… I could use a beer.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I could use a tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Last I heard, Rudy’s Dad was living over in
Auburn. But that was last year.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Must be so tough raising a kid on your own…
Although I’m beginning to get the idea my wife wouldn’t mind a crack at
it.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh… It’s just the hormones.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, no, it isn’t. But never mind.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, here’s to improved employee- management
relations.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You can’t judge all of Scottsville by the
people in that bank, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well – Let’s – Let’s not talk about the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Let’s just forget about the bank for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I want you to tell me who changed the colors
on my computer screen.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ll never tell.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Kind of a late dinner, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yeah. How was Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Did the plumber come?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yes, the fucking plumber came.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Terry – Give me a break!!!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Nothing. I’m just tired.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You want to smoke some pot?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No I don’t. Why, you got some?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: So… Bob asked me to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Wow. Are you going to?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don’t know. If he’d’ve asked me this time
last year I would have probably said yes. But the minute he said it, I
don’t know, I felt like somebody was trying to strangle me.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… bad sign.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know. Plus, Terry… I fucked my boss…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know! And his wife is six months
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Jesus Christ, Sammy…!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Terry, I’m sorry I got so mad before. I just
don’t want him, you know – terrified of “telling,” if there’s –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Uh, well, that’s not really his problem,
Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh really? What’s his problem?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: His problem is that he’s like totally
sheltered because you treat him like he’s three, instead of eight, so
that’s how he behaves.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh yeah? And how do you think he should
behave?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I think he shouldn’t have to run and tell his
Mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one
thing.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Uh huh. And what do you –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I mean I took him to play pool! It was a
little clandestine thing we did for fun! It wasn’t like a big secret, I
mean who cares? I was actually trying to be nice to him. But he’s so
freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin’ squeal
on me and I have to listen to your fuckin’ shit all day when I didn’t
even fuckin’ do anything!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: First of all, he didn’t tell me anything:
Darryl did. OK? Second of all, I don’t really give a shit if you took
him to play pool: I was mad at you because you left him standing at the
bus stop in the rain. But no, I don’t want you telling him not to
squeal, because I don’t want him put in that position!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… that… is a perfect example of what I’m
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You are in idiot.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Darryl told you?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, good morning. Could you get the
door?</p>
<p><strong>outside the office</strong>: Sammy shuts the door. MABEL and
DORIS, standing near the door, look at each other: i.e., Sammy’s in
trouble again.</p>
<p><strong>inside the office</strong>: Sammy stands by the closed door.
Brian comes out around his desk.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Listen – I just –</p>
<p><strong>outside the office</strong>: The employees click away at
their PCs. Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck.</p>
<p><strong>inside the office</strong>: Brian has Sammy pressed against
the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their
underwear out of the way. It’s not so easy in their office clothes.
Sammy tears away.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: OK. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>outside the office. a moment later</strong>: Sammy comes out
of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She heads
down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and
surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re awfully quiet.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Um… Have you thought at all about what I
said?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Of course I’ve been thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So… Any decisions? Or – do you still want to
think about it some more…?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – I mean – I don’t know, Bob. I mean, we
haven’t exactly been going steady the last few months, if you know what
I mean –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, no, I know –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – and then we see each other twice and you
suddenly say you want to get married? I mean…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, you’re right, you’re right –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know… I… Maybe this is… Last year I
sort of thought you were possibly interested in that… idea… but I was
the one who, you know, wasn’t “ready” at that point – So that’s why I
thought things kind of slowed down with us…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Don’t make me feel bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t want you to feel bad for me.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It’s Brian.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m buying milk. I just thought I’d say
hello.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look, I know it’s probably too late, but is
there any way you can come out for a little while?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian, I think you’re going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I know I am. Can you meet me?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Um, OK.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Um – I have to go out for a minute. Do you
want anything?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I just have to go out for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, where?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I just have to go to Mabel’s house.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You know what, Rudy? It’s personal. This is a
personal matter that has to do with Mabel. I just have to go see her for
a little while.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Listen. Listen. I’m sorry I said you squealed
on me. I was totally out of line, and I really owe you an apology. Did
you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: What’s on your mind, Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, a lot. But principally… I was just
wondering if you had an opinion. If you know someone, in your family, or
just someone you really care about, and they just can’t seem to get
ahold of themselves…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know who this is for?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s right, my little friend. Hello. We’re
going fishing.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I got a new rod and reel, five lures, I got a
hat, I got a knife and I got a fish scaler.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That’s great, honey.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… I’m not really sure why you’re here,
Ron. I mean, I realize I haven’t exactly been a model citizen since I
got here, but compared to how things have been goin’ for me lately, I
thought I was doing pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And I also find it kind of discouraging that
you seem to think I need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have
you, so much so that you’re willing to disregard the fact that I don’t
believe in any of this stuff at all –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well… I didn’t mean to discourage you –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I mean it’s really kind of insulting.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Can I say something here? Sammy asked me to
come and talk to you, because it’s her opinion that you’re not gonna
find what you’re looking for the way you’re looking for it –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How would she know?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: But I’m really not here to try to get you to do
anything, or to believe anything. And I’ll tell you the same thing I
told her, which is that as far as I’m concerned the only way she can
help you is by her example – by trying to be a model for you, by the way
she lives her life…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: And that doesn’t mean she’s supposed to be a
saint, either, if that’s what you’re smiling about.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I didn’t realize I was smiling.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: You know, Terry, a lot of people come to see me
with all kinds of problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital problems, sexual
problems, health problems –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Great job you got.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well… I like it. Because even in this little
town, I feel like what I do is very connected with the real center of
people’s lives. I’m not saying I’m always Mr. Effective, but I don’t
feel like my life is off to the side of what’s important. You know? I
don’t feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to
trouble within myself or trouble in other people. I don’t feel like a
negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void,
with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of
whatever little philosophies I can scrape together on my own…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think your life is
important?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You mean – Like, me personally, my individual
life?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… I’m not sure – What do you mean? It’s
important to me. I guess. And like, to my, you know, the people who care
about me…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: But do you think it’s important?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Do you think it’s important in the scheme of
things? Not just because it’s yours, or because you’re somebody’s
brother. Because I don’t really get the impression that you do.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I don’t think… I don’t particularly
think anybody’s life has any particular importance besides whatever –
you know – whatever we arbitrarily give it. Which is fine. I mean we
might as well… I think I’m as important as anybody else…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know: A lot of what you’re saying has
a real appeal to me, Ron. A lot of the stuff they told us when we were
kids… But I don’t want to believe something or not believe it because I
might feel bad. I want to believe it because I think it’s true or not…
I’d like to think that my life is important… Or that it’s connected to
something important…</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well, isn’t there any way for you to believe
that without calling it God, or religion, or whatever term it is you
object to?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yes. I believe that.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: So Sammy, what example will you be setting
for us tonight?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What time are we getting up to go fishing?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: We’re not going fishing.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I think you should go fishing with Father
Ron.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t want to go fishing with Father
Ron.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, I’m not takin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ll take you, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I realize that you’re mad at me –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m not mad at you…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – but he didn’t do anything to you. And you
cannot promise a little boy that you’re gonna –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …I just, you know, after all that religious
conversation, I just realized it’s probably not so good for him to be
spending so much time with someone like me who doesn’t believe his life
is important in the scheme of things –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Would you please…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Listen. I am sure, if you put your mind to
it, you can think of some other way of getting back at me besides this.
So would you please just give it some thought, and take him fishing
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I would, Sammy, I just don’t think it’d be
good for him.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You suck.</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: BRIAN’S LIVING ROOM. NANCY, watching TV on
the sofa with Brian, picks up the RINGING PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: BOB’S KITCHENETTE. Bob, making a sandwich
for himself, picks up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>pov sammy</strong>: Beyond Brian and Nancy, TERRY pulls up at
the curb in her car. He rummages around and produces FISHING RODS which
he waves, somewhat sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>reverse</strong>: At top speed, Rudy runs away from Sammy and
the church, toward Terry and the car. Terry and Sammy exchange a look
from the distance.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Anyway… I don’t know what the church’s
position is on adultery and fornication these days, but I felt really
hypocritical not saying anything to you about it before, so… What is the
official position on that stuff these days?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well… it’s a sin.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Good: I think it should be.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: …but we don’t tend to focus on that aspect of
it, right off the bat –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I think you should.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Maybe it was better when you came in and they
screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really
mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it’d be
better if you told me how I’m endangering my immortal soul, and if I
don’t quit I’m going to burn in hell. Don’t you ever think that?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Um… No.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, it’s a lot better than all this “Why do
you think you’re in this situation” psychological bullshit you hear all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Well… Why do you think you’re in this
situation?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: With which one?</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: All of them.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I feel sorry for them. Isn’t that
ridiculous?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I’ve never been so bored in my life.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah… We really shoulda been out here around
seven or eight A.M.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What time is it now?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Two-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Was my father a good fisherman?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, your father was good at all that stuff.
He knew everything about the woods, everything about fishing, everything
about hunting and everything about cars. If he wasn’t such a pain in the
ass he would’ve been a lot of fun to be around.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Maybe he’s nicer now.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Well, I think he is.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: How would you know? Did you ever meet
him?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Were you ever curious to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, he doesn’t live very far from here.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I thought he lived in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No – I lived in Alaska. Your dad lives in
Auburn. Far as I know. We could look him up in the phone book. Wanna
try?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: OK – But – I’m sure I don’t have to say this,
but I’m not kidding, man: Don’t – tell – your – mother.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you want to go for a walk, or a drive? It’s
really nice out.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No. I’m not gonna stay long. Bob, I don’t
want to get married.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’ve really thought about it a lot, and if
you had asked me last year I’m sure I would have said yes.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: But I’m not sure it would have been a good
idea then either. I’m going through a really hard time right now and I
just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the
stupidest most self-destructive thing I could possibly do.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: And I really think you have to grow up.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well, how about we fix up my personality some
other time?</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: I really hope we can still be friends.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Bob… This is so crazy… I mean… I don’t even
understand why you… I don’t even get it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you want me to say? Everything you said
about me was true, Sammy. I was just a big chickenshit jerk, and now I’m
payin’ the price.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Bob…!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. Sammy, I love you. I wish I could
say it in a more interesting way. I just – I love you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – I mean – I love you too –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I gotta go. I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where do you have to go?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m supposed to – I gotta get Mabel back her
car.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Well… I don’t understand. How are we leaving
things?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh God, I don’t know. Call me later.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Sorry I’m so late.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, I was just about to give up on you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – maybe it would’ve been better if you
had…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I mean – Look, I don’t mean to be
unsympathetic about your domestic situation, whatever it is, but I’m
just beginning to think that if people tried a little harder to stick to
their commitments and started taking a little responsibility for their
actions, they might end up having a lot less trouble generally. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, that’s what I’ve been trying to tell you
guys at the bank.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I really don’t think I can do this
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: This is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That is not what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Maybe we should call first.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well – We’re right here.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: His last name is Kolinski?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Ring the bell.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi. We’re looking for Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Who should I say is calling?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: An old friend.</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: He says an old friend!</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: How old is he?</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hi, I’m Terry.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: And this is Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Rudy, meet Rudy.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: I’ll just be in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: OK if we come in for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: What the hell are you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you mean what am I doin’ –</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Could you step away from the door
please?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well we just wanna –</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Could you step away from the door
please?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All right, all right.</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I just wanted the kid to see you –</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Well, now he saw me. Now you saw me. OK?
Now would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Man, you are really –</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Look: I’m tryin’ to be polite. So would
you just take off? It’s OK: Just take off.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I just wanna –</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: Do you know what you’re doin’? Just get
outta here!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You know what, man? You’re still a fuckin’
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: I’m an asshole? Get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: Get your fuckin’ hands off him…!</p>
<p><strong>a few moments later</strong>: The cops have arrived. The 1ST
COP is talking to Rudy and Janie. The 2ND COP is talking to Terry. Rudy
Sr.’s face looks puffy and beaten up. A 3RD COP stands apart with Rudy,
who is watching the whole thing. WE CUT rapidly and jerkily through this
section:</p>
<p><strong>1st cop</strong>: And you’re not the boy’s legal
guardian?</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: I don’t even know if that’s my kid!</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: They just showed up! We never seen them
before…</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: I used to know his sister –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I just came down here to talk to the guy and
all of a sudden he starts shovin’ me!</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Listen up. Listen up. You’re gonna have to
step back and just calm down –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You’re a lyin’ fuckin’ piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: You’re gonna have to step back.</p>
<p><strong>janie</strong>: We have a right to protect ourselves. What
else do you need to know?</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: The 2ND COP puts handcuffs on Terry.
Rudy watches.</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Now give me your right hand…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: This is such bullshit. He started the whole
thing and you’re arresting me?</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: Listen up. Now – Listen up! Stop talkin’.
Terry, stop talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>a moment later</strong>: As the 3RD COP walks Rudy to one cop
car, Rudy watches the 2ND COP guide the HANDCUFFED TERRY into the other
car.</p>
<p><strong>2nd cop</strong>: – idea where we might be able to contact
his mother?</p>
<p><strong>rudy sr.</strong>: No, because he’s not my Goddamn kid.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh my gosh.</p>
<p><strong>a few moments later</strong>: Sammy and Brian are on opposite
sides of the bed, getting dressed.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, you know, Nancy’s gonna be gone for the
rest of the week…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You know… Brian…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I don’t want to… I mean, couldn’t we
just… I mean, could we give it a rest?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Um – Yeah. Sure. If you want to.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I mean… I just think… I don’t know: We had a
great little fling. You know? Let’s not push it. I mean, is that OK? I
just –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah. Sure. OK. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: So are we still friends?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Mm hm. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: All right. Good…!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Around two o’clock this afternoon… Yeah, a
ninety three Toyota Tercel. New York plates V127AC… Please.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Thanks for coming over. I just want to have a
car handy just in case.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – what about other towns?… Yes! Yes! I
called the highway patrol four times… Well what am I supposed to do all
night?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Anyone hear from Sammy this morning?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears from her
ever again, will you let me know?</p>
<p><strong>mabel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: It’s gonna be all right… We got on the
phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a little bit and he’s calmed down, just
wants to forget about the whole thing…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Darryl, I really appreciate this…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah, it’s Brian.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Brian –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What the hell happened to you today,
lady?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re fired!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Is there anything you want to ask me, about
your father?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Oh, that wasn’t my father.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: That wasn’t him. I heard him tell the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: No – Rudy – that was him. But that was him. I
wish it wasn’t, but it was.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: No it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy. Yes it was. Your father’s name is Rudy
Kolinski. He lives in Auburn…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Could you turn that off for a minute
please?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You don’t have to say anything, Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I want you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I mean I don’t think you should live here
anymore. I don’t think you know how to behave around an eight-year- old
and I don’t know how to make you stop, so I think you shouldn’t live
here. I don’t know what else to say.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know how to behave around an
eight-year-old?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: That’s right –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I think you don’t know how to behave around
an eight-year-old.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Are you out of your MIND!?!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Now you just listen to me. I may not be the
greatest mother in the world, but I’m doing the best I know how. And he
doesn’t need you to rub his face in shit because you think it’s good for
him. He’s going to find out the world is a horrible place and that
people suck soon enough, and without any help from you. Believe me!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I think you should get your own place. I
thought, if you want, you could – I’ll be glad to help you out
financially –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: What do you mean, Get my own place?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I mean I –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You mean in Scottsville?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Why would I do that? Why don’t I just leave,
period?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well… If that’s what you want to do, that’s
fine. But that’s not what I’m saying. You are a very important person to
Rudy, and you are the most important person to me. But I’m saying that I
can’t take any more of this –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: – I thought – maybe you could sell your half
of the house to me, and I could pay you whatever it is over a certain
amount of time, and that way –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, you know what? I’ll just go.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – that’s not what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I don’t know. I just want to get out of this
town. And if you’ve got any sense when you get old enough you’ll get out
of here too. Your Mom’s gonna live in this town for the rest of her
life, and you know why? Because she thinks she has to. Don’t ask me why,
but that’s the truth. She thinks there’s all these things she has to do,
but you want to know one thing about your Mom? She’s a bigger fuck- up
than I ever was. I mean, I know I messed up. You think I enjoy getting
thrown in jail because I wanted you to face that prick your Dad like a
little man and see what kind of a guy he is? I know I got a little
carried away, and I lost my temper just a little bit – which is not the
end of the world either, by the way, just for future reference –And now
she’s kickin’ me out of my own house because – you know, because I
fucked up a little bit. Which I totally admit. I was like – totally
ready to admit that.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I could go with you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well, thanks, man. But I, uh, I can’t really
take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Is that for you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah, I’m just gonna stay at Ray’s till I
take off.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You don’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah. Well, that’s what I wanna do, so –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well but – Are you gonna come back to say
good-bye?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No – I’m just gonna take off. I’ll see you
later.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Look. I know you’re upset about Uncle Terry
leaving, and so am I. But he’s just not in control of himself, and I
don’t want him hurting your feelings anymore – or mine. And you may not
like it, but that’s how it’s gotta be. OK?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You don’t care. I don’t care either.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well… I’m sorry you’re havin’ all this
trouble…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: But you made a pretty good speech to me
yesterday about people sticking to their commitments…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Yeah…?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well… you made a commitment to this bank,
Sammy. To this job.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I know I’d –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: And to working things out with this tough new
son of a bitch boss of yours. And whatever might have passed between us
after hours doesn’t mean you just walk away from that commitment – yeah,
even when you have a legitimate family emergency.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m really sorry I didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Which is why I think in the calm cold light
of day, we should both think real hard about whether or not you really
want to continue on here at Merchants National Trust.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You’re not serious.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …you’re not happy, I’m not happy, it’s not
good for you and it sure as heck isn’t good for the bank.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You know you’re the worst manager we’ve ever
had?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Come on, Sammy…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: By far the worst.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: …I don’t wanna trade insults with you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I don’t want to be fired, Brian. I’ve
been working here for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: And if I were you I’d be a little nervous
about firing an employee I just had an affair with. OK?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s – Don’t threaten me, Sammy: I’m not
threatening you. I – It’s just an area I think we should explore.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I’m not thr – You explore it. I’m going back
to work.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today because
there’s no one else to do it. But I’ll find someone as soon as I have
time.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Yeah. Fine. Why don’t you just take over the
whole bank?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I called where Uncle Terry said he was
gonna stay, and there was no answer, so I don’t know if he’s still in
town or not.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy? Are you not speaking to me?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, I’m sorry you’re so mad at me, but I
only did what I thought I had to do, and I hope you don’t stay mad at me
for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Rudy, that’s too much.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You gotta cut this out!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You don’t know what you’re talking about!
There was nothing else I could do! I can’t explain it better than that,
but you can’t go on like this because you don’t know anything about it
and you don’t know what you’re doing!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: OK, I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don’t want you to be sorry, I just want you
to STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: I will! I will! I’m stopping, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: See? I’m stopping! I’m not doing it. See? I’m
not.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Ray’s house.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I didn’t know if you left yet.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No – I’m leavin’ tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – What time?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: There’s a bus at nine.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well – Can I – I’d like to see you before you
go. I mean, can I give you a lift? Or do you want to have breakfast or
anything? And I think Rudy would really like to say good- bye.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah – I don’t know… I mean –</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Terry, you can’t just leave like this. I
–</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All right, all right. I’ll come by in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: All right – But just – We have to be out of
the house by eight, so – I don’t want to tell Rudy you’re coming unless
you really think you can make it –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Yeah – No – I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You should get your sneakers on.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Sweetie, I’m sorry, we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Why can’t I miss school one day?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, how’s it goin’, man?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: So Rudy… If I write you a letter, will you
write me back?</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: OK, well, that’s gonna be pretty nice for
you, because I write a pretty Goddamn interesting letter.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Yeah, we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: All right. Well, say good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>rudy</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Do you need some cash for the bus?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No, I got a few bucks… Aren’t you gonna be
late for work?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh – Yeah. That’s OK. Terry, I don’t even
know where you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Oh, well, I didn’t really have a concrete
plan yet. I have to go back to Worcester and get my stuff…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Oh, are you gonna try to see that girl?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Well… Yeah… You know… Thought maybe I’d try
to show my face… Let her brother have a crack at me…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: …I don’t want anyone to have a crack at
you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I’m just kidding. I just thought… Just
thought I’d check up on her… Anyway, after that, I don’t really know.
I’ve been thinking about Alaska a lot. I still got some friends out
there. I don’t really know. Anyway, I’ll write you.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: You will?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: What is gonna happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Nothing too bad… But I gotta tell you, I know
things didn’t work out too well this time…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Well, Terry –</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: …but it’s always really good to know that
wherever I am, whatever stupid shit I’m doing, you’re back at my home,
rooting for me.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I do root for you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, Sammy. Everything’s gonna be all
right… Comparatively… And I’ll be back this way…</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I feel like I’m never gonna see you
again…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Of course you will, Sammy. You never have to
worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Please don’t go till you know where you’re
going. Please…!</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I do know where I’m going. I’m going to
Worcester and I’m gonna try to see that girl. And then depending on what
happens there, I thought I’d try to see if there’s any work for me out
West. And if there is, I’m gonna head out there for the summer and try
to make some money. And if there isn’t, I’ll figure something else out.
Maybe I’ll stay around the East. I don’t know… I really liked it in
Alaska. It was really beautiful. You just – It made me feel good. And
before things got so messed up I was doin’ pretty well out there.
Seriously. But I couldn’t stay here long, Sammy: I don’t want to live
here. But I’m gonna stay in touch. And I’ll be back. ’Cause I want to
see you and I want to see Rudy. I’ll come home for Christmas. How about
that? We’ll have Christmas together. Come on, Sammy. You can trust
me…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Come on, Sammy… Look at me… Look at me…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Hey, Sammy… Remember when we were kids,
remember what we always used to say to each other . . .? Remember when
we were kids?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Of course I do…!</p>
