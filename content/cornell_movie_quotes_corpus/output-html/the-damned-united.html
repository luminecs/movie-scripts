<h1 id="the-damned-united">the-damned-united</h1>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: I’m just going to make a brief statement.</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: “JULY 4th, 1974”</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: the sound of a flat Teeside voice,
singing along with Frank Sinatra on the radio…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “Fly me to the Moon..”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: “And let me play among the stars..”</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: When are we there?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Any moment now. On the right. “Let me see
what spring is like…”</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: There it is! Dad! There it is!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: “..on Jupiter and Mars..”</p>
<p><strong>boy 1</strong>: Where are you going? Dad? You’ve missed
it.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We’ve something else to do first. Won’t take
long.</p>
<p><strong>4 con tinue d: 4</strong>: CLO UGH</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts
his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the
most successful manager in the club’s history, under whom Leeds have won
everything..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European
Cup…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: …but pretty much everything else.
Daunted?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking forward
to it.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The biggest challenge of your life, and
you’ll be without Peter Taylor, for the first time. Your lifelong
professional colleague.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Yes, Pete’s at Brighton now. He had the
opportunity to come with me, but Brighton was his choice. Leeds was
mine.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: A surprising choice, some might say.
Because you’ve been very vocal in your criticism of them over the
years.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’ve accused players of dirty tactics,
cheating, dissent, foul play. You called Norman Hunter, Norman “Bites
yer legs” Hunter, you’ve said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches
him…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And I was right.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m curious. Why do you now show such
alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for
so long?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Goodness, it’s going to take me half an hour
to explain all those words for a start.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: ..they’ve been champions but they’ve not
been good champions in the sense of wearing the crown well. They’ve not
been loved. But then that’s hardly surprising, given the type of
operation there’s been in place there.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Football clubs are like families,
footballers are sensitive people. I’d like to bring a little warmth into
the set-up…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: “That type of operation?” I presume you’re
referring to Don Revie..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I am..</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: ..who has long been regarded as a father
figure in Leeds. And now you’re coming in as the outsider, the enemy
even, after all the things you’ve said in public, coming in and taking
ouver as STEPfather.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Don’t you expect some degree of resentment
to this?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I would accept and expect a strangeness,
initially, it’s perfectly normal. But it won’t be long before they
realise I’m a fair man. A kind man. And maybe under me they can
experience what it’s like to be in a happy family, after all.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: How can you be sure they weren’t happy
with Don all along?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They wouldn’t have played football that way
if they were happy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy gordon</strong>: Where have you been, boss?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Directors have been waiting more than an
hour. C’mon..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire weather! I
tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re five days late!! And did you really
need to say that about Majorca? You know he was Revie’s first choice for
getting your job.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who? Johnny Giles?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Club Captain. Don’s son and heir. His first
born. You’re never going to get any love from him.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Great. Here’s to happy fucking families.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: They’re waiting for you. Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: The Directors.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: For me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: For the board meeting.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of
tea?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yours, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Not mine. I didn’t put it there, did</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Mr. Revie’s.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Let’s get rid of it then, shall we? Chairs,
too. The whole bloody lot. Think it would be best if there were nothing
of his left here.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I was. For thirteen happy years.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What’s your name, pet?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Jean, Sir. Jean Reid.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: In which case, no offence duck, but there’s
nothing I want typed on paper from you other than your resignation.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Come in, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? No one going to offer me a drink? Like
an undertakers in here.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: The interview. For Yorkshire TV.</p>
<p><strong>cussin</strong>: We’ve had a phone-call.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: Not so much a phone-call. Bloody tirade.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: From Don. They only went and rung him. And
ran some of your quotes by him. About how unhappy the players were. What
“bad champions”. Looking for a response.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: Bloody got one, as well. He’s gone
berserk.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: He had it coming. He shouldn’t have done
that piece in the Mirror should he? Saying he thought I was a daft
choice.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: He’s entitled to his opinions.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And I’m entitled to mine.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: And I’m entitled to MINE.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Thank you. I’m the best old one, too.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: …I also did it under the assumption that
you’d be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of
Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and
Don?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Of course it’s just about me and Don. Always
has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders
of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big
white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won’t
sleep and won’t eat until I take whatever that man’s achieved and beaten
it – beaten it so I never have to hear the name “Don Fucking Revie”
again – beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale
houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian
Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: ..Ladies and Gentlemen, the draw
for the third round of the FA Cup will now commence..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: C’mon, Pete!</p>
<p><strong>white-haired elder</strong>: Number twenty-two..</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: Derby County, second division..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Here we go. That’s us..!</p>
<p><strong>white-haired elder</strong>: Number six..</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: the BLAZER-WEARING ELDER calls into the
microphone..</p>
<p><strong>blazer-wearing elder</strong>: Leeds United!</p>
<p><strong>radio commentator</strong>: Against mighty Leeds
United..!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Leeds..!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Fucking hell..!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Don Revie’s Leeds! Top of Division One! Here
we bloody come!</p>
<p>****: What do you say to that, Mr. Chairman?</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: I can hear the cash registers now!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Happy days, Sir. Happy days.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: You’re not wrong, Brian. Take the family
out for a meal. Go to The Mumtaz. Tell `em I’m paying.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Put the fish and chips in the bin. Tonight’s
on Uncle Sam. We’re going posh. Chicken fucking bhuna in town.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner and
Johnny Giles to be able to read</p>
<p><strong>that…</strong>: And this woodwork has seen better days..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Spick and span, understand? Wash these walls
down. Give the floors a proper polish.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I want it perfect. Like a fucking carpet.
We’ve got proper footballers coming. Who know how to keep the ball on
the deck.</p>
<p><strong>groundsman</strong>: Well, you can’t fucking train on it
then.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You know he’ll be making a file on us. A
dossier.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Don Revie. Prepares a file on every game.
Leaves nothing to chance. Knows every opponents formations. Strategies.
Everything.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ve heard he’s a superstitious twat. Ey..!
Help him, someone HELP him..!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We grew up just a few streets apart, you
know. In Middlesborough, close to Ayrsome Park. He’ll have known my
street, Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory,
where my dad worked.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Heard he wears the same suit to every game.
His “lucky blue suit”.</p>
<p><strong>18 con tinue d: 18</strong>: TAY LOR</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: The best manager in the country, Don Revie.
Played for Sunderland, like me, as a centre-forward, like me, and
England, like me.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon, give it and go!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Peas in a pod, me and Don. Two peas in a
fucking pod.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. manager’s office - baseball ground - day -
22</strong>: CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of
vintage red wine from a cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’re here! Well, almost..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’ve run out of petrol.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, it’s that superstition, isn’t it? Every
away cup ties, Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to meet you.
I’m Brian Clough.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Referee..!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Think, Alan! To feet!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now sent it out wide!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? He didn’t fucking touch him! Ref! He
DIVED! He fucking dived!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Didn’t say good-bye. Or pay me the respect
of staying for a drink. Couldn’t wait to get away.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bloody cheats and all. Neither of those
goals should have been allowed.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Just going to have to beat them, Pete. Beat
him it’s the last thing I do.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We need to get into the same division
first.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We need someone with a good head.
Experience.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I know. Our lot were like headless chickens
out there today.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: First thing Monday morning, I want you to go
and find me that player. A wise head.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Right. Better go and make myself known.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: All right, gentlemen, gather around,
please.</p>
<p><strong>27 con tinue d: 27</strong>: CLO UGH</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But you do, though, “Bites yer Legs”.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: People kick me, I kick them back.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Not with me as manager. Do that on my watch,
you’ll be fined and stuck in the reserves. Things are going to be a
little different around here. Without Don. Might feel a little strange
at first. Might pinch a little. Like a new pair of shoes. But if you
want your grandchildren to remember you for being something other than
the dirty buggers you all were, if you want to be loved as REAL
champions, WORTHY champions, you’re going to have to work. And improve.
And change. Now let’s start off by playing some seven-a-sides.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Don never did that.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, I’m not Don. And from now on I never
want to hear that man’s name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it,
or what he did or didn’t bloody do in the good ol’ days, will spend a
week cleaning my boots. Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and
sensible. No fifty-fifty’s.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fucking matter with you? He said no
fifty-fifty’s.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: What are you going to do about it? Book
me?</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: “Two hundred and fifty-one goals in two
hundred and seventy-four starts.”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ve got what you were looking for.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What about the petrol?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: In the boot of the car.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good lad.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Not now, love - please?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But it might be Pete.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Of course it’s Pete.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But it might be important. C’mon, eat your
carrots. For your Mother.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You asked me to find a player with a good
head. Experience. I’ve found one! He’s perfect. Dave Mackay.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Dave Mackay?!? He’s a hundred and fucking
fifty.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I admit he’s not young.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Not young? He’s old as fucking time!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But he’s clever, keeps the ball well. And
passes it better than anyone alive.</p>
<p><strong>lilian</strong>: Pete…! That’s enough! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He’s the one, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Never been more sure of anything in my
life.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: All right, I’ll talk to Longson in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We haven’t got until morning. Hearts have
already made him an offer. Want him as their manager. Apparently they’ve
already agreed terms.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, what did you fucking call me for
then?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the
deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Meaning he hasn’t signed.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: All right, Brian. Enough. Come back
now..</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Brian..? Love..?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Where would we play him?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: In the middle of the park. Somewhere he can
see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We’ll play him as a sweeper, then.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Won’t have to run about too much. And what’s
all this I hear about a tie shop?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He’s got a tie shop, hasn’t he? In London.
Which he spends two days a week at.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fucking tie shop?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s his “nest egg”. For the future.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No one’s going to be wearing fucking ties in
twenty years time.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You know it’s illegal. To sign someone on
the sabbath.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Is it? Then perhaps we should just shake on
it today? And sign tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? And let Hearts in again in the
morning? Fuck off. I’m not leaving here without a signature.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey, you would never have FOUND him if it
weren’t for me.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good job we’re both wearing ties.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Who the bloody hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: My name’s Brian Clough, and I once had the
pleasure of playing for England against you in an Under-23 match.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: I remember you now. You had a black eye, a
right bloody shiner. And never stopped fucking talking! What are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Come to talk to you about the Promised Land,
Dave. Land of Milk and Honey. It’s a little place up the M1 called
Derby. May we come in?</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: Dave Mackay??</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You don’t look happy, Uncle Sam.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: I’m not. What were you thinking? Going
over my head like that? Why didn’t you call?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because you’d have said `no’.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: Bloody right I’d have said `no’. The
man’s bloody crocked.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Pete reckons he’s good for three more
years.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: Is he fuck. He’s broken more bones than
Evel Knievel.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Trust me, Mr. Chairman. It’s money well
spent.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: And who the FUCK are they?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: That’d be Messrs. McGovern and O’Hare.</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern/o’hare</strong>: Afternoon/Hello!</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: Where did they come from?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: My old stomping grounds. Hartlepools and
Sunderland. Very reasonable, too.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: That’d be MY club, Brian. MY club.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You’re a genius, Pete. Bloody genius. How
did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern in
midfield, Mackay at the back, O’Hare up front. The skewer isn’t it? In
the shish kebab.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s beautiful. A thing of fucking
beauty!!</p>
<p><strong>caption: `bury’</strong>: GOAL!! Derby score. CLOUGH and
TAYLOR leap to their feet.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: “Love and marriage, love and marriage, it’s
an institute you can’t disparage..”</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: …“the man’s crocked”, “older than time”
“broken more bones than Evel Knievel?”</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: All right, I admit it, I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: a live awards presentation. From London. DON
REVIE is being presented with an award…</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: ..for Leeds to win the First Division title,
and for me to be named as English Manager of the year…feels like a dream
come true…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You enjoy it, Don. Go home, put your feet up
and fucking enjoy it. There’s a good lad. Because we’ll be in the First
Division next season. And we’re going to have you!</p>
<p><strong>this</strong>: we fade in the sound of roaring…</p>
<p><strong>archive tv footage</strong>: Wembley Stadium on Charity
Shield day. The opening of the 1974/5 season.</p>
<p><strong>commentator’s voice</strong>: The twin towers of Wembley
Stadium, the cathedral of English football on a glorious late-summer’s
day… good afternoon everyone, it’s the Charity Shield, the opening
Saturday of the 1974 season, and a first chance to get a look at Brian
Clough’s Leeds…</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: Will you be supporting Leeds today,
Don?</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: You’d expect nothing less having been their
manager for 13 years. But the fact is I’m here today as manager of
England…</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: Do you have any advice to give your
successor, Brian Clough, before his first game?</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Win. The people of Leeds are used to
winning.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Right, the team for today is: Harvey in
goal, Reaney, Cherry, Bremner, McQueen, Hunter, Lorimer, Clarke, Jordan,
Giles, Gray.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Of course, it goes without saying I’d like
you to continue as Club Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Never got it.</p>
<p><strong>50 ext. wembley stadium - day - 50</strong>: DON REVIE sits
in the stadium watching as:</p>
<p><strong>archive footage</strong>: the National Anthem finishes. A
great ROAR goes up.</p>
<p><strong>commentator</strong>: Kevin Keegan goes to ground….rolling
around on the pitch….that almost looked like Johnny Giles’s fist made
contact with Kevin Keegan’s face…it was!…the referee’s pulled out his
book…now a fight has broken out!</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. pitch - day - 53</strong>: On the pitch: BREMNER and
KEEGAN have started fighting..</p>
<p><strong>commentator</strong>: Billy Bremner of Leeds and Kevin Keegan
of Liverpool have come to blows…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: For fuck’s sake..</p>
<p><strong>commentator</strong>: …the referee is talking to his
linesman..! He’s sending them off! The referee is sending off both
players..</p>
<p><strong>archive footage</strong>: Liverpool lift the CUP aloft.
Delirious cheering from their FANS…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because losing wasn’t enough, was it? You
only had to be the first Englishman to be sent off at Wembley.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Not fucking English.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: There I am making a big song and dance to
the media about our new approach. Our new attitude. Our new ethics. And
you turn the place into fucking Verdun. My CAPTAIN.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: You can’t do that! Mr. Revie always paid
all our fines.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well he’s not fucking here now, is he?</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: No, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Right, last time there was a whole division
between you and Leeds. Not now. Not today. Today we’re here as Second
Division champions, and equals with Leeds. John McGovern and Billy
Bremner, EQUALS. Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles, EQUALS. Alan Hinton and
Peter Lorimer, John O’Hare and Paul Madely. EQUALS. Now, c’mon, chins
up. Chests out. We can take this fucking lot.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. hotel/pub - derby - night - 61</strong>: CLOUGH and
TAYLOR in a deserted bar. Alone. A television plays in the corner. DON
REVIE’s face on TV…</p>
<p><strong>don revie</strong>: …obviously it’s a terrific achievement
for Derby, being promoted to the First Division, but the truth is Leeds
United have an unfortunate habit of reminding them just how far they
still have to go..</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Arrogant twat..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But he’s right. Five nothing. They made us
look like fools today. And what was John O’Hare doing? Letting Madeley
bully him like that.</p>
<p><strong>61 con tinue d: 61</strong>: CLO UGH</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yours.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: He was all over the place. Like the
Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball
player, a natural in midfield. Who’ll hold onto it. Keep possession.
We’re giving it away too easily.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Someone like Colin Todd.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Oooh, now you’re talking. Lovely pair of
feet.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ve heard he wants out of Sunderland, too.
They’re all jumping ship up there.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, go on then. Sign him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What? We can’t. Longson’s already told us.
Club’s in debt.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Bollocks to that. I’ve not brought us all
the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table, and be cannon
fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the man.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hang on, hang on, careful…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I’ll handle bloody Longson.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: A hundred and seventy grand?!? For Colin
fucking Todd?!?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd. The
best technical footballer in the country.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: A salary of three hundred quid a week?
You can’t pay a footballer that!!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: That’s the way things are going, Uncle Sam.
Football’s all about money now.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: I told you never to go over my head
again.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were
in the bloody West Indies.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: WindowS? You mean there were
others?!?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy.</p>
<p><strong>gemmell/hennessy</strong>: Afternoon!/Hello!</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: For fucks SAKE!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam. What
did you come into football for?</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: To support the football club in MY HOME
TOWN. The club I’ve supported ALL</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, I’m sure we all admire your
loyalty…</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: What I DIDN’T come into it for was to be
lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But the way I see it, there’s no point being
in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and
that’s all the people of Derby want. To see their team on top of the
tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it’s really their interest you
have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director’s box, I
suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your
opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there’s a
good lad. Leave the running of this football club to the
professionals.</p>
<p><strong>uncle sam</strong>: But professionals DON’T run the club,
Brian, the Chairman does. And if it’s true, that football is all about
money, and that’s the way it’s going, that’s suits us Chairmen just
fucking fine..because we’re the ones who’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: See they’ve driven all the way into the car
park this time.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s not a cup game, is it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You know what your job is today?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Yes, Boss. Stay in position. Keep the
shape. “Stop being the Wandering Jew”.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good lad. And enjoy it. You deserve to.
You’ve worked hard this week.</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: Be big. Be strong. Any chance I get, flatten
Paul fucking Madely.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good lad. He bullies you, you bully him
back. And near post for the corners we worked on.</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: Yes, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Understand what I want from you today,
son?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I should, Mr. Clough. It’s simple enough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Go on, let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: “To be Colin fucking Todd, the best technical
footballer in the country.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: There, how could you forget that? Now come
on.. Up and at `em!</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. touchline - day - 66</strong>: CLOUGH sits in his
dug-out. While JIMMY GORDON and TAYLOR are calling out instructions to
the Derby players on the pitch…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Congratulations, lads! Beautiful! That was
as perfect a half of terrible football as I’ve ever seen. The plan
you’ve obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat, so
you deserve a little celebration…</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: No, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Then why the fuck did you give it to their
most dangerous player, Johnny fucking Giles?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: I didn’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You want me to get the sack, Mr O’Hare?</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: No, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: That open goal? Looked like a deliberate
fucking miss to me. A miss to get your manager the sack.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: The amount of bloody money I paid for you, I
must have been out of my mind. You can’t even keep on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You’ve all done a terrific job of getting me
the sack. So I’m not letting you out of here for the second half, until
you’ve finished the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You can’t do that!!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Can’t I? Just you fucking watch me!!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeah….fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’s he gone now?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And..?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: 2-1!!!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who scored?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: O’Hare. A brace. Oh, Brian, you should have
seen his first. Turns Bremner inside out, nutmegs Madeley for good
measure. It was beautiful. You’d think he’d been born in Rio de Janeiro,
not Aber-bloody-deen..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They were just nervous. Shitting themselves.
You could tell.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re a bloody genius. I tell you what, Bri
- if we can beat this lot, we can go all the way.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Derby County winning the championship is a
victory for decency, for honesty and for football. Because they don’t
pull shirts, or nudge people in the back in the box.</p>
<p><strong>80 con tinue d: 80</strong>: CLO UGH</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: I haven’t personally heard Mr. Clough’s
comments, but they have been reported to me, and our solicitors are
looking into them. If I could offer Mr. Clough some advice …I think he’d
be better off keeping his opinions to himself…some of these allegations
against Leeds United and his fellow professionals are an absolute
disgrace…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Don Revie? Ooooh. Don’t mention that name to
me.</p>
<p><strong>david frost</strong>: It’s really like the other House of
Commons. You hate to mention him. Why?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I hate to mention him why? Because he’s a
very talented man and I don’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>david frost</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And er… it makes the game go round. Half the
country don’t like a Labour government. It just happens that the other
half do.</p>
<p><strong>david frost</strong>: Why don’t you want me to ask why you
don’t like him?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because I can’t tell you. It’s impossible.
We’d get closed down, David.</p>
<p><strong>john sadler</strong>: Brian, you’ve been called big-headed,
arrogant, brash, the lot -</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: By your profession, John, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john salder</strong>: Sure. And a whole of it right too.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And a whole lot of it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>john salder</strong>: Fine. I’ll concede that. So how would
you define your approach to management, apart from being brilliant?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good lad. Thank you for the compliment. It’s
very, very difficult when you get asked a question like that.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: You’ve achieved something here that most
managers struggle for years to achieve this. It’s come to you very
young. Are you surprised?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Suprised, David..but more than surprised,
delighted. It’s nice isn’t it. For the good guys to win for once.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Which for you was the most important match
to win and the best performance from your point of view…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Beating Leeds United, obviously. Always a
particular pleasure that.</p>
<p><strong>coleman</strong>: Brian, you’ve also done it on comparatively
small gates, which I know has niggled you a little bit during the
season.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Niggled me, David, it’s absolutely made me
blazing. To be honest, I know what I want to achieve, I know what the
people of Derby want us to achieve, but when you’ve got a chairman not
wanting to put his hand in his pocket…</p>
<p><strong>82 con tinue d: 82</strong>: CLO UGH</p>
<p><strong>parkinson</strong>: How do you react when someone says “Boss,
you’re doing it wrong?”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I say, “How do you think it should be done?”
We talk about it for twenty minutes, then we decide I was right.</p>
<p><strong>mohammed ali</strong>: ..the world knows who I am. The world
knows I talk a lot.</p>
<p><strong>82 con tinue d: 82</strong>: MOH AMMED ALI</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Are you going to stop it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No, I want to fight him!</p>
<p><strong>committee chairman</strong>: William Bremner, your conduct in
the Charity Shield match was deplorable and cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>committee chairman</strong>: We understand Leeds are taking
disciplinary action against you internally, however the Football
Association has to be seen to make an example. We have therefore decided
to impose a fine of five hundred pounds..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Thank you..</p>
<p><strong>committee chairman</strong>: …and a suspension until
September 30th…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? September 30th? That’s more than a
month? Thats six bloody weeks??</p>
<p><strong>committee chairman</strong>: I’ll make it seven if you carry
on with language like that..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: C’mon, double the fine. Treble it. Anything.
Don’t suspend him for that long. He’s my Captain. The best player I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I suppose you’ve heard!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: God…what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Suspended for eleven bloody games!!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I know. You’re buggered. Billy Bremner’s the
heart and soul of that team.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Plus Mike Jones and Eddie Gray are
injured.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Like I said. You’re buggered.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What do I do, Pete? I need new players. Tell
me who to buy.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Help me. C’mon, we’ll sort this place out
together. You and me. Turn it around.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s too late. I’d have helped you once. But
not now. Not after what was said. We’re on our own now. Each man for
himself. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Well, look who it is! Come to raid my
larder? Or just missing the place?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: McGovern and O’Hare. I’ve spoken to them on
the phone. They want to come and play for me.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Aye, and you can have `em. A hundred and
fifty thousand pound for the pair.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Cheeky sod! They’re not worth a penny more
than seventy.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: But you’re desperate now, aren’t you? Having
lost to Stoke and Birmingham.. All, right, since it’s you..I’ll knock
ten grand off.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Give you a hundred grand.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: One thirty. Final offer.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: All right. Done.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Two wins from two. What’s not to enjoy?
You?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Loving it. Different class, Leeds. Proper
club. BIG club.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Demand results there, though, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Hey, it’s `Boss’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I bought you when you were crocked, you fat
bastard. And gave you the two best years of your career. It will always
be `Boss’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Exorcise the bloody place. Get rid of
me.</p>
<p><strong>mackay</strong>: Why? You’re not here anymore, are you? Be a
waste of a perfectly good desk.</p>
<p><strong>90 ext. motorway - day - 90</strong>: CLOUGH driving his car.
Clenching the steering wheel in fury.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fucking Scot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: McGovern and O’Hare? Can’t believe he
actually sold them to you. It must be true, then..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The rumour that he’s after buying Duncan
Mackenzie. It’s why he needs the money.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who’s Duncan Mackenzie?</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: the sound of a ringing phone…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Is that Duncan Mackenzie?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes. This is he.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Now listen to me. You go get your coat and
your skates on because you’re coming to meet me at the Victoria Hotel in
Sheffield in half and hour. And Duncan?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Bring a bloody pen, because you’re signing
for Leeds United today.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Congratulations, lads!! My first signings
for Leeds. My Leeds United. Playing with flair and winning with honour.
Winning the `right’ way. And winning the admiration of fans all over
Europe because…</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Because of the way we play.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because of the way we play!!!</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern/o’hare</strong>: Yes, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And you, Mr. Mackenzie, you scored
twenty-eight goals last season. You’ll score me twenty-nine goals
this.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Do you know how many goals I scored before I
got injured?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Clough. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Two hundred and fifty-one.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Clough, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Have a guess. Go on…</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Three hundred?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Two hundred and seventy-four! Now what do
you think about that?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Is that a record, Mr. Clough?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: `Course it’s a bloody record.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie/o’hare</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough/Yes, Boss</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Need to know what they say about me. Who’s
making trouble. Who the ringleaders are.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Want you to help me clear this place out.
Make it MY team, understand. OUR team. Clean it up and clear it out once
and for all.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Now c’mon, drink up. We’re off to meet the
press.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And Duncan..?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s “Boss” from now on. There’s a good
lad.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: they are being watched from a
distance by several Leeds SENIOR players..</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: What the hell did you buy them for? Waste
of bloody money.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Duncan Mackenzie scored twenty-eight goals
last season. John O’Hare and John McGovern are both internationals.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: We’ve got two strikers, Alan Clarke and Mick
Jones, they’re internationals, too.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And one’s injured and the other’s fucking
suspended.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Maybe if you spent a little more time here
on the training ground with us, you wouldn’t need to buy Derby
“rejects”. We’ve a game Saturday. Against Queens Park Rangers. Or had
you forgotten?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I haven’t forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: Well, you haven’t told us a single thing
about how QPR will play. Mr Revie would have files and dossiers
prepared. Had the reserves playing the Rangers way all week. Had the
first team looking out for this and that.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Bollocks to Mr. Revie! You’re professional
footballers. Stop Stan Bowles! That’s all you need to know about QPR.
And I don’t have to justify myself to you. Not how or when I conduct
training. Not who I buy or pick to play.</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: No. Not to us. But come Saturday afternoon,
there’ll be 40,000 people here who you DO have to justify yourself,
to.</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: a large RRRRROOOAAARRRR. GOAL.</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: “QPR 1, Leeds 0.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Sorry, lads.</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: the sound of a ringing telephone. A gruff
VOICE answers..</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You must be loving this. Loving every
minute.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Watching it all fall apart. It’s Brian
Clough.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They won’t play for me. Your boys. Your
bastard sons. And never will.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Are you drunk, man? It’s two in the morning.
What do you want? Why are you ringing me here?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They’re loyal to you. Thought you’d like to
know that. Loyal to Big Daddy Don..</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: For God’s sake go to sleep. Where’s you
dignity, man? And don’t call here again.</p>
<p><strong>harvey, reaney, cherry, bremner, hunter, lormier,
clarke,</strong>: JORDAN, GILES, GRAY walk towards the Derby
dressing-rooms..</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Get me today’s team sheet, will you?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What’s up, Uncle Sam? Bit below stairs for
you here, isn’t it? Taken a wrong turn somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Just seen the team sheet. Hinton, O’Hare,
Todd, Mackay. That’s our strongest side.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Of course it’s our strongest side. It’s
Leeds United. Would you prefer I sent out the apprentices?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: We’re at Juventus mid-week. Semi-final of
the European Cup. Biggest night in the club’s history!! Couldn’t you
just field…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Y’know…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: A weaker side? Am I hearing right? Is the
CHAIRMAN of this football club seriously asking his manager to LOSE?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: You know what I mean..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Against their biggest rivals?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: The Chairman of this football club is
asking his manager to be pragmatic. Manage his resources. Prioritise.
We’ve embarked on a huge program of refurbishment and improvements. New
stands. Better floodlights. We need a good run in Europe to pay for
it.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear a word of
this.</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: We’ve still got twenty minutes before
kick-off. I’d reconsider if I were you. I wouldn’t want my employer to
be unhappy..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: My employer?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Chairman of Derby County. And Chairman LONG
before you ever showed up.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: That’s right. You were Chairman of Derby
County before I came here. I remember that. When Derby County were at
the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them
for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full
stop. And that’s where you’d still fucking be if it wasn’t for me; at
the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and
nobody had heard of you. There would BE no Derby County without me, no
league title, no Champions of England; not without Brian Clough.</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: I’m going to give you some good advice,
Brian Clough.</p>
<p><strong>102 con tinue d: 102</strong>: LON GSON</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What have you done now?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You’re a bloody disgrace! You should be in
the book for that, Cherry!</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Good luck in Europe..</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: You fucking idiot.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: There’s Dad, look!</p>
<p><strong>son</strong>: Wait..! Look..!</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: CLOUGH is in the tunnel. Speaking to a
television</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Disappointed? Not a bit. My players were
heroic out there tonight. Effectively we were playing the Italian
champions with a reserve team. That many of our first team are
injured…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: …it’s what happens if you have a Chairman
who authorizes a multi- million pound refurbishment of the director’s
box and hospitality suites before he pays for a proper squad. Suppose it
depends on your priorities. Players or prawn sandwiches? I know which
I’d prefer. I know which honest, working class Derby supporters would
prefer, too..</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Billy Bremner, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who else?</p>

<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Eddie Gray.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Peter Lorimer.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: That you’re never here. That they’re
worried about the future. That you’re just going to fill the place with
more Derby players.</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: And that all thing’s considered they were
all a lot happier under…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Under who?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Yes, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: That he’s the boss? The Guvnor? The Capi di
Tutti Fucking Capi?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: Yes, Boss.</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: And that they miss the bingo.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: The bingo?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: And the carpet bowls.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Carpet bloody bowls?</p>
<p><strong>mcgovern</strong>: It helps them relax before a game.</p>
<p><strong>o’hare</strong>: That it, Boss? Can we go now?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Club cars. Complimentary for the senior
payers. Brand new.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Nice to meet you, pet. Now, you can take
your lovely sports cars, and put `em back on your transporter..</p>
<p><strong>representative</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: What are you talking about? These are
ours!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You’ll have complimentary cars when you
deserve a compliment. Right now you don’t deserve a complimentary
bicycle between you.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What are you doing here? Aren’t you
supposed to be in that hotel in Leeds?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I couldn’t stand it for another night.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What? So you drove all the way? What time
will you have to get up in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Half five.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Forgotten what a woman smells like.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Not like bloody men. That’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You still awake? You should be asleep.</p>
<p><strong>nigel</strong>: Tell us a joke, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: A joke? All right. There’s this bloke
walking about in London, when all of a sudden, the city gets hit by a
Russian `A’ bomb. Booooooooom.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The Chairman wants to see you. Said it was
important. Right away.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: About bloody time.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Where you been? I was about to send out a
search party.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Look, Mr. Cussins, I know it’s not been the
best of starts, but in my defence, there are a couple of things I’d like
to say…</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: This is Martin Hughes. He runs Mercedes
here in the North.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: We hear that’s what you like to drive. A
Mercedes?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s..what I used to drive at Derby.
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Well, we can’t have Leeds United being
outdone by Derby County, can we? So Martin here is going to take you
over to his showroom and get you sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: Never come between a footballer and his
motor!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: Especially not Billy bloody Bremner.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Is that it, then?</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Why? You look white as a ghost, man.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Heart attack, eh?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Had it three weeks ago, they reckon.</p>
<p><strong>118 con tinue d: 118</strong>: TAY LOR</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We have. Longson’s tried to put a gagging
order on me, of course. “Any further utterances in public or appearances
in the media by Brian Clough will be met with instant dismissal.”</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, I hope you take notice. And act
accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Would you like to hear my contrite
reply?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t want to resign.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No. Nor do I. Don’t worry, they’ll never let
us. We just won them the championship. But it will strengthen our
position and force them to get rid of Longson.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What? Oh, no, Brian. They’ll never do THAT.
He’s Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I can’t do it, Pete. I can’t work with my
hands tied, a Chairman telling me what I can or cannot do.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re picking the wrong enemy. The enemy’s
not Longson. It’s Revie. And your obsession with Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Don’t be daft. We won the league, Pete.
We’re top dogs in Derby now. And Longson can’t stand it. That’s the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s YOU. This monster in you.
This mad ambition. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s good…a fire, that
stirs everything up, and then there’s this…this thing that takes you
over…and destroys everything that is good in your life.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What are you doing? You weren’t supposed to
accept our resignations.</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: `Shouldn’t bloody well offer them,
then.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I only did because of HIM! You can’t get rid
of us. It’d be a disaster for the club. For the whole of Derby.</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: You can’t keep shooting your mouth off the
way you have been…or issuing these ultimatums..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You can’t do this! It’s madness!</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: The decision stands. And don’t even think
of a settlement. You’re getting nowt.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We’re going to create a footballing dynasty
here. Derby could be one of the greats alongside United, Liverpool,
Leeds..</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Car keys on the table and out!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Does none of you have the guts to stop
this?</p>
<p><strong>longson</strong>: Now! And don’t show your faces here
again!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: “To the directors of Derby County Football
Club. We, the undersigned players, are unanimous in our support and
respect for Mr. Clough and Mr. Taylor and ask that they be reinstated as
manager and assistant manager of the club.”</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But not Dave Mackay.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? Dave MACKAY?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s in the evening paper.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I signed that fat fuck - saved his
professional life. Gave him two more years as a player, as my captain.
Dave Mackay? He wouldn’t fucking DARE!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why did you do it? I love this place, Brian.
I’m happy here. So are you.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s not over yet, Pete. The lawyers are
issuing a writ tomorrow. Against Longson. The players are calling a
meeting. There’s talk of them coming out on strike. There’s protest
marches scheduled for this week-end.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why couldn’t you just have kept your mouth
shut? We’ll never find anywhere like this again.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Mike Bamber on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who’s Mike Bamber??</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Manager of Brighton and Hove Albion. Someone
who wants to offer us a job.</p>
<p><strong>over this</strong>: the sound of a referee’s whistle..</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Players Lounge, Brian. Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: This is the worst start to a season Leeds
has had in twenty years. Four points from five games? Second from
fucking bottom? What’s going on? As far as I can I see, there’s no
relationship, no understanding between players and management. Not a
healthy one, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Perhaps if Mr. Clough were to step outside,
we would all feel a little more like speaking our minds.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You bastard.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: All right. If you wouldn’t mind, Brian?
Just for a minute or two?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: No one likes him. The atmosphere in the
dressing-room is non-existent. We’re not allowed to mention Mr. Revie’s
name…</p>
<p><strong>giles</strong>: He’s banned us from doing all the things we
used to do…like playing bingo and carpet bowls…</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: Tactically, he’s never prepared, never
tells us how he wants us to play…</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: You know he’s just itching to bring in a
whole lot of new players..</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: The last two words of every story ever
written is what’s going on. “The fucking end.”</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: What I want to know is why, after all the
thing he’s said about us, did you appoint him in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I’m about to go home and work out how much I
want in severance pay. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure your job is safe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m not staying here without you. No bloody
way.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Then I suggest you go home and do the
same.</p>
<p><strong>bremner</strong>: What me and the lads are trying to say,
Mr. Cussins, is that compared to Mr. Revie - he’s just not good
enough…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: a dagger in his heart..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: “Oh, I don’t like to be beside the
seaside..”</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon, just give it a chance.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Brighton and Hove Albion? Have you seen
where they are? Bottom of the third division.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And we can get them out of there. Like that.
We did it with Hartlepools. We did it with Derby.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We cared about Hartlepools and Derby. We’re
from the North, Pete. What do we care about Brighton? Bloody
Southerners. Look where we are. We’re almost in France.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey, they’ve got money, this lot. And
ambition. And get a lungful of that air. It’d be good for my health.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You can’t manage a team that’s not your own
people. Not what you know. Anyway the Protest Movement in Derby is still
in full flow. We could still get our jobs back.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, we won’t. It’s over, Brian. They’ll
never take us back. Not now.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What about proper clubs? Like Manchester
United? Or Spurs? Or England, now Alf’s gone. Wouldn’t you fancy
that?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No one’s rung, have they? You’ve scared them
all off.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s only been a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: C’mon. Just listen to them? Please? For
me?</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: Sign today, I’ll give you a bonus of seven
grand. Each.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Seven grand? Y’hear that, Brian?</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: Plus a salary that exceeds by twenty percent
what Derby were paying you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Very generous, Mike. Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But those are first division wages.</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: First division’s where I want this club to
be.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Are you sure you can afford it?</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: Are you sure you’re worth it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Cheeky sod.</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: Take as long as you like.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Two weeks. Somewhere hot. On you.</p>
<p><strong>bamber</strong>: I’ll even throw in the bloody trunks.</p>
<p><strong>this</strong>: we fade in the sound of classical Spanish
guitar..</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: You’re a hard man to find, Mr. Clough.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Who’s looking?</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: My name’s Keith Archer. Secretary of Leeds
United football club.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Then what are you doing here, Keith? Because
from what I’m reading in my paper, and from what I hear on the jungle
drums, you’ve got a bit of a problem at home with your manager flirting
with the England job.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s not flirting…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: `Ey, it says it right here.</p>
<p><strong>archer</strong>: He’s taken it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Bloody hell. But we HATE Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: It’s the top flight, Pete. The First
Division.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But we’ve given Brighton our word. And
they’ve paid us the money.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: We can pay BACK the money. Bollocks to
bloody Brighton. I’d go mad. We’d ALL go mad down there.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Please…give it a year. Give it a chance.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: A year? It’d be death. Death for us all.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Mike Bamber is a good man..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Oh, do me a favour..</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He had faith in us, offered us a job when no
one would.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: He offered us a job. And now someone else
has offered us a better one..and not just anyone. The best team in the
country. C’mon, Pete, you know what that means.. It’d be the Charity
Shield at Wembley in a months time. The European Cup after..</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes, but even if we won them it would always
be Revie’s achievements. HIS team..</p>
<p><strong>138 con tinue d: 138</strong>: TAY LOR</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What? And you’d sooner fester down there?
With all those fucking Tories? In that blue-rinse retirement home by the
sea?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes, Brighton is a small club..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fucking midgets.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But at least we’d be together, you and me.
We could build them up. Make them our own. Like we did with Hartlepools.
Like we did with Derby.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And then what? Bottle again as soon as it
comes to the big time. That’s always been the trouble with you, Pete. No
ambition.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And that’s the trouble with you. Too much
ambition. Too much greed. Too much everything.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You knock it, but it’s done you proud over
the years. My “ambition”. Without me - you’d still be stuck in Burton
Albion. On the arse of the footballing earth.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But without you I’d still have a job in
Derby. A job and a home that I love. Yes, Brian - you’re the shop
window, I’ll grant you that. The razzle and the bloody dazzle. But I’m
the goods at the back. And without me, without someone to save you from
yourself, you’re not just half.. …you’re nothing.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I’m nothing? I’m nothing?? Don’t make me
laugh? So what does that make you, Taylor? Something?? You’re half of
nothing!! Nothing’s parasite! A big fat pilot fish that FEEDS on
nothing!! A bloody nobody!! The forgotten man!! History’s fucking
afterthought!!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, let’s see, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Let’s be honest. It’s not working, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What’s not working? I haven’t been here five
minutes, so how can anything be working yet?</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Still…the players aren’t happy. We’re not
happy.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: So what do you want to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: If it’s not working, then we’ll have to
part company.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fine. It’ll cost you twenty-five grand.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: What? For six weeks work?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy
Gordon. And an agreement that Leeds United will pay both our income
taxes for the next three years.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: That’s bloody criminal.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No, what’s criminal, Mr. Cussins, is the way
you as Chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the
players. Your MANAGER. Going behind my back like that.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: I admit, that was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And you can throw in the Merc and all.</p>
<p><strong>bolton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Might be a bit flash for a man out of a job,
but the truth is, I’ve grown to like it.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Who the bloody hell do you think you
are?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Brian Clough. Brian Howard Clough.</p>
<p><strong>cussins</strong>: Aye. No danger of me forgetting THAT name
in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Just wanted to say, it’s not right. They
should have given you more time.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Good lad.</p>
<p><strong>mackenzie</strong>: Not just me that feels that way,
either.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: The sad thing is, it won’t work. You can’t
change a manager like a pair of socks. It’ll happen once, to me - and
never again.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Thanks for agreeing to this.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. yorkshire tv studios - day - 144</strong>: CLOUGH is
led into the studio, and onto the `Calender’ set, chatting to the SOUND
MAN.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: What’s this? We expecting guests?</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Five, four, three..</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Good evening. Tonight the football world
was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of
Leeds United. We’ll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the
man he replaced, who’s success he couldn’t emulate, Don Revie.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is
one of shock at finding myself here with Revie…</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: See? Not so easy to make accusations when
it’s to someone’s face…</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: …but in answer to your question, six weeks
is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope
Revie would get a lot longer time in his.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you consider it was possible to step
into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you?</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Being very, very honest, I think it was a
difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won’t call
him Clough because I won’t take him down like that..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: …I do feel he made it harder for himself than
he need have.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: How did I do that, Don?</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my
players were.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, you WERE dirty, Don!</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: That’s not true. The last four seasons, we’ve
topped the charts for entertaining football.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And before that, you also topped ALL the
disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to
the second Division.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: And in fact, you went on record and said
so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be
relegated.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And I was right.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Do you think that might have hurt your
chances of success when you then came to manage them?</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Of course it did! The things he said? Why,
man? Why did you take the job in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because I thought it was the best job in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Of course it was the best job in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I was taking over the League Champions.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: You were. You were taking over the best bunch
of players you’d ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And I fancied winning the league, and
winning Europe, and doing it better than you.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: There’s no way you COULD win it better.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: But that’s the only hope I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: I only lost four matches..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, I can only lose three.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And still play attractive, clean football.
Without cheating!</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: See, there he goes again..</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Listening to you, I am struck that this is
not just a business matter for you both. It’s more than that. It’s
personal. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, we’re very different people, Don and
I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I’m a warm man. An
idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is
different. There’s a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he’s not even
aware of it. But he’s a cold person.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: You don’t KNOW me!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: And that lack of warmth. That coldness was
there. Permeated the club when I arrived.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: I totally refute that. The atmosphere at
Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I
signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents.
Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning.
Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They would never have let me.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Did you try? You didn’t even try. I soaped
those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no
thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of
mad personal vendetta with me.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well are you surprised? What else was I
going to do?? After what you did…</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: C’mon, Don. You know exactly.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Never! Matter of principle! I always shake
the other manager’s hand!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You shook Peter Taylor’s hand, and my
trainer, Jimmy Gordon’s.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Then I probably didn’t see you!!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: No, you saw me Don. But considered me
beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did
every other club and every other manager in the country.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Never would I knowingly refuse to shake a
colleague’s hand. The truth is, I probably just didn’t know who you
were.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: “Didn’t know who I was!” Pull the other
one.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, you certainly know it NOW.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Oh, we ALL know it now. We know you as the
man who’s constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have
brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of
the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who
had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him
away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United,
a team that in ten years hasn’t finished outside the top four, and took
them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it’s fair to say we all
know who you are now.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: OK, gentlemen, we’re going to have to
leave it there..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Well, let’s see where we are in a year’s
time, Donald Revie.</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Dear oh dear..</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Let’s see where we both are in five!</p>
<p><strong>austin mitchell</strong>: That’s it for tonight’s show. I’d
like to thank Brian Clough and Don Revie for joining me…</p>
<p><strong>revie</strong>: Thank you, Austin.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Boys? Do you think your old man is a
fool?</p>
<p><strong>simon/nigel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: You’re wrong. He bloody is.</p>
<p><strong>nigel/simon</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Me, and all.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: They’ve kicked you out, already?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: They have.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So how long was that?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Forty-four days.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Don’t make this difficult for me, Pete…you
know why I’m here…and I won’t bloody grovel.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: “I apologize unreservedly for being a
twat”.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I apologize for being a twat.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: “Unreservedly.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Unreservedly…</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: “Because I can’t do it without you.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Because I can’t do it without you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: “I’m nothing without you.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I’m nothing without you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: “Please, please baby, take me back.”</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: Fuck off..!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’ll only fuck me up again, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: I love you, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I know. But it won’t stop you.</p>
<p><strong>clough</strong>: So? Would you sooner go through it all
without me?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Never.</p>
