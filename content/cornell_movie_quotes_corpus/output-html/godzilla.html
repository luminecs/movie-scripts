<p><strong>skipper</strong>: Captain. This is the bridge. We have an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: What’s going on? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What was that!?</p>
<p><strong>skipper</strong>: I can’t tell…</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
lifeboats…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …I’m singing in the rain, just singing in the
rain…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …“What a glorious feeling. I’m happy
again…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …“I’m laughing at clouds, so dark up
above…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …“The sun’s in my heart and I’m ready for
love…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …“Let the cloudy skies chase…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …“I’m singin’ in the mud, just scooping up my
worms…”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good day. I am here with permission…I have a,
a… Permit. How do you say permit?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Dr. Nick Topopolosis?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s Tatopoulos.</p>
<p><strong>terrington</strong>: The worm guy, right? Kyle Terrington,
U.S. State Department.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>terrington</strong>: You’ve been reassigned.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You can’t shut me down now! My research here’s
not finished!</p>
<p><strong>terrington</strong>: It is now.</p>
<p><strong>briefing officer</strong>: The Japanese consulate has been
calling and we’ve been getting pressure from the Americans.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What did you tell them?</p>
<p><strong>briefing officer</strong>: Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Are there any other survivors?</p>
<p><strong>briefing officer</strong>: Only one, Sir. He was very
lucky.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Get them out of there.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Ask him what happened.</p>
<p><strong>briefing officer</strong>: It’s no use. He’s been like this
since we fished him out of the ocean. Whatever happened to that tanker
put him in a complete state of shock.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What did you see, old man?</p>
<p><strong>old cook</strong>: Gojira…Gojira…</p>
<p><strong>second official</strong>: I have no idea what he is
saying.</p>
<p><strong>old cook</strong>: …Gojira!…Gojira!…GOJIRA!!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Dr. Niko Topopolosis?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s Tatopoulos.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Right. The worm guy. Can someone get
those people off the beach?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the
hell I’m doing here?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You didn’t answer my question. In fact, for
the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: We have a situation on our hands that
requires your particular expertise.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you know that you just interrupted a three
year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Yeah, you’re the worm guy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The radioactive contamination in that area
altered the earthworm’s DNA! You have any idea what that means?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: No, but I have the feeling I’m about to
find out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It means that due to a man made accident the
Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they
were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They’re enormous! A new species created by
man’s recklessness. That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you, I’m only a
biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Then you’re perfect. Here’s your
radioactive sample. Study it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What sample?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You’re standing on it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t see it. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t see it!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That was a footprint. I was standing inside a
footprint.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But there’s no animal in the world that can
make prints like that? Is there?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: We’re hoping you’re going to help us
figure that out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Somebody must have seen it.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: It happened so fast no one knew what
hit them ’til is was over.</p>
<p><strong>peters</strong>: Tape’s in. The French finally released
it.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: A tanker was attacked and sunk
yesterday near the French Polynesians. We think there’s a
connection.</p>
<p><strong>woman scientist</strong>: Is that the tape of the
witness?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hi. Nick Tatopoulos…</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Dr. Craven, have you met the worm guy?</p>
<p><strong>dr. craven</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>old cook</strong>: …Gojira…Gojira…Gojira…</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: What could have possibly done all that?</p>
<p><strong>old cook</strong>: …Gojira…Gojira…Gojira…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …American and Panamanian troops
quarantined off a section of the Panamanian jungle today amid
unconfirmed reports of a crashed Air Force jet…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Murray wants these copied to each field
producer…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: And I’m supposed to remind you to call him
on all of Caiman’s expense p.o.’s.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Speak of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Think I should ask him? I’m going to ask
him. You think I should? I will.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh girl…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Did you talk with Humphries?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: This is not the place…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Just tell me, did you talk with him?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: He said he’d consider it. It’s between you
and Rodriguez.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Are you serious? He’s going to consider me
for he job? What else did he say?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Why don’t I tell you over dinner tonight?
Your place.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mr. Caiman, you’re married.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: And you’re beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mr. Caiman…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Call me Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mr. Caiman, I’ve been doing extra research
for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I’ve never asked
for anything but this job is really important to me. I’m too old to be
an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: So have dinner with me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: It’s your choice.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl?
How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, I’m not married.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Really? A girlfriend then?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. Perhaps I work too much.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: You mean to tell me that there is no one who
holds a special place in your heart?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not for a long time, now.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Well, I think you’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, thank you. Is she always like this?</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I had to beat her off with a stick.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Who are they? Lieutenant, get those
people away from there.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: They are with me!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: CHARGEURES, property and casualty
insurance. We are preparing a report.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You’re fast.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That is our job.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Well your people are getting in the way
of my job.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Major, what do you think could have done
this?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Get your people out of there or I
will.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mind if I borrow this?</p>
<p><strong>peters</strong>: You okay, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, I’m…wait…I lost…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Are you looking for this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Jerry, why are we slowing down?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s heavy in the bunt.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: That was fast.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: The nets are full!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Then bring ’em in!</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: We can’t. She won’t budge!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: She’s going sternway!</p>
<p><strong>first mate</strong>: What the hell did we catch?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Cut us free! Cut the nets!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Cut the damned cables!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Major, we just got a report of a fishing
trawler going down. Exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67
longitude.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: What makes you think it’s related?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: The trawler was pulled under.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Jesus Christ! It’s only two hundred
miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we don’t even know what it
is.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of enormous
reptile the likes of which we haven’t seen since the age of prehistoric
dinosaurs.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: So where’s been hiding the last sixty million
years?</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: The depth and breath of the ocean floor has
barely been explored. His kind could have survived there completely
undetected.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What about the traces of radiation?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The radiation is not an anomaly, it’s the
clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost
dinosaur.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Don’t tell me why it’s not, tell me
what the hell it is.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What do we know? It was first sighted off the
French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of
nuclear tests over the last thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Hence the radiation.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: More than that. I believe this is a mutated
aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Like your earthworms?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes! We’re looking at a completely incipient
creature. The dawn of a new species. The first of its kind.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: My life sucks.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, please, your life doesn’t suck. His life
sucks.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: That’s cuz I’m married to you.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Shut up. How can you eat like that?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Big bites.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I can’t believe he put the moves on me.
After everything I’ve done for him.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He’s scum! As far as he’s concerned you’re
just a pair of breasts that talk.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: I like that image.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You know how I spent last weekend? Walking
his damned dog.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m telling you he’s dirt. He’s a douche bag,
gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks…</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Hey, hey! I’m eating here!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Audrey, you’re too damned nice, that’s your
problem. Nice gets you nothin’ in this town. You gotta be a killer to
get ahead, you know what I’m sayin’? I’m sorry, baby, but you just don’t
got what it takes.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Animal, you don’t think that’s true, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Nice guys finish last. First rule of the
jungle.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well, I can be tough if I want.</p>
<p><strong>animal &amp; lucy</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Turn that up, turn it up.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s Nick! I know that guy. I know him!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He
looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I’d like to thank you all for coming out on
this beautiful New York City day.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: When I came into office four years ago,
people didn’t think we could reduce crime and I did.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Yeah, he did.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: People didn’t think I could restore
order…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: …and I did. The city is a safer place
today…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What the hell….</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: I don’t give a crap about some war in a
country I can’t pronounce. That’s not a lead story. Find me a damned
story, will ya!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
walked by the window.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Did Romeo have a name?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Nick Tatopoulos.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: That why you dumped him?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No! I just couldn’t see myself with some
boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I
wanted to have some adventure, some fun…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: And now you live the glamorous life of
Caiman’s assistant. Life’s a bitch, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: How long where you and dis guy goin’
steady?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Nearly four years…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Four years. Girl, I’m surprised he didn’t ask
you to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: That’s the problem. He did.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Tell me that’s not another goddamned
parade.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: That’s ain’t no parade…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Victor, wait!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Victor, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Sergeant O’Neal, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Any word from the Mayor’s office?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: They’ve agreed to evacuate the city.
They’ve called out the National Guard and riot police are on alert.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Evacuate Manhattan? That’s over three million
people. Has that ever been done before?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Status report?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: We’ve lost sight of it, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You want to run that by me again?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: After the initial attack he
just…disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on the
line.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t understand. How can something that
large just disappear?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: We’re not sure. We’re scanning the area
now.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: He probably returned to the river. Just like
everywhere else we’ve been, we’re always one step behind.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I mean, look at it. It’s perfect. An island,
water on all sides. But like no other island in the world, this is a
place where he can easily hide. He’s in there someplace.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Channel eight caught it on film!</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …WNEW’s exclusive images of the creature
were taken less than a half hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Cameraman Victor “Animal” Palotti barely
survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage.</p>
<p><strong>co-workers</strong>: Way to go Animal! That’s my man!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Great stuff, Animal. Weren’t you scared?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Damned right, you crazy Wop!</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: People! We have to be completely relocated
to the New Jersey station before our 5:30 broadcast. Okay, Caiman, Devoe
and Animal, you’re on the helicopter. Everyone else we’ll see you in
Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all
right?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Audrey’s going to stay with us tonight.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Great. See ya then.</p>
<p><strong>field reporter</strong>: …military and government health
officials set up a command post on the New Jersey coast this
afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Caiman, wait. Take me with you.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’ve got something on this. I know a guy on
the inside with the military…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Not now. You got my bag?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You don’t understand, I can get us
information…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Listen, this is the time when the big boys
have to go to work, okay Honey?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: The bag?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Come on, Girl, we’ve gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …in what city officials are calling the
worst act of destruction since the World Trade Tower bombing…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …Police and the National Guard have
quarantined off over twenty square city blocks…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …hundreds of thousands have jammed the
streets in the largest evacuation in the history of the city. And many
people are not happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I don’t understand why we have to leave our
homes. It’s over already, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What are we running from? A big lizard? I’ve
got cockroaches in my building that could kick the crap out of it.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Please don’t push. People are getting shoved
down onto the tracks and the trains can’t leave…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Well this is great!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: If we’re wrong on this evacuation they’ll
string me up from the Liberty torch.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Who the hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s a contingent of building owners and
community business representatives.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I don’t have time for this nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Most of them are campaign contributors.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: I share your concerns. I want to get the city
back in business as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: CHARGURES Insurance. We represent nearly
thirteen percent of the buildings in your city.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: If you’ll excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We are very happy that you are in control
of this situation.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You can count on our emotional and
financial support.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Oh, well, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Hurry, we’re going to miss the Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Sorry, you gotta have a press ID
past this point.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: Don’t you watch t.v.?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Can we see your press pass, sir?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: I had one here on my bag. Where the hell did
I put it?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Your old sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey
at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what
happened down in Panama. There’s a story here. I know it. You got any
tape or glue?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I left my forgery kit back at the office.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What’s it to you?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Can I use some?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What do I get?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: The warm feeling of helping your fellow
man.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Five bucks.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>p.a. announcer</strong>: Please exit the station. For those
of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on Monroe
and 60th and at Bergenline and 72nd. Please exit the…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Wish me luck!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Audrey, I don’t think this is a very good
idea. Caiman finds out and he’ll have your job.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’m tired of waiting for someone else to
give me an opportunity, Luce. If there’s a story here I’m going to find
it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You call this coffee?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I call this America.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You’re telling me that in an election month
I’ve evacuated the entire city for nothing?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Do you realize what this evacuation will cost
the people of this city!?</p>
<p><strong>admiral phelps</strong>: We’re been monitoring the waters
around the island. As far as we can tell it hasn’t left the area.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: But you don’t know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: We think there’s a strong reason to
believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the
sequestered area.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: But you don’t know for sure!</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Mr. Mayor, if he’s not in one of those
buildings then we give the all clear. But not until we’ve checked each
building!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Sir, that may be more difficult
than we originally projected.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: More good news?!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: We’ve run into a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Lt. Anderson and his men found this
late this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>lt. anderson</strong>: We were checking the office building
above when we discovered the floor was gone.</p>
<p><strong>lt. anderson</strong>: When we learned he could burrow his
way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined
zone.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
island?</p>
<p><strong>lt. anderson</strong>: Only five, Sir. We’ve checked them
all. He hasn’t used any of them.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Have them sealed off.</p>
<p><strong>lt. anderson</strong>: And how should we do that, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Fill them with cement, brick them up,
put land mines in them, bombs, I don’t know, just make sure that
goddamned thing doesn’t leave the island!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You know, he’s not an enemy trying to evade
you. He’s just an animal.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the
best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them
out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: All we need to do is find out what it wants,
what it needs, and he’ll come to us.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>radio technician</strong>: Delta niner, what is convoy
position?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Command, we’re just entering the city.</p>
<p><strong>radio technician</strong>: Convoy ETA, five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: They find anything yet?</p>
<p><strong>repairman</strong>: It is good.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You said this was French Roast!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: More cream.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: I sure hope your plan works.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m kind of hoping the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Tres bizarre.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. Very clever.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s a lot of fish.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I need your radio.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sergeant O’Neal, the subway vents. We have to
shut them down…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …With the air pressure pushing up, he’ll never
smell the bait!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Get some men down into those air
vents. Shut ’em down!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We need to open all the manhole covers in the
area. Let the scent waft down.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Commence phase one. Let’s gas it!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Let ’em fly!</p>
<p><strong>young officer</strong>: Where’re you going? Nick!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Fire at will!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Fire at will. Fire at will.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: O’Neal, what the hell is going on
there!?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: He’s gone, Sir. Echo division’s in
pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>looter #1</strong>: Jimmy, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>looter #2</strong>: Wait. I want this. Help me!</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: We have him, locked on.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Then FIRE damn it!</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: That is a negative impact.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Negative impact!?! It’s the goddamned
Chrysler building, that’s what it is!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You said he was locked on!</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: The heat seekers can’t lock. He’s
colder than the buildings around him.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I think we got him.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Echo four, where is he!?</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot #4</strong>: I don’t know sir. He just
vanished.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot #4</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What the hell is the matter with you people?!
You caused more damage than that thing did!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: I can’t believe it. He did all this
and we did nothing to him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s not true. We fed him.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: While it may have looked like Beirut, it was
in fact, Manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute
force.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: The President today declared a state of
emergency and has issued disaster relief funds to New York City.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: …rumors continue to mount as to the
origin of this, perhaps, lost dinosaur…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: …having shut down the United Nations in
the evacuation, foreign diplomats are demanding an international
coalition be assembled to track the creature…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …Maintaining a total media blackout,
officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing
this creature…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s okay, I’ll get out here.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: Can I help you, young man?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do you have any home pregnancy tests?
Especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene
citrate.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: This is all we’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll take them all.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You must have quite some harem.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look,
wow, uh, how’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s good to see you, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So you made it.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re a reporter. That’s what you always
wanted to be, right? I’m happy for you. Really, I am.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, well…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: So, you still picking apart cockroaches?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, I’m into earthworms now. You wouldn’t be
interested. They’re real “boring” creatures. Very reliable, dependable,
no surprises…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re still mad at me, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You just left me without a phone call, a
letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I’m still a little
mad.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: That was eight years ago. Some people
change, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Most people don’t.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’m sorry you feel that way.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wait. I’m sorry. You’re right. Eight years is
a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Sure. I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: One, thing, though. Who’d you get
pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I still can’t believe it. How does a guy go
from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When you and I use to attend rallies in
college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can
actually effect change. I never lost my idealism.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: And exactly what changes are you trying to
effect?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I have this theory that we’re inadvertently
creating new species as a direct result of what we’ve done to
nature.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: And you think this creature is one of
them?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood
sample earlier this evening…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Blood sample? How close did you get to that
thing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I got pretty close.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What else do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, we know he eats fish, he’s of reptile
genus, he’s a burrower, he’s amphibious and…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: …he’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, obviously these tests weren’t designed
for this but fundamentally they’re looking for the same hormonal
patterns that would indicate pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I don’t get it. If it’s the first of its
kind, how can it be pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The ultimate expression of evolution, it
reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been
known to travel great distances for reproduction. That’s why he came to
New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he’s
nesting!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Nesting?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this
could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Forgive me but I’ve got to get this into the
lab, to confirm all this. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: …Gojira…Gojira…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Audrey? Audrey?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …which is why in this case “all the kings
horses and all the kings men” may not be able to put the big apple
together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That’s it. You owe me a breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: It’s good. It’s a real good piece. But how’d
you get a hold of this material?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Like you said, “Good guys finish last.”</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Murray, I need you to look at this tape.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Not now, Audrey, we’ve about to go live with
the morning report.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re going to want to include this. I’ve
got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: You do? Who’s story is this?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Mine!</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: Taisez-Vous.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: …Major Hicks, what makes you believe
another attempt to gun that creature down will work?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: General Anderson, the problem was the
terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion
of Central Park… We should be able to take him down.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Last time you didn’t even scratch it!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: That’s not true. Our worm guy, er, I
mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and
bled.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You see, all we need to do is get a
better shot at it with weapons that don’t rely on heat seeking…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation’s more
complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature
is either about to lay eggs or already has.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Are you trying to tell us there’s another
one of those things out there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t believe so.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Then how can it be pregnant? What is this,
the “virgin lizard?”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, it reproduces asexually. That’s why we
must find the nest. If we don’t, dozens will be born, each one capable
of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an
enormous population.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: So after we kill the creature we’ll
begin a search for the nest.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It may be too late by then. These eggs will
hatch very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: How could you possible know that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The fish. The fish we found down in the
subway. He’s not gathering all that food for himself. He’s preparing to
feed his young.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: They just promo-ed your spot. It’s coming on
right after this.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must act
quickly before this problem escalates.</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: You want to divide our efforts
based solely on a wild theory?</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: He’s come through for us before and if
he feels strongly…</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: Come through for you!? Major, your
campaign’s a disaster. You weren’t even able to to prevent this thing
from coming to Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>governor</strong>: Excuse me Gentlemen, but I think we should
see this.</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: How the hell did this get out?</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: From an old Japanese sailor’s song called
GODZILLA, a mythological sea dragon who attacked sailors, to our own
modern day terror. Today in my special report, who is this Godzilla,
where did he come from and why is he here?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re special report! I’m the one that
found that stupid song! That’s my special report, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: And it’s “Gojira” not Godzilla you
moron!</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: Merde!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Allez, allez!</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …a path can be traced back from Manhattan,
to Jamaica, back to Panama and all the way back to the French
Polynesians where nuclear testing has been going on for over twenty
years…</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …But why? Research team member Dr. Niko
Padopolus believes the creature is nesting, using Manhattan as ground
zero to cultivate his species…</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: You went to the press with
this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, I didn’t…I didn’t talk with anyone.</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: They mentioned you by name!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes…but I…</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: You gave them the tape?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No, it’s still in my tent. It’s…oh my God, she
took it.</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: Pack your stuff. You’re officially
off this project as of now.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He stole my report! That’s my report!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: We know, Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …and in this reporter’s opinion, “all the
kings horses and all the kings men”…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Caiman you suck!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: I’m sorry about all this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Make sure they find that nest before it’s too
late.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Bye worm guy.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What do you mean Murray’s not there? A
second ago you told me he was on the other line…</p>
<p><strong>cabby</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Newark airport.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You’re leaving? Why?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Is this cause of me? Because of the
story?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well what the hell did you think was going to
happen?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You never said it was off the record.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I shouldn’t have to, Audrey. You’re supposed
to be my friend. I trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I didn’t mean for it to turn out like this.
Look, I lied to you. I’m not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out
to New York I was so sure I’d make it. But I haven’t. That’s why I
needed this story so bad. I just couldn’t tell you I’m a failure.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So you thought that made it okay to steal my
tapes?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good luck in your new career. I think you
really have what it takes.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: …every shelter in the tri-state area has
been overflowing with displaced people. Tent cities have begun to spring
up all over the county…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Can I get you something?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Pernot, no ice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’ve met before.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh yeah, the insurance guy.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure
et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sounds like a big company.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s the French Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We have learned that your American friends
have decided not to look for the creature’s nest.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you sure? How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why are you telling this to me?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I need you to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why do you need that?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I need your trust if you’re to help me find
the nest.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, my bags. I’ve checked them in.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We, have already taken care of them.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Bon Chance!</p>
<p><strong>displaced person</strong>: No one tells us a Goddamned thing.
My family is getting soaked out here. We have no place else to go. We
just want to go back to our home.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How did you get all of this stuff into the
country?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: This is America. There is nothing you can
not buy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So why all the secrecy? Why aren’t you guys
working with the US military?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I am not permitted to speak of such
things.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You said you wanted my trust, then I need
yours.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you
understand that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It is my job to protect my country.
Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have
made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your talking about the nuclear testing in the
Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes. This testing done by my country left a
terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: They will set the trap at thirty
minutes to ten.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That is when we will go in.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We know how to get into the city. We just
do not know where to start looking.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we
first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to
it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: So you’re in?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the
French Foreign Legion.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Who the hell are all these people?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What? I just couldn’t just let them sleep in
the street.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Where’s Audrey?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of
you.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: All that “you gotta be vicious” stuff you
filled her head with.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Me!? You where the one…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Go in there. Talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Can you comment on the nest? How many
more of these things will there be?</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: That’s why I’m holding this
conference. To try and avoid a needless panic.</p>
<p><strong>general anderson</strong>: Contrary to some frivolous
reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any
eggs of the creature in the city.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Stupid idiots!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s all my fault. What have I done, Animal?
What have I become? Look at me. This isn’t me. I don’t do things like
this.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: You made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man
who ever really cared about me.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Didn’t you tell me he left for the
airport?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah. Why are you asking?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: I just saw him. He’s with a bunch of guys
who want to sneak into the city tonight.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: My God. He’s going after the nest.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you
got one.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Animal, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Look, you want to make it up to your friend?
Well if he’s right, this is your chance.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve already made such a mess
of things…</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Audrey, I’m going after them. You can come
with me or not.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Lucy’d kill me if she knew.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s with the chewing gum?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Makes us look more American.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just let me do all the talking.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: It’s the maintenance entrance. Runs along
the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a
piece about it.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Who you boys with?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, we’re with the three two.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I didn’t ask you, soldier.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sergeant O’Neal just called down for us to
join in.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You got a problem talkin’?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why no sir, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: All right, keep it moving.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Elvis Presley movies. He was the King!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Be careful with that.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They’ve turned off the ventilation system.
They’re calling him to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Let’s hope we are not the hors
d’oeuvres.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: They’re down there. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Animal, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Shoot! Shoot it!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I guess we go this way.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Sergeant, status?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Any sign of it?</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Got him. Section 5, heading north to
target.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Don’t fire until he’s cleared the
buildings and has moved into the park.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Come on, come on!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What is up there?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Prepare to fire!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Damn it! Fire! Shoot it before it gets
away!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Fire at will! Fire at will!</p>
<p><strong>admiral johnston</strong>: Don’t worry. The Navy has a little
something there waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: We’ve got him on sonar. Arizona closing
in.</p>
<p><strong>radio voices</strong>: …Indiana, closing in…Calvin Coolidge,
closing in…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Jean-Claude.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Three eggs. I thought there would be more.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You were right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That can’t be. That’s got to be over twenty
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Okay, where’d they go from here?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Start counting.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: They must have climbed all the way up into
there.</p>
<p><strong>admiral johnston</strong>: They’ve surrounded the target just
at the mouth of the Hudson river.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Are we locked on?</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Locked on, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>ensign #2</strong>: He’s shifted course. He’s heading right
at us!</p>
<p><strong>calvin’s captain</strong>: Full stern!</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: We’ve lost the Coolidge, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: He’s shifted course, Sir. He’s heading back
towards Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Full ahead. Close in and lock on.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Locked on, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Impact in eight seconds, seven, six…</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: …five, four, three…</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Direct hit!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: They got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: We do not have enough explosives.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Nick, we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I think we should leave now.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: One more second. This is fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Don’t you think we have enough?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Just be calm. Don’t startle them.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Everyone, outside! Now!</p>
<p><strong>r-man #2</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>r-man #3</strong>: One moment. I’ve almost got this.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Great. Now what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’ve got to lock them inside while we
can.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Contact the military and get them to send a
bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How do I do that?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: 555-7600. Tell them it’s a code dragonfly.
They should get you through.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: …all circuits are busy right now. Please
hang up and try again…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Do you have any idea what’s going on out
there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be
let back into the city.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: We’re sending divers into the river now
to retrieve the body.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: That thing’s dead. What the hell are we
waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>elsie</strong>: Major, if Nick is right, this could be our
last chance to do something about it. We have to search for the nest,
now.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Organize a search party. I want a
complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You don’t have the authority to do that.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Try and stop me.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What’d they say?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can’t get through. I don’t know what’s
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: …all circuits are busy right now…</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: We’ve secured the doors on both
levels.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Where’s Luc and Pierre?</p>
<p><strong>jean-claude</strong>: They didn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You
will have to go and get help!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: There’s got to be another way out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Think we can fit up in there?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Only one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is not good.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hate these things!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, it’s me!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They’re loose. They’re allover the main lobby.
I couldn’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s okay. I know her.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Hey! What gives?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No cameras.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I thought you said there’d only be a dozen
eggs.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Do you have a radio, a walkie-talkie?
Anything we can use to contact the outside.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What about the phones?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Circuits are overloaded.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I know a way. I know how you can get a
message out of here.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Come on, the broadcast booth is right over
here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Our network covers the Ranger games.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: The network is on an intranet. It’s a direct
feed into our computer system.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your station won’t have any easier time
contacting the military than I did.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: When you worked with them, did they monitor
the news broadcasts?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, they did.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: We’ll go live! We’ll broadcast from here.
Hopefully they’ll see it.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …Yes, the threat is over but the pain
continues…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: There’s no Ranger game on tonight.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …If you’re seeing this, Ed, please put us on
Live! This is urgent! I know this sounds crazy Ed but you have to do it.
Please, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I’m not putting you on live!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He’s not going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Oh yes he will.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Ed, you see that? They’ll be all over the
city if we don’t stop them!</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: …as our fears have been allayed thanks to
the dedicated work of our boys in uniform…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Are we on? Are we live?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We’re live from inside Madison Square Garden
where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beasts lair. Doctor, tell
us what is happening here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’ve discovered over two hundred eggs which
began hatching only moments ago.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: You better see this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If the military are listening, they must
immediately destroy this building before they can escape.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Oh my God! They’re coming!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: If those creatures escape and multiply, in a
very short time a new species will emerge. One that could replace us as
the dominant species of this planet.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: That’s correct, I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden. No I’m not drunk. Contact the news station. Tell
them we’re on the way.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Reporting live from Madison Square Garden,
this is Audrey Timmonds,</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks, Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: The good news is they got the message. The
bad news is we’ve got five and a half minutes to get out of the
building.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Okay, party’s over. Time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Anyone care to join me?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: In case I can’t later.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The escalators, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’m locking on now.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Go! Now!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Stallion 15, Fox 6.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Somehow I never thought your life was this
exciting.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’d be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Really? I’d like to find out.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Hey Man, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I could use a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ohhhhhhhh…..shit.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Running would be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up
Broadway.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: You’re crazy, go to the east side and take
the park avenue to the JFK.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: The JFK? In the rain!?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: What are you talking about? The east side is
always faster.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: But we can get to the west side faster.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Somebody make up your mind!</p>
<p><strong>audrey &amp; animal</strong>: Take central park!</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Better step on it Frenchie!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: What the hell….?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant o’neal</strong>: Command, Command, this Sergeant
O’Neal. He’s back!</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Captain Rogers, do we still have those
F-18’s in the air?</p>
<p><strong>rodgers</strong>: They’re heading back to base now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>major hicks</strong>: Turn ’em around.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: I think we lost him.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Anyone see him.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Gun it! Gun it!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>pilot #2</strong>: We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
2.</p>
<p><strong>pilot #3</strong>: Stallion 12, Fox 2.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: How did you discover the nest?
Dr. Tatopoulis, can you tell us what happened back there?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Sorry, guys, I’ve promised my story as an
exclusive to another reporter.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: We did it! We’ve got the exclusive! Way to
go, Audrey!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>caiman</strong>: I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work
for me.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: Audrey, did you take the tape out of the
camera?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where’s Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>animal</strong>: I couldn’t have just lost it?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Tell your friends I will send the tape
after I remove a few items from it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank
you for your help, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Wait. Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Who was that French guy, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, just some insurance guy.</p>
