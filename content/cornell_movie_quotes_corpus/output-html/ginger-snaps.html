<h1 id="ginger-snaps">ginger-snaps</h1>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger an’ I? Went for different. Big
time. There’s a light on in a basement window. We creep up to it,
crushing the tulip. borders on the way. The window is propped open with
a sneaker: it looks like somebody’s foot is caught in it. Music plays
inside-</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Brigitte. Quit dickin’ around. Jus’ do it.
Brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton ball in
rubbing alcohol. Without looking up from her TANK GIRL comic, Ginger
hauls her own shirt up to expose her navel. Brigitte swabs Ginger’s
navel with the wet cotton ball. Her eyes drift to Ginger’s chest, then
back to what she’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger’s ten months older than me. we’re
seriously tight. Share everything. Everything. Around them, many candles
burn. There’s a dead bolt on the door. An attached full bath. The floors
are thick with paranormal books. The walls are covered in images of
UFO’s and horror flicks. A framed photo of Kurt Cobain with Courtney
Love has a place of honor. There’s an old Polaroid of the girls at five
in Halloween costumes; Lill Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf. Ginger
is the wolf. Brigitte produces an enormous darning needle. It glints.
she levels it at Ginger’s navel, her hand shaking.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: .I can’t. Ginger gives Brigitte a look
over the top of her comic. Brigitte takes a deep breath, and lines the
needle up again. Brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure. The needle
pierces Ginger’s skin. Her stomach muscles flinch.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You said it wouldn’t hurt!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Jus’ hurry up! The needle has stopped moving
half-way through the skin.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Uh-oh . Brigitte wiggles the needle. Blood
wells up around it.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Um. I think it’s stuck. Oh man. There’s
blood… Ginger lowers her comic. she takes one look at the needle
half-.in, half-out of her belly button - and cracks up.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: snot funny, Ginger! Laughing her head off,
Ginger gives the needle a good tug from her end. The skin tugs with it,
resisting.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ali, gawd, gross. Ginger yanks the needle,
hard. This time it moves.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I got it, I got it. Ginger grits her teeth.
The needle begins a slow progress.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s goin’, it’s goin’- gimme the ring
Brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but knocks it to
the floor. Brigitte scrambles after it. Ginger yanks the needle.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee?! C’mon! Brigitte finds the ring and
hands it to Ginger. Ginger sets the ring on the end of the needle,
looping it not-so-neatly through.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh, groo-oo-o-ss! The bloody needle pops
clear. Ginger grinds on the ring to close it. Ginger wipes her bloody
hands on the bed. Brigitte is taking deep, gulping breaths.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee? Feeb. Y’okay?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah. I think so.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, I think not.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: If you din’t say it hurt, I’d a been fine!
Ginger beams at her new piercing.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Pretty cool, unh? The flesh around the navel
is hot pink and bruising. Brigitte grins too.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: very cool.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Now I’ll do you. Brigitte bravely hangs onto
to her smile.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: We do everything together. But, at
fifteen? A chick can change. Ya know?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Don’t get me wrong. It’s not like we were
all happy or nothin’ to begin with. Brigitte takes a long, ponderous
drag on her cigarette as - unmoved - she takes in Ginger’s mortal wound.
Brigitte eyes the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the
horizon.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The suburb of Bailey Downs? Basically a
well lit black hole. The Kingdom of cul du sac. That’s French for Dead
End. Brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves. It
smolders then goes out. She scowls.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You had a gram of personality out here?
Life bit the big one. A truck with COUNTY REGREENING PROGRAM on its side
pulls up a few houses over. Brigitte watches a shirtless sun-bronzed
Adonis - SAM – climb out of the cab.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Of course I’m generalizing. A tarty
teenage girl - TRINA - bounds up to Sam and gives him a big wet one.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: The fuck, Bee. Take a picture already.
Brigitte raises a 35mm still camera to her eye and frames her sister’s
corpse in the viewfinder.</p>
<p><strong>roll head credit sequence:</strong>: snap! A slide of Ginger
- dead on a white picket fence - smashes on. The HEAD CREDITS are
superimposed on each of the slide images: snap! Ginger sliced up with an
electric knife in the kitchen, Snap! Ginger drowned in a bubble bath,
Snap! Ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room, Snap! Ginger mangled
under the front tires of a mini van.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: We were always considered freaks. For as
long as I can remember, there was Us. And there was Them. Like from
kindergarten.</p>
<p><strong>art teacher</strong>: Very -um. Class? Comments? The students
trade constipated looks.</p>
<p><strong>art teacher</strong>: Brigitte. What does it mean for you?
Brigitte shrugs and squirms.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Means there’s more to life than – well,
li.fe. The Fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank faces.
Brigitte shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Attempts at communication wore futile.
JASON McCARDY- a good-looking high school Casanova - looks Ginger over
appraisingly. Ginger ignores him.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Some of Them did seem to wanna reach
Ginger? Brigitte glances from Ginger’s breasts to her own flat chest.
Brigitte takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: But nobody wanned to reach me. The bell
goes.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Like I cared.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Gawd, People! They hurt my brain!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They didn’t even get it.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They’re retards.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They’re cretins.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They’re bone-heads.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: ‘t’hey’ re somnambulists.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They’re leems.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They’re the goddamn walkin’-/ The girls
stop before their locker. A folded up piece of loose leaf has been
crushed into it, its end sticking out.</p>
<p>****: Another one? Ginger opens the locker. She unfolds the paper.
There’s a big fat joint inside, and a note that says: GINGER, CALL
555-</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Somebody leaves you all. these jays an,
yer not even curious to call?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No pe . A FAT JANITOR scoops up the wad of
loose leaf with great resentment and jams it into the trash. Brigitte
and Ginger pass a NECKING COUPLE practically dry- humping, GIRLS
applying make-up to one another, and BOYS snapping each other with their
sports cups. Jason and his fellow jock-pals TIM, FRANK, and JEREMY are
scoping babes. Ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan
swells from the guys.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: See? She’s weird, but hot.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Anybody poled Fitzy yet? Brigitte gives them a
disgusted look.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Not that one. The cute one. Brigitte’s face
falls. Ginger gives them a Death Stare. The boys try flirty smiles.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sad. Must be hard to think with yer brains
slappin’ around yer thighs like that all day. Brigitte laughs. Ginger
pulls her on, past a sign: GYMNASIUM.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: We didn’t do guys. Guys were too gross.
Everyone at Bailey High was just too incredibly gross. Ginger applies
her boot to a swinging door and they enter,</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The only thing worse than most teenage
boys are most teenage girls. Trinas are the limit. Ginger digs at her
lower abdomen painfully.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I feel sick.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No, J. mean really. Gingler opens a locker
and tears off her clothes. Other girls glance at her navel piercing with
disgust.. Brigitte is very self-conscious: she steps almost inside the
locker, hiding behind the door while she changes into the revolting
school gym outfit. She eyes the buxom bubble heads with contempt, as</p>
<p><strong>bri.gitte</strong>: There was really only one Trina, but they
were all the same. Trina finds the Fitzgeralds’ open locker door a
nuisance. She pushes it out of her way, hard enough to whack Brigitte in
the head on the other side.</p>
<p>****: Ooops. Sorry. Ginger gives Trina a very dirty look. Brigitte
tries to rub her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her
chest. Trina and her posse cackle as they prance out, their butt cheeks
waggling. The sisters continue changing.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Y’ okay’s</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I HATE her. Like to feed her ground glass
with tacks for desert. Then make her puke it back up and swallow it
again until she’s like shredded to a bazillion pieces from the inside
out… Ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte,</strong>: what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I got gas…Maybe I’ll try an, cut one right
in her face out there. They slap hands, laughing. They look down at
their gym outfits, which are SO unflattering. Brigitte and Ginger
exchange identical looks of agony.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: After two weeks a’ high school., ya come
to the conclusion it’s all about agony. Take Phys. Ed, sus’ practise
takin’ pain. The gym teacher. M7.,. SYKES - an aging former-traffic cop
- hucks the players sticks with nets on one end. Sykes is given to
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Field lacrosse is no pussy-assed tea party,
ya get IN there, get a LOCK on your target and PUSH IT! I want SWEAT I
want ACTION! The Trinas giggle at Sykes. Ginger bends forward, holding
her sides.</p>
<p><strong>mz.sykes</strong>: Shake a leg, Fitzgeralds. An, butt out,
you gotta death wish!?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Feel really sick, Mz. Sykes.</p>
<p><strong>mz. syres</strong>: Cigarettes’ll do that for you! Move!
Ginger flicks the smoke at Sykes’ turned back. It falls short, of
course. The sisters trudge to their places on the field. Ginger is on
the offensive line. Brigitte is in goal.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Phys. Ed. is not optional at Bailey High.
Sykes blows the whistle. A fast-moving, hard-hitting lacrosse scrimmage
begins.</p>
<p><strong>in rapid-fire montage</strong>: Ginger gets caught in the
crunch of sticks and bodies, pushed, kicked, and punished by the Trinas,
who are having ‘fun’.</p>
<p><strong>in rapid-fire montage</strong>: Brigitte visibly cowers as a
tangle of marauding, ball-whacking bodies descend on her. She takes a
number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball. on a powerful press for
a goal, Trina slams into Brigitte so hard Brigitte flies right out of
the net area. And skids face-first .into a mangled dog’s body. The
whistle blows and play stops. Ginger lopes over, breathless, gripping
her sore stomach.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I been waiting for this. There’d been a
lot of dead dogs around lately, but this was my personal first. Brigitte
slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her knees. She’s
covered in doggie guts and maggots.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Oh, HOW GRO-O-O-O-OSS!!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: ‘Kay, here’s the weird thing about me. I
dig dead stuff. Live things make me sick, they’re all warm and snotty
and shitty and pissy. And live things jus’ suffer, which I can’t take.
But a dead thing? S’kinda beautiful, ’cause a dead thing’s really I
dunno -like, free.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Don’t TOUCH it, Fitzgerald! What’s WRONG with
you two?! Get up and hit the SHOWERS!</p>
<p><strong>trinas in chorus</strong>: The cult? Drains the blood out and
drinks it, ya know! /1 heard they have sex with them first ! /Gawd stop,
you’ll make me PUKE!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Everyone was all like, Oh it’s a teen
cult, or aah, it’s some looney, the Beast a’ Bailey Downs. What
crap.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: All RIGHT, ladies, settle! This is no joke!
You have information about the dog deaths you do</p>
<p><strong>class in chorus</strong>: Tell a teacher, Principal Fardor,
or the police.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Teen cult my ass. Look Ginge’, something
went for its throat - it’s not cut, it’s chewed… Brigitte looks up in
time to see Ginger’s eyes roll back in her head. Ginger faints. The
class inhales as one.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger? Sykes and the class stampede up.
Sykes pushes Brigitte out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger’s no pussy. She doesn’t faint. I
might faint. Like, if this pooch were only HALF-dead, I could faint.
Brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass. She hugs herself.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: The fainting’ s worrisome you don’t diet do
you dear?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Hm. Anemia’s very common at your age. Eat
more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement. If it happens again,
straight to a proper doctor, all righty? Brigitte looks relieved.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Now as for ’the headache, cramps, lower back
pain .I’m guessing your period is due.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I haven’t got a, um, period.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Never? Flow old are you?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fifteen. our mother says we’re late
bloomers.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Well judging by your troubles, I’d say you
can expect to blossom any time now! Brigitte pulls a face. Ferry
produces numerous samples of feminine hygiene products and heaps them
onto Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Are you familiar with all these? Ginger
shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Now what suits one girl might not be
comfortable for another. The proper form of protection is a personal
choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which
naturally changes during the time you’ll have your little miracle of
nature. It could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward
basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish
slime, signaling the end of the flow. Twenty-eight days later or there
abouts, it’ll start all over again and continue every month until
menopause, in about thirty years’ time. Nurse Ferry produces a pocket
calendar with a tampon or pad advertisement for every month.</p>
<p><strong>ferry</strong>: Here’s a little calendar to keep track, count
from the day it starts twenty-eight days. That’ll be your next time. You
have any questions, come see me again. You too sweetheart, be your turn
shortly, I expect. Brigitte Looks horrified.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Here’s a dirty word. Inevitability. That
fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so
insulting. Ginger and Brigitte trudge homeward looking completely
depressed. Brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene calendar. Ginger
watches the pavement beneath her feet.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: “Some days it’s all you need.”-? What does
that mean?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: So you pulled a Quincy on that dog, unh?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Hunh? Ginger grabs the calendar and sticks
it in her pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable.
Alls I remember is you goin’, “Teen cult my ass”.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh. Right. Well, I dunno. Brigitte shrugs.
She gives Ginger a funny look.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Why are you looking at me like that? Do I
look - different?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Can you tell I’m going to-?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No. .Really. Ginger squints at her,
unconvinced.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wham. Total adultness. How can I have a
miracle of nature an, not be old enough to drive! fiurih? The fuck.
Ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard. Brigitte doesn’t have an
answer to this.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey. If I start simpin’ around tampon
dispensers and moanin’ over cramps, or even think about buying somethin’
that says Baby Powder Fresh? You’ll. shoot me, right? BR TG.’i”I’L of
course. They exchange grins.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Out by sixteen</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: .or dead in this scene. Ginger raises her
hand and Brigitte smacks it hard. As they mount the drive, Ginger picks
up a stone and hucks it at Norman, who’s still barking. She misses.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: If we failed to get a life by Ginger’s
sixteenth birthday? we were s’posed to gas ourselves in the garage. For
smart girls, we could be pretty dumb. we prob’ly never woulda done it,
but we seemed to need a deadline.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The nicest thing I could say about Henry
and Pamela was also the meanest thing I could say.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Didn’t you have a presentation? How’d it
go?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fine. Pamela and Henry exchange irritatingly
patient smiles.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They were easily satisfied. A rogue’s
gallery on the wall depicts Henry and Pamela’s transformation over the
years from angry young Ban The Bomb- types into middle-class
mundane.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Made an appointment for you girls at my
gynecologist. Next Thursday. Henry studies his plate. Ginger almost
imperceptibly shakes her head at Brigitte. Brigitte nods,
understanding.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: why.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: You know why.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: we’re not going to a gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What did I say about that tone of voice?
.You are going to the gynecologist.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Dad!? She’s completely paranoid!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’d rather stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: She’s gonna have some fat jerk get his
jollies poking his fingers up our ./</p>
<p>****: I’m actually eating here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Henry, neither one of them has had a period
yet.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Ah. Yes. You’ve said. Repeatedly. As Pamela
says the next line, Ginger mou t:hs it- word for word 1.a Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: It’s very odd that two perfectly healthy
fifteen year olds are not menstruating. Right? Briggitte apes Henry’s
next line back to Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Mmmm. steak’s really yummy tonight. This a
new sauce? The sisters giggle. Pamela is losing her cool.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I started at eleven. The problem must be on
your side, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Pamela? This is not my fault. No one’s at
fault here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: when did your sister start?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ve told you, I really have no idea. Oddly
enough, we never discussed it. why don’t you call her and ask her
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I can’t call her out of the blue and ask a
thing like that. Besides, it’s dinner time. They’ll be eating.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A–ha!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Well I’ve been checking panties for four
years now</p>
<p><strong>ginger &amp; brigitte/henry</strong>: Mo-othe-er!!! /For
chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You look at our underwear? Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, hey - I don’t want to hear that word in
my house. You will do as your mother says and I will change the subject.
Anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence? From under the
table, Henry produces the bloodied, sawed-off picket stained bloody from
Ginger’s impaling. Brigitte holds her full mouth open so Ginger can see
its masticated contents. Ginger cracks up laughing. Henry and Pamela
sigh.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Why din’t you jus’ tell her you’re going
to get it?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Can’t take her ‘attention’. She grosses me
out. Can’t believe she’s our mother. Brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her
nose and lifts a Polaroid camera at arms’ length from her face.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah, but now we have to see this doctor.
You can jus’ say you got it, but I’m screwed. FLASH! The Polaroid spits
out the front. Brigitte sticks another tampon in her free nostril, and
one in each ear as,</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Did I get you out of Home Ec? Did I get you
out of ballet classes? So I’ll get you out of this, right?</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: You better, gawd the idea FLASH!
Brigitte takes a Polaroid of herself with a tampon sticking out of every
visible orifice. Ginger slides the grass into a pre-rolled fresh casing
and sticks it in her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I said I will, I will. This jay’s fine. Let
us smoke, sister. Ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat. She
double- takes Brigitte’ s tampon face.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: WHAT are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Look - a walrus.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hardee-har. Har.</p>
<p><strong>ext a neighbor’s yard - night</strong>: Norman the terrier’s
incessant barking goes on in the distance. The moon is full tonight. A
plastic child’s playhouse sits in their next door neighbors’ back yard.
A cloud of blue smoke emanates from its doors and windows. There is an
occasional FLASH! from within, and the whir of the Polaroid’s motor.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: How’l1 you know when you finally get it
any ways?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Prob’ly feel like peein’ your pants.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Well I’m not too excited.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte,</strong>: We’re missing Unsolved Mysteries.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wish I was an unsolved mystery. Brigitte
reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey. You smell somethin’ gross?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This is so not my day. Brigitte helps her to
her feet. Ginger shakes what she slipped on off her shoe. It’s a long,
ropy intestine. She drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Nice. Dog shit.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: That isn’t shit… it’s death. A line of
blood and gore trails across the grass to a back lane. Brigitte follows
it. Ginger looks around for something on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Great. Lost the jay. Great.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ack, it’s still warm, gross. Brigitte
takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is strung around her
neck.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Why every dog but the mutt next door to
us?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Hey, we could take it home. Try like, an
autopsy. Like, crack the case!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Nah. Let’s put ’ im in there so he won’t.
Lraumatize the kiddies.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: We never do what I wanna do.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oh, c’ mon. Would stink up the whole room!
They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It’s hind end sticks
out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging it all the way in.
Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Nice. Ginger wipes at the blood with her
hand. More appears. She lifts up the hem of her skirt. Her face falls.
She looks around. She slips her fingers up to her crotch. Her hand comes
out bloody.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee. I JUST got the curse. Brigitte stops
rooting garbage over the dog.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Serious? Ginger wiggles her wet fingers at
her.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: We gotta go home.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Eeew, ’kay. Brigitte catches her kilt on a
nail sticking out of a plank in the trash. Something is crunching
through the leaves toward them. Ginger peers out into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hurry upt</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’m stuck3 A few homes down, a garage’s
motion-sensitive security lamp trips on. Ginger squints, blinded.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee?: Brigitte contorts to deal with the
nail. Brigitte tears her hem free and jumps down. The light snaps
off.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Let’s go this way. Brigitte dips a hand back
into the dumpster for the plank with the nail. Off Ginger’s look,
Brigitte shrugs. They start walking down the lane. The greenery behind
them starts swelling again. The leaves crunch, faster. Brigitte and
Ginger look at one another, and walk faster. The lane empties behind a
deserted strip mall.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: This is stupid. We’re getting farther from
home. Ginger is pissed off now. she turns to confront their stalker.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: All right you ass-/ She’s cut cold by a
roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth and claws: SOMETHING takes Ginger
down hard. We cannot see it as a whole, we can’t make out what it is.
It’s big, heavy, and raging. Immense jaws snap vicious teeth, going for
Ginger’s jugular. Brigitte drops her plank.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte/ginger!!!</strong>: Brigitte grabs and kicks at the
creature. Ginger raises her arms and covers her head, screeching and
kicking. The thing grabs Ginger by the scruff and shakes the living
daylights out of her.</p>
<p><strong>beeeeei help meee! beeeee!!!1!</strong>: Brigitte snatches up
the plank with the nails. Brigitte brings it down hard on the thing,
screaming. She smacks it once, twice. The plank pops a shot off the
camera: FLASH! A horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for
a split second in the light. The third hit evokes a yelp and the thing
backs off, snarling.. Brigitte quakes with the board raised, ready. The
thing skitters before her as she screams. Ginger scrambles to her foot
and grabs Bee with bloodied hands.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Go-go-go-go-go-go!!!! Brigitte drops the
plank and they run like hell.. for a main thorough-way ahead. It pursues
them.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger, shit! Ginger looks at herself.
Ginger starts to cry.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: The fuck was that, Bee?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I couldn’t remember Ginger crying, ever.
Brigitte flies out to,</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger, sshhh, don’t, ’kay. Don’t cry.
Carefully, Brigitte begins to dab at Ginger’s arms with it, wiping off
the blood. Ginger flinches. The damage is gradually revealed: massive
claw marks, deep scratches, and puncture wounds - BITE MARKS. Brigitte’s
eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Okay, this is really bad. You need a
doctor, Ginge’, I can’t stop all the -/</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No! Not tellin’ anybody! Bee?! Nobody. Get
in shit for bein’ out, smokin’ up - don’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What if you get, sick? What if these bites
get infected?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bce!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Fine! I won’t tell! Brigitte starts
tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on thick. Oblivious, Ginger
fumbles for a smoke. She can’t get the lighter to work.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wanted to kill me! I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I know, I know. I was so scared, I thought
you were -/</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Me too. Don’t say it. I know. Brigitte
lights her smoke for her. Ginger takes a drag and passes it back to
Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fuck. You okay? Brigitte resumes her first
aid.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Yeah, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Why!?? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: It was crazy, it was like rabid or
somethin’ – Shit, look at the size of these bites!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m okay, I’m okay, I’m okay. Right? It’s
okay. Brigitte doesn’t look convinced. Brigitte snaps the port of an
internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube. She withdraws a
sample-size of Jack Daniels.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Drink this. Ginger glugs some down, and
passes the last mouthful left to Brigit.t.e. Brigitte waves it. away,
-,o Ginger finishes it al.l.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I seen this thing, on bears? Said bears’d
come after like, chicks on the rag. ’Cause of the smell.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wasn’t my fault!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I didn’t say that…/</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wasn’t a f uckin’ bear either. Whatever it
was, it wasn’t a bear!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I know, I’m not /</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Do I stink? Can you smell it?</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: No! Geez, I was jus’, whatever. A heavy
silence falls between them. Brigitte keeps working.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Doesn’t feel anythin’ like peeing your
pants, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: It doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s gross though. It’s really gross. I
better, ya know, deal with that…</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah, sure. Ginger’s only half-bandaged
up. she staggers to the bathroom and shuts the door. Brigitte eyes the
Polaroid camera: a picture sits ready to be dispensed. She pulls it
free. We do not see the photo. Brigitte’s eyes bug out as she examines
it. The toilet flushes in the bathroom and Brigitte pushes the photo
under the pillow on her bed. Shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: It was blurry. It was really outta focus,
so. Ya couldn’t TELL it was really anything. Ginger emerges pulling
uncomfortably at her crotch. she climbs painfully onto her bed, and
collapses.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: That booze - straight to my head, man.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You really okay? Ginger-es eyes are
already fluttering shut.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You saved me. Love you. Bee. Brigitte leans
in, listening to Ginger breathe.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Me too, Ginge’.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I woke up later, I thought the thing was
in our room. Brigitte peers at Ginger: she’s snoring. Brigitte pulls out
the Polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by. This time we see it
too. A streak of fur, fangs and a golden glinting eye.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Then I remembered Sam the tree planter
killed it with his truck, an’ we were okay. .But really, Ginger -? well.
Wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Gonna eat that? Ginger shakes her head as
she picks at her bandages. Brigitte helps herself.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Mmm! Sad, but Pamela’s egg salad is her
best thing. Like that she can do. Like, when she puts the baby onions
in? And she gobs on it and adds those hard little pieces of</p>
<p><strong>booger</strong>: Ginger pulls at her own crotch.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Hell-o 1?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sorry. Pads suck, so ya know.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Should eat something.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Thanks Pamela, I’m aware. Off Brigitte’s
insulted look,</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: T dunno, I’m all blaaahh, I got this, like I
can taste what I want, but nothin’s it. Ya know? Brigitte stops in
mid-chew.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: A craving?</p>
<p><strong>gincer</strong>: Yeah. I crave. Ya know? Brigitte chews very
slowly as she stares at Ginger. Ginger squints at Jason and his pals
across the yard.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: McCardy’s a stoner right?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah -?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: C’mon, I wanna feel better.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You joke. Ginger heads off toward the boys
- without waiting. Brigitte is in mid-,mouthful, and has to scramble to
catch up.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Uh - hi.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey. So. Nice day, blah blah blah. Got any
smoke?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Smoke. Grass, weed, dope, green, bud,
Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sh-sure.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Wanna share?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I was all like, so who are you, an’ what
have you done with my sister, right? Brigitte climbs in.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey. I thought your slide show in art was
cool.</p>
<p><strong>other guys</strong>: Oh yeah/Unh-huh/Very cool.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This home-grown?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah. This guy we know? Learned hydrophonics
in the pen, man.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: HydroPONics.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah, whatever. Brigitte gapes at Ginger, who
does not respond. Brigitte hides beneath her hair and presses even
further into a corner. She starts quietly ripping up the corner of the
old shag rug. There is a codified knock on the vain door. Brigitte
jumps.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: speak of the devil. Enter! The back doors
open and Sam stands in silhouette, backlit by the day. His battered
county truck waits behind him. He has a pit bull with him - MORELY.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Sam the Man! Hey Morely! Sam and Morely hop in
and close the doors. Brigitte is frozen at the sight of Sam up so
close.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Whoa dude. What happened to your truck?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit. Had an accident on the 403. It was weird
it../ Morely stomps into Brigitte’s lap, sniffing her crotch.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry about him, he’s an ass hole. Morely! My
girlfriend’s, she won’t leave him at home alone any more. Ya know, dog
killers. Morely, no! Sit! Brigitte’s mouth is hanging open. Morely
slobbers all over her hands.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I know, I look like an asshole. Ginger’s
perma-smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with Morely. Morel
growls at her. Sam is about to resume his accident story when,</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Watcha got for us? Sam produces several
baggies of grass. Morely’s hackles rise. Brigitte looks from the dog to
Ginger, Ginger squirms.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: New harvest, see whatcha think. What’s your
problem? Never seen a pretty girl before? Ginger sneers at Morely and
Morely bares his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>jason/tim/frank</strong>: Thanks, man. Morely bursts out
barking and charges at Ginger. Mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog
in the small space. Jason uses the opportunity to shield Ginger for a
free body press. Brigitte gets banged and shoved. Ginger kicks and
screams at the dog, her boot connects squarely with his snout. Morely
keels back, and Sam snaps him up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, he’s not really like this. I’m really
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Jus’ get’im out!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m really - well, see you guys. And in another
flash of daylight, Sam and Morely are gone. Brigitte looks longingly at
the closed door. The stone has set in, and everyone but Brigitte giggles
as they settle. Brigitte takes in the Lesser Mortals like they’re
lepers.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Yeah. Just hate dogs. They give one another
this corny smile. Brigitte bugs her eyes at Ginger. Ginger rises
reluctantly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Well. Thanks for the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Maybe we could –/ Ginger places a finger to
her lips, then makes a finger gun and shoots him.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’ll letcha know. Ginger grins ear-to-ear,
elbowing Brigitte. Ginger kicks the van doors open and saunters out.
Brigitte :Follows, trying not to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’ll letcha, I’ll jus’ let-choo know. Bud.
.So Ginger. Wanna tell me about you and like, the planet yer currently
visiting? No answer. Brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to
her. She tries to work it without putting money in. She smacks her dry
lips. Brigitte bends over the sink and drinks from the tap.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee-? Brigitte doesn’t hear her over the
roar of the tap in her face. It shuts off automatically over her gaping
mouth. Brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it
stuck.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee!</p>
<p>****: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Com’ere-! Brigitte shuffles to the wrong
door, opens it and finds it empty. She giggles and moves to the next
one.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: That smoke fucked me <em>up.</em> up.
Brigitte finds Ginger with her shirt and all, the bandages peeled off.
she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet paper. The scratches and
bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo, under which a fine film of dark
hairs have sprouted. Brigitte steps into the stall agape. The door hits
her on the way in.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Geez that’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: 1 didn’t think.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What’s the sticky stuff?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oooh. Tickly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I got it on my tits too, look.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Weird. Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No, it’s itchy. I can’t have a hairy chest
Bee, that’s fucked.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah, like forget that tattoo you
wanned.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This sucks.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Quito badly. The idiocy of the looks of
awe on the other’s face makes them both crack up.</p>
<p>****: This isn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>br i g itte</strong>: I know, but okay. what I think?</p>
<p>****: Attacked. On a full moon. Now, yer hairy.</p>
<p>****: I’m not Harry, I’m Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Stop, I’m serious. Think about it. Ginger
stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion settle.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: That’s so stupid! They both burst into gales
again. There is a sound outside the stall, as</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Eeeew! Trina backs away, her hands to her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Gawd: They’re lesbos!</p>
<p><strong>clones</strong>: Feeeewww!! Brigitte smacks her forehead.
Ginger steps out and leers at Trina, licking her lips in a grotesque
mock-lust. The Trinas shrink back against the farthest wall.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Yeah, who’s next? I’m still sticky!
Brigitte’s jaw drops. Ginger turns to leave and the Trinas, start to
relax. Ginger whips around again:</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Rrr-uf, ruf, rr-of-rufrf</p>
<p>****: Ginger gives the Trinas a good dead-eyed stave, and walks out.
Brigitte stumbles out after her.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: ’Course Trina din’t waste any time. Trina
stares Brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes it to a
classmate. It is read and passed on by every kid in the room during this
scene. Brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy -
hesitating. Ginger’s attention is riveted on the little carcass.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They’re all looking at us.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: So? Ginger looks up at Jason, who is reading
the note. Jason smiles at Ginger and destroys the note. Trina seethes.
Ginger grabs the knife from Brigitte. she makes a deep incision in the
pig’s belly.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: So! You’re growing fur an, acting like a
nut, is so! Ginger spies two girls giggling at her. Using both hands
Ginger cracks the carcass. wide open like a clam. Ginger digs in,
gouging out the pig’s parts with her bare hands. Ginger breaks into a
sweat, her breathing gets heavy. Brigitte cautiously looks around at
their classmates. she moves to shield Ginger from prying eyes.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Um. Ginger-?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: hold on, I’m goi.n’ for the brain. Ginger
has begun scraping away at the pig’s cranium with her finger nails. A
sickening creak, snap, and the brain is exposed. Ginger - unconsciously
- licks her fingers as she admires its frontal lobe.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Can’t believe you did that!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hunh? What? Before Brigitte can answer,
Ginger lifts the brain out on her finger tips, gently pushes Brigitte
out of her way and… Whap! The brain lands squarely on Trina’s head.
Trina screams.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ha-ha! Bull’s eye!</p>
<p><strong>bio teacher</strong>: Ginger Fitzgerald! Hall, NOW!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What, it slipped! As Ginger stomps out with
the teacher. Brigitte and Trina gape at one another.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: That week, Ginger was all over the map.
She was the goddamn schizo poster girl. She forgot the gyno guy. I
couldn’t believe she forgot. She promised. Brigitte is dying a thousand
deaths on the examining table with her feet in stirrups. The
GYNECOLOGIST is examining her. A NURSE stands next to him, smiling
benignly as she passes him the contraption used to take a pap smear.
Brigitte is almost in tears.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Same moment in the examination procedure,
but now Ginger is in the stirrups. And the doctor is shocked at his
findings.</p>
<p><strong>gyno</strong>: What the -?</p>
<p><strong>gyno</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it. She’s not
built like a normal girl. I’ve sent samples to the lab. But this is
very, VERY unusual. Brigitte pokes Ginger in the ribs. Ginger doesn’t
like this, and pushes Brigitte so hard she almost falls off her
chair.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Girls, please.</p>
<p><strong>int girls’ bedroom - night</strong>: The window is open.
Norman the terrier yams. Ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her
hair growth is spreading. Brigitte is sitting at. the desk with a pile
of monster books.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What’re you, nuts? I got a skin thing,
whatever.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: If you just gotta skin thing why does it
get worse everytime yer being a bitch? Why’s the gyno say you’re a
monster inside?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: He din’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>br i g itte</strong>: Just listen to these symptoms!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m takin’ a shower.</p>
<p>****: “The key to his survival is a constant diet of fresh warm-
blooded victims. His appetite is insatiable, and grows with each kill.
But his appetite is also the key to his own demise,</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: “.. .for eventually the blood- lust
over-takes human reason, overtakes oven the instinct for
self-preservation, and he will risk all for the excitement of the
euphoric high of his murders.” Ginger shaves the delicate area around
her ankles. She cuts herself and freaks. Ginger snaps the Lady Bic in
half and throws the pieces hard against the shower wall.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fuck fuck fuck FUCK There are two other
broken razors in the stall, stuffed with hairs. Blood mixes with the
water and swirls around her toes.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: But see all the books and movies an’ shit
said it had to be a full moon, that it’d be all at once. An, ya know,
not one word about chick werewolves on the rag. Typical.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sonnovabitch! Now livid, Ginger takes up a
dead tree branch. Up in the tree, Brigitte hides her face in her hands.
Ginger stops but Ginger keeps hitting. Blood splatters over her face.
And Ginger tastes it. Ginger drops her stick. She drags the body into
the hedge next to the fence. Brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes.
Ginger is directly below her, concealed from the house by the shrubs.
Ginger falls to her knees before the corpse. She lifts a rattling hand
to touch him. She lowers her face to the bloody mess. She’s sweating,
vibrating, physically resisting an irresistible drive. Ginger’s tongue
slips between her lips. And Ginger licks Morely’s body.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh. No. G-ginger -! Ginger begins to eat
the dead dog. The feed. quickly becomes a ravenous frenzy. Above her,
Brigitte leans over the branch she’s barely balancing on,
hyperventilating. Vomit sails down from Brigitte’s perch.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Shit. Brigitte scrambles down the tree
and yanks Ginger off the dog. Ginger’s face is smeared in blood.
Ginger’s stunned, and reels dizzily. They crouch, waiting. Their
NEIGHBOR opens the screen door, shaking a box of dog biscuits.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Dore-maan! Tweat-time! Hunh. The neighbor
steps into the yard. Approaches the hedge. Stops right before them -
they can see a pair of slippers twitching in the grass. Then they
disappear, the porch light switches off, the screen door shuts.</p>
<p>****: Ho-ow much is that daw-gy in the window… Arf-Arf!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ever been too sick to be sick? Like the
bottom of your stomach is wrapped over the top of your head? There is a
knock at the door. Brigitte checks the dead bolt is on.</p>
<p><strong>br igitte</strong>: Yeah?!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Who’s showering so late?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: she’s dirty?! Brigitte throws up her
hands: what an idiotic conversation.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Dirty!? How’d she get/</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: I’m tryin’ to study, here!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: oh, all right then. Brigitte slumps against
the door. The showers stops. Ginger appears in a towel, pink and clean
and freshly furry in places. She’s in a really good mood. She takes one
look at Brigitte’s face of doom and tries to be serious.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I couldn’t help it. Really. Guess you were
right. Ginger finds and lights a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You know what’s really weird?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Weirder than KILLING A DOG AND</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I liked it. I liked it a lot. I feel all
fucki.n’ goofy now. Like, I dunno. Like .happy? Brigitte shakes her head
over and over.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I feel like I just got off the Planet
Smasher ride at WarWorid, okay? It rules! Ginger leaps to the stereo and
blasts on some tunes. She flails around the room wildly. Ginger grabs
Brigitte by the arms and makes her dance too. Ginger spins and spins
Brigitte, who fights it but laughs.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: So she’d killed Norman. 1 never seen
anyone bliss out like that. I wanted to be so blissed, jus’ once. There
is repeated pounding on their door. Brigitte still entangled in Ginger,
hits the music off.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Little late for that, girls.</p>
<p><strong>ginger/brigitte</strong>: /Sorry; They stand in each other’s
arms listening to Pamela mount the stairs OFF SCREEN. Ginger shoves
Brigitte backward onto her bed. Ginger piles on top of her, playfully
pinning her down.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I want more. Brigitte squirms fitfully.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: No, it’s too gross! You’ll get
caught.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Not if you help. Bee. I’m starving. Brigitte
looks into her sister’s beaming face.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Jus’ keep watch. Look, I’m gonna be
somethin’ totally else. Tell me you don’t so dig it. Tell me you don’t
wanna see what happens. Brigitte groans.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Straight up? Crazy’s contagious. Trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: M-m-mMOMI?</p>
<p><strong>cut back to:</strong>: Days get ticked off on the feminine
hygiene calendar… BRIGITTE We became the Beast of Bailey Downs. We got
good.. The moon vanishes, then reappears in as a First Quarter, as
Brigitte’s getting the hang of things, she practices expert surveillance
from car roofs, throws stones to trip motion- sensitive lamps, starts
moving like a super spy, taking crime-scene style Polaroids of their
victims, as</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The more we did, the crazier she got…</p>
<p><strong>int girls’ bedroom - night</strong>: Brigitte shoves a
fist-full of collars under their mattresses.</p>
<p><strong>jump back to:</strong>: On the field, Ginger climbs up on the
goal post and walks carefully across the narrow beam.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The crazier she got, the more she needed
me. I liked that part. In their room, Brigitte helps Ginger shave her
back. Ginger trims her elongating nails. Brigitte plucks hairs from
Ginger’s palms. Ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth comes off
- she has a little fang.</p>
<p><strong>jump to:</strong>: on the field both Brigitte and Ginger hang
upside down from the goal post by their knees. Brigitte is wearing a dog
collar as a necklace. They are laughing their heads off and trying to
pull each other’s shirts down to expose each other’s breasts.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Pig.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You love it. Brigitte examines the feminine
hygiene calendar. In it, a cartoon of a female egg is personified with a
heels and sunglasses, strutting across the date.</p>
<p><strong>brtgitte</strong>: trey, look yer ovulating. Ginger rubs her
belly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m still hungry, Bee.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: How can you - you’ve done every dog we
can</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s not enough. I want somethin’… I need
more.</p>
<p><strong>ginger snaps -walton</strong>: Jason gapes as Ginger heads
toward him with an unlit smoke between her pointy teeth. She leaves an
inch between his chest and her breasts.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Got a light, Jace’? Jason and his pals all
fumble for lighters and five little flames appear before her smoke. She
lights her smoke on Jason’s, and exhaling looks him up and down. The
boys flames go out, all at once.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: My sister would like one also. obediently,
they all light up for Brigitte. Brigitte falters before the attention.
At Ginger’s nod, Brigitte lights up too.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Slut. Ginger turns to see Trina and the
Clones sizing her up.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Excuse me? Ginger seems to tower over the
Trinas today. Trina can’t match the menace. Ginger exhales smoke in
Trinals face and climbs the steps into the school. Brigitte double-takes
Ginger’s back. Ginger’s spine is protruding sharply through her shirt.
Trina leers at Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Better watch your back, Fitzenstein. Brigitte
snorts and follows Ginger in.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Like I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>int english class - day</strong>: Ginger chews her nails like
a dog does when cleaning them. Brigitte and the rest of the class watch
an RCMP OFFICER holding a reward poster at the front of the room.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: we need your cooperation. If you know
anything about the so- called Beast of Bailey Downs, call in. You can be
anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ha! As if they weren’t already.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: But your pets aren’t safe until the
perpetrator is caught. Ginger sighs loudly and Brigitte prods her.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger! Ginger’s rolling the taste of
Trina’s blood around in her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Mmnun .</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You can’t do that, That’s human blood!
.Feel anything? Brigitte and Ginger stare at one another. Ginger first
shakes her head., but then nods. Ginger looks around and whispers</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s sick but - I’m all like horny. Brigitte
makes a sour face.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Fitzgerald, bench!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What, she started it! Brigitte watches
Ginger march to the sidelines, throwing off her gear as she goes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Pick that stuff up! Ginger gives Sykes the
finger without looking back. Brigitte groans.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Yer bitch sister’s dead, freak.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Fuck off. Jason lopes up. He indicates the
guidance office door.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Ginger in there again? Brigitte ignores
him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Cool. Um. Look, Belinda…</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Right, right. T’d really like to take yer
sister out. Think you could ask her for me?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey. I could fix you up too. I guess.
Brigitte seethes.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Fuck. Never mind, I’ll ask her myself. Freak.
Jason takes a post on the opposite Brigitte to wait. Brigitte glares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Look, you keep getting sent here. We
might as well be friendly.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I don’t do friendly, Mr. Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Hey. I know where you’re coming from. I
was a kid once too.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Really? So was I. Weird. Ginger fakes an
eye-lash batting smile. She winds the condom over her erect fingers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Okay, you aren’t a kid. You’re a young
adult. With some issues. Let’s explore them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Hey. I’m reaching out here. Your plays
for attention are a cry for help, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Is it a problem at home? With your
parents?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They think I’m cute. Mr. Wayne sighs.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Maybe I ought to split you and your
sister up.</p>
<p><strong>gtnger</strong>: Aw, c’mon Mr. Wa-ayne. Divide aii’ conquer?
That’s so old.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: Hey. You’re antisocial, antagonistic, and
now violent. The point of high school is you learn to develop a place
for yourselves in society…/</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: ’Long as you like it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: As long as you’re at this school young
lady, I better like it. Ginger gives him a cold, dead stare.</p>
<p><strong>mr. wayne</strong>: consider this your final warning. I see
you outta line again, and we’re talking expulsion. And don’t look at me
like that, missy.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Fuckin’ guidance my ass. She pounds her fist
into a locker and makes a dent. Brigitte cringes. Ginger admires the
damage.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Holy… Ginger notices Jason and visibly
brightens.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey. whatcha doin’ now?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Nothin’ special.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wanna go for a ride?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sure. C’mon Bee. Jason and Brigitte’s faces
darken simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger, we should get home.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No we shouldn’t. Brigitte drags Ginger
aside. Ginger notes Brigitte’s hand squeezing her arm with a dangerous
look.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Twenty minutes ago you coulda killed
somebody. Is this really a good time to start dating? I don’t think so.
Ginger shakes Brigitte’s hand off.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Well, I do.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Why?! Look, grow up a little an’ maybe
you’ll get it</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Forget it, I’m goin’. I’ll draw ya a picture
later, ’kay? Ginger takes Jason’s hand and pulls him off to the exit.
Jason gives Brigitte SUCH a smug look over his shoulder. Brigitte stands
alone in the hall, gaping after them.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: When Henry renovated the basement, to
build our room? I was like ten an, in the way an, shit. Well, he rammed
iue with this beam, right in my stomach. Accidentally. Brigitte wanders
over the emptying school. lot. She looks small and alone. She looks
disoriented.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: But all the air came outta my lungs at
once an, I kept tryin’ to breathe but I couldn’t. I forgot all about
that. Till like right now. Brigitte consults the hygiene calendar.
Ginger’s ending the third week of checked-off days. A special note on
today’s date asks DO YOU HAVE PMS?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Ouch! whoa. Can’t believe you never had a
boyfriend… Ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead
cold. Jason dives back at her for more. Ginger looks both aroused and
unnerved by her arousal. Ginger’s stomach growls. Ginger pushes Jason
off of her.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I have to go. It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s only six o’clock. Jason presses himself
on her again. Ginger shoves him off, hard.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: 1-have-to-go.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh. Now you get all moody on me?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey_ You got no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Chicks, yer all the same! Ginger stops in her
tracks. She shakes her head and continues away.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Cock tease!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>int fitzgerald bungalow - night</strong>: Brigitte descends
the stairs to her room. Music blasts from the basement.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Brigitte? Tell your sister to turn that
stereo down!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Stop screaming or I’ll rip your permed head
right off you neck. An’ ya know what? I can do that. Now open wide
Ginger force-feeds Trina something on a spoon. Trina screams with her
mouth full, trying to spit it back out. Ginger offers Trina a glass of
milk.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Chaser? No?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger WHAT are you doing-! Ginger grins
and shows Bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Jus’ like you said, Bee! S’ perfect!
Brigitte grabs the bowl away: glass shards and tacks rain around
them.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey! I’m Join’ this for you! As the sisters
argue, Trina rocks the chair back and forth, trying to free herself.</p>
<p><strong>br i g itte</strong>: Oh no, no way… No!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Yer still burnt over Jason!</p>
<p><strong>br i g itte</strong>: No, Ginger, I’m burnt ’cause you don’t
see like jail in yer future! You don’t get how hugely fucked this is! DO
you? Trina lurches back hard and rocks forward. Trina struggles to get
her toes to meet the floor. She lurches back for more momentum.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You sayin’ I’m stupid?!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’m sayin’ she? Will tell on you! This is
someone who will tell! Trina throws herself forward again and her toes
connect firmly with the floor - just as her temple connects with a
sickening CRACK on the sharp corner of the desk. The milk glass dumps on
top of her.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ha-ha. Ginger grabs her own right arm and
shudders with pain.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ow. Ow. Owchee-wow-ow. Brigitte takes Trina
in from head to toe. Brigitte checks Trina for a pulse. Brigitte snaps
her hand back as though it were burned. A tremor wracks Brigitte’s body
and she convulses. Brigitte runs to the bathroom. OFF SCREEN, Brigitte
throws up. Meanwhile Ginger raises her afflicted hand. The hand is
nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw. The nails are
black, curling claws. Oblivious, Brigitte climbs back into bed and
covers her face with a pillow.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: My life is basically over.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee. ..BEE! Awestruck, they both watch as
Ginger extends and retracts her: new set of claws. There is a knock at
the door. The girls look at one another in mute horror. Ginger addresses
the door.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Are you two fighting?!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: – No!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: come on then. Dinner’s ready. Brigitte and
Ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>tnt fitzgerald dining room - night</strong>: Ginger has her
new paw curled up in an over-sized sweat jacket sleeve. Brigitte stares
at the stew before them with grave distaste. Pamela has a number of used
tissues around her - she’s been crying.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: The gynecologist called. Pamela grasps
Ginger’s gnarly arm and squeezes it through her sleeve. Brigitte and
Ginger look at Pamela’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: There’s something wrong, Ginger. He wants to
do an ultra-sound!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Pamela, don’t scare her. How could the cells
not be human cells? we’ll send you to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’m sure your father’s right. I’m just
upset… How are you feeling, do you feel. all right?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Um. sure. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: No unusual discharge or anything like that?
Henry, Brigitte and Ginger groan.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I worry, all right? I’ve made another
appointment with a new doctor. Early next month was the earliest he
could see you. okay?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: okay. They all begin eating in silence.
Except Brigitte who gags as Henry squirts ketchup all over his stew.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Told you.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Rigor mortis. Knew we shoulda skipped
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Can we do it my way now? Brigitte hesitates,
her anxieties rising.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: So is this it? You doin’ people now?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: She won’t fit unless I</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: You know what I mean. Just say.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I din’t kill her!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: But were you gonna? There is a long pause.
Ginger tries to laugh it off with,</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No. I’m not doing people. No. Brigitte takes
a deep breath, nodding. She acts belief.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: ’Kay. .Hurry up. Ginger drags a section of
the body into the playhouse with her. Disgusting gnashing and tearing,
bones snapping and other sounds of devouring are heard from within.
Brigitte keeps watch. Tears appear in her eyes. The body is dragged
another foot into the playhouse. Ginger is eating Trina to make her fit
in the grave.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Trina was dead. Trina was dinner. This was
BAD.An’I kept wonderin’ what Sam was doin’ right then. I couldn’t help
it, he jus’ kept poppin’ into my head, like.</p>
<p><strong>int a family-size freezer - dawn</strong>: Brigitte lifts the
lid of a large freezer. OUR POV IS FROM INSIDE THE FREEZER. Its light
illuminates the brown paper parcels Ginger sets inside, next to the
frozen waffles and veggies. The parcels are labeled T-bone, T-thigh,
T-breast.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What Ginger couldn’t finish we froze,
’cause the less we left for whoever would find Trina, the better. Watch
a lot of crime TV, so. Brigitte’s sizing Ginger up behind her back.
Ginger finishes loading the freezer. Brigitte drops the lid.</p>
<p><strong>int girls’ bedroom – later that night</strong>: The room is
dark. Ginger is asleep. Brigitte is in bed with her back turned to
Ginger’s bed. Brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster
books. She is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow flowers.</p>
<p>****: “The Beast was usually finally eliminated with a bullet, the
cost of breaking the curse the human life that bore it.,, oh
man.”However many believed wolfs bane had the power not only to protect
the innocent, but calmed those afflicted to a restored sense of reason
and self- control.”</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What:cha Join’ ? Brigitte nearly jumps into
orbit, slamming her book shut as Ginger appears over her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hm. Big Book of Monsters, hunh. Thought they
were useless.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: They are. Couldn’t sleep. So. Rrigitte
gives Ginger a nervous smile. Ginger smiles back. Her fangs show.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Man, I’m not getting enough sleep. Ginger
closes the bathroom door. Brigitte leaps to the door, looping one end of
a noosed extension cord around the handle. The other end is tied to the
door handle of the bedroom door. Brigitte checks to ensure the latter is
bolted shut.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: The fuck -? Beef Brigitte watches the
vibrating length of cord hold the door firmly in place. Ginger bangs
hard on the door.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger, don’t be pissed…</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Open the fuckin’ door you feeb.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No! Ginger pounds on the door with great
violence.</p>
<p><strong>br i</strong>: Want Pamela dc h, e? The pounding Sto2s.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: We have to stop it Ginge’. If we can. I`ll
be back before dark. Brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her
book and leaves by the window.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Told Pammy Ginger wasn’t feeling well.
Just to get her checkin’ regular on. her, keep the pressure on Ginger to
be cool.</p>
<p><strong>ext county greenhouses - day</strong>: Brigitte steps off a
county bus at the drive. There’s a police car parked next to the Sam’s
truck. She looks back to the bus, but the doors swing shut and it pulls
away. Brigitte smoothes her hair, takes a deep breath, and over- acts
innocent as she walks up.</p>
<p><strong>int county greenhouse - day</strong>: Brigitte can hear male
voices as she minces down the leafy aisles.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: It’s in your best interests to be
cooperative.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My lawyer’s co-operative, I just know my
rights. I don’t know where she is, I’m very concerned. That’s it, unless
you got a warrant. She ends up backing into a COP behind some palms.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Shhh-it! I mean, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You can see I got customers, so if that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay. Sure. For now. The cop gives Sam a final
Dirty Harry squint and leaves. Sam collects himself with difficulty. So
does Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: if you skipped school lookin’ to score, I don’t
keep nothin’ here at work, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I din’t. I mean I skipped, but-/</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey. From Mccardy’s van, right? You know my
girlfriend? Trina Sinclair?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Rinda.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You seen her today?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Not today…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Fuck. She’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh. S-sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, well. Cops think I know where she is. I
don’t. Sam looks Brigitte right in the eye. Brigitte is caught up in him
for a second.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, what do you care right? What do you
need.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Um. Lookin’ for this. She holds out the
torn page. Sam takes it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Aconitum lycoctonum? Sorry. Brigitte yanks her
own hair hard. Sam smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tryin’ to kill somebody? Well, you know it’s
poisonous, right? Wolfs bane? Deadly. Be like stocking hemlock an,
shit.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No, I thought it did something else.
Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Anyways they’re perennials - only flowers in
spring. Brigitte turns to leave, hot with frustration, huinilliation.
Sam watches her stamp toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey. Ranunculaceae come in about a hundred
species. I’ve gotta cousin, monkshood. Not so toxic. If you’re
interested.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t know if it’d help.</p>
<p><strong>int greenhouse – moments later</strong>: They sit together
amidst beautiful plants and flowers. Sam. picks a tiny purple flower
from a bed of young plants and hands it to Brigitte.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: S’called monkshood ’cause people used to think
it kept ’em pure from dirty thoughts. Seriously.</p>
<p>****: Make my life easier. Sam laughs. Surprised by this, Brigitte
smiles and hides under her hair.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: This is awful. but the whole time I was
with him there? I din’t even think how I’d just put pieces of his
girlfriend in the deep freeze, like, at all.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Ginger, feeling any better? Ginger climbs
noiselessly out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: The book said dry it out before using it.
I figured I’d keep Ginger locked up - feeding her Trina - till it was
ready. she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker. The buzzer
goes as she slams the door shut.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Fitzgerald. Tardy! My office</p>
<p><strong>now!</strong>: Ginger faces him with a dreadful
expression.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: If any of you have seen Trina please let us
know. She went for a run this morning and has not returned or contacted
her family or friends…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Sit down, Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I can’t stay.</p>
<p><strong>waynf:</strong>: I said, sit.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: An’ I said ./</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: You are expelled. This is not your personal
playground, this is a school.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hello, main office? This is Mrs. Fitzgerald.
would you page my daughter Brigitte please? I’m waiting to meet her in
the guidance office. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>pa system</strong>: Would Brigitte Fitzgerald please report
to guidance. Brigitte Fitzgerald. Brigitte freezes. The cop, the
teacher, the whole class look at her. Brigitte scoops up her stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t ever fuck with me like that again.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You .got out. Brigitte gapes at all the
blood. Ginger is very agitated.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: He asked for it. Was gonna expel me. So.
Backing away, Brigitte trips over Mr. Wayne’s foot sticking out from
under the desk.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What do we do, Bee? What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: C’mon we need a fuckin’ plan here! The
school bell goes off. Brigitte snaps out of her daze, reaches up and
hits the light switch off. They now sit in virtual darkness.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Last bell. wait till everyone goes. We’ll
stuff him someplace. Clean this up. I guess. The sound of the full halls
around them seems very loud now.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee, gotta a smoke? Brigitte hands her a
smoke.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t be mad, ’ kay?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’m not mad.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Stay here. Lock the door. I’ll knock once.
Ginger nods. Brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor. Ginger
shuts the door. Then Ginger whips it open again.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Shut the door, Ginger!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bee?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Thanks. Brigitte blinks at her, then
continues to skulk away. The office door shuts and the lock locking
reverbs after her.</p>
<p><strong>vent</strong>: Ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of
it’s case and unleashes foam into the halls.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: STOP IT! Just stop. Enough, Ginger.
Please. Please. Ginger throws the canister any way, forcing Brigitte to
dive out of the way. SMASH! Glass rains down over. Brigitte. Brigitte
lifts her head in time to see Ginger burn down the hall looking for more
mischief. Brigitte curls into a fetal position, burying her face in her
lap and rocks herself. Brigitte sobs. OFF-SCREEN we hear Ginger
cont.inuing her ram a e else where in the school. Brigitte wanders up to
the janitor’s cart, looking like a plane crash survivor - dazed and
wretched. Brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid. She sniffs it.
She closes her eyes and tips it back. She washes it around in her mouth
and lifts her chin to swallow. She spews it into the air, the taste
making her heave instinctively. she dry heaves a couple of times. She
throws the bottle at the wall.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Well, well well..</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: The fair sisters Fitzgerald.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Hey. How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You tell me. Tim cracks the door and takes a
look inside.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Holy shit - they trashed the place! The guys
gawk: they are very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Who–oooaa. Fuck, unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Ginger, I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What can I say. I had an urgo.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Cool. But. This is ya know, uh, a bit of a
problem. What’s gonna happen when they start lookin’ for the ah, people
responsible? Brigitte glares at Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You won’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh I might.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger -?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Shut up. Shut up. How ’ bout a deal.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Have to be sweet.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You keep our lil’ secret and I do you. All
a’ you. Brigitte slumps against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Jason gets the eager nod from his gang.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Okay, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Not now - I’m a mess. We’re having a
Halloween party at. our place, Friday night. We’ll do it then.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah, right Saturday. You’ll ditch.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I won’t ditch. But you guys say a word about
this to any one, - and there’s no action. So it’s up to you. You stay
quiet, you score. You don’t - phhtt - nice knowin’ ya.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Deal. He extends his hand to shake on it.
Linger shakes it awkwardly with her good hand. Brigitte thumps her head
against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: C’mon Bee…</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Shut up, leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: It’s not that big a deal.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: How can you say that! Two people are dead
because of you. Us.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: They pissed me off. Brigitte opens the
bathroom door.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh. Then they we asking for it? What about
Jason an’ them? Gonna kill ‘em all when yer done, Ginger? ’Cause you
have to take yer clothes OFF for that shit, they wanna SEE yer BODY for
that shit, you gonna let like five guys live to tell how they fucked the
Beast a’ Bailey Downs? That could annoy you too! Ginger prods a claw
into Brigitte’s chest, pinning her in place.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Think yer sooo smart? I think yer sooo
jealous.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah, I’m jealous yer turning into a
nympho. I’m so jealous yer killing people who did never did nothing to
you. Yeah Ginger. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oh, wow.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: I don’t wanna do this any more. Ginger’s
claw pricks Brigitte’s skin. Brigitte cringes. Blood appears around the
claw.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’m sorry, but…! Brigitte writhes in pain
as Ginger’s claw slices in deeper.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger?! This is me. Ginger retracts the
claw, and Brigitte grabs the wound.</p>
<p><strong>so?</strong>: Ginger hurls Brigitte against the wall. Ginger
throws herself on top of Brigitte. Ginger raises her killing claw to Bri
g.iLt.e’ s neck.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Who needs you? Brigitte is helpless and
looks terrified. Ginger’s face is contorted with intensity, with
madness. Ginger’s drooling. A drip of gob drops onto Brigitte’s
face.</p>
<p>****: Ginger… Ginger lifts Brigitte by the shirt-front and searches
her eyes. Ginger drops Brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat.
Brigitte grabs Ginger’s leg.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Don’t, please! Brigitte struggles to hang
on, to rise from the floor; Ginger’s really hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Maybe we can stop it! Lemme try! Ginger
kicks free.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: An’ spoil my fun? I’ll skin you alive first.
Brigitte struggles to a point between Ginger and the window.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: You’re fucked without me. They’ll catch
you. Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No, you wake up! Nobody’ll live to catch me.
Yer a two-faced lil’ chicken shit? Your problem, Brigitte. I don’t need
ya. I don’t WANTCHA! So stay away from me or I’ll kill you I swear I’ll
have you for breakfast. Brigitte backs out of Ginger’s way. Ginger steps
up i.o the window and climbs through. Brigitte rubs her throat, trying
hard to keep breathing. Brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an
Adidas gym bag from under it. Brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the
floor and jamming them into the bag.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I was like, okay. Fuck you too. She’d be
sorry. And I’d be like, I dunno - somewheres’ totally else goin’ not my
problem. Right.</p>
<p><strong>ext service lane - night</strong>: Brigitte trudges up to the
bus stop next to the fence of the playhouse yard with her full Adidas
bag. Light streams from inside the yard, multi-coloured, strobing. It
looks like a UFO has landed on the other side of the fence. She peers
through the slats. She sees the playhouse, lit up like a Christmas tree.
She sees gloved hands and police uniforms. Then sliding past, the long -
almost endless - shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse:
they’ve found Trina’s body. The bus appears, approaching from way down
the road.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: But you can’t break up with blood. You
can’t divorce yer sister. You jus’ can’t. The bus passes, obscuring
Brigitte from view as its body fills frame. when its tail lights pass,
Brigitte is far down the street, running like a champion in the
direction she came from.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’d get the monkshood from my locker at
school the next morning. Brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the
light on. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’d find Ginger, I’d find out if the stuff
even worked. Brigitte locks the window shut. She locks the bedroom door
and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I could deal with whatever, as long as I
tried. If it was the last thing she ever saw me do, it was gonna be me
goin’ fer somethin’ by myself. The real Ginger woulda dug that large.
Brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat out of the
closet.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I would try to save my sister when the sun
came up. You know, if the sun came up. Brigitte climbs into bed,
snuggling the bat in with her. She lights a smoke. She finds the
feminine hygiene calendar on the bedside table next to the photo of the
girls as kids at Halloween, taken many years before. The calendar tells
us it is about to be Friday. Friday is the full moon. Friday is
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>int girls’ room - dawn</strong>: The lamp is still on. The
ash tray is full of butts. Brigitte stirs in her sleep. Ginger stands at
the end of Brigitte’s bed, staring at her. Brigitte snaps to, gripping
the bat. Ginger snorts, and climbs into her own bed. Brigitte swings her
gaze to the window. It is still shut and locked. The bureau is still in
front of the door. Brigitte holds her hat tightly and watches her
sister’s back in the next bed, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>female students</strong>: Ginger Fitzgerald is such a
slut./No kidding./The bitch.</p>
<p><strong>various students</strong>: You hear about Trina Sinclair?/Dug
her up in somebody’s back yard!/oh that’s so sad!/ Poor Trina, Ga-awd!
As Brigitte gets closer to the building, she finds police cars and cops
at the main entrance.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Shit. PRINCIPAL FARDOR is speaking with
the RCMP constable who has been visiting classes. Fardor holds a hanky
over his face.</p>
<p><strong>fardor</strong>: That stench near the staff offices, what is
that you think? Brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I couldn’t say, sir. Now is there anyone
you suggest we talk to? Anyone with something against the school?
Brigitte slips past the two men.</p>
<p><strong>fardor</strong>: For god’s sake look around you. I got 350
angry young people bored blind.Helluva day for my goddamn cleaning staff
to be late … . IIEY! Brigitte stops at the threshold.</p>
<p><strong>fardor</strong>: The hell you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: I left something in my locker.</p>
<p><strong>fardor</strong>: Find your homeroom and wait. School’s outta
bounds until we call you in. Get! Brigitte backs down the steps, looking
like she just took a good slap. She turns to confront the mass confusion
around her. Brigitte spots Ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the
lot now, surrounded by boys. Brigitte spots Sam’s truck near-by.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey. Wolfs bane. Wanna drink? Brigitte stops
and turns to face him. Sam dries his face on his sleeve and pops his
passenger door. Brigitte looks around and slides in. Ginger is watching
Brigitte out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I showed up to see Trina? But she’s I’m goin’
strange in the head. Brigitte doesn’t know what to say, so she offers
his a smoke. He takes it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why? Why would ya do a thing like that?
Brigitte examine his. face for an implication. There isn’t one.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s unny is I dumped her that night. Feel
bad about it now. Truth is, she was a pain in the ass. I sound like a
jerk, right.</p>
<p><strong>br igitte</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Really? Yeah well, while she was -
disappearin’, I’m off have a time at the Highway Home with my buddy
Georgio. Drinkin’, dealin’ - an, now she’s Sam is over-come again.
Brigitte raises a hand to touch him, chickens out, and then scores on
the second attempt. He rolls right into her arms.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, this is strange. I don’t even …Last time
I saw her she was so mad at me. An’ we did have some times, we did.
Makes me sick what her last thought a’ me musta been though. Their eyes
meet, their faces are inches apart. Brigitte kisses him, very softly and
very quickly and then pulls out. Sam looks shocked. Brigitte looks more
shocked.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I’m really, um. Sam leans in and kisses
her right back. Better. Longer.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit. Sorry. Kinda freaked. You know? I
shouldn’t, well.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But that was really nice.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh. ’Kay. Good. They sit staring straight
ahead a moment. A cop ahead double- takes them, and reaches into his car
for the radio mic.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You wanna lil’ dube or somethin’? Listenin’ to
me go on like a loser-What’s yet- name?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Brigitte. Fitzgerald. No, that’s okay. I
need more monkshood…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes! Dirty thoughts! oh. I been drinkin’.
Should not drive. Right, Brr-igitte? Brigitte drags her hands over her
face with extreme anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh, right. OK. Ur.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ginger’s yer sister right? Sam grimaces as
Brigitte nods.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, rumors - say she’s doin’ all these guys at
some party. Goias’ around she’s a big time ho’, that kinder thing. Hey.
Don’t worry about it. Nobody mentioned you. Ginger’s most maniacal laugh
drifts over to them. Brigitte sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a
car with a whole crowd of leering boys.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: C’mon Ginger! Take it off!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You wish!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Hey Ginger? Watcha doin’ later? Can we come
to yer bash?! Ginger stops dancing. Anger floods her face.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: You know about that?</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Sure, everybody knows! Can I bring my
cousin?</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: What -?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Like to see ya again. Can I come to yer party
too?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: sh-sure. Sorry. I gotta - Ginger, so.
Brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another with that
look you get when you’re scared because you just kissed someone you
really, really like.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: fie was jus’ drunk, I’m thinkin’. I mean
he prob’ly din’t mean it. Whatever. Beyond Sam’s truck, behind Brigitte,
the two new cruisers lurch to a stop. Cops approach Sam’s vehicle with
extreme caution. Brigitte arrives at the car with Ginger as,</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: All a’ you guys?! My house! Tonight! I wanna
party with everybody. we’ll do it till you drop.</p>
<p><strong>hoo!</strong>: The crowd applauds. Brigitte stares at Ginger
like she’s watching a cruise missile coming in. Ginger notices Brigitte
watching her. Ginger pretends she doesn’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger was gonna kill every one of l em. A
commotion behind them causes everyone to turn. Sam is being dragged from
his truck by the cops. He is flung face-first onto the hood and
hand-cuffed.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sam McDonald? You’re under arrest for the
murder of Trina Sinclair. Brigitte physically fights with herself not to
yell out. She runs a few steps toward Sam. Brigitte looks back at
Ginger, who drills her with an evil warning glare. The cops shove Sam
into the back of a cruiser. They roar off. Brigitte stands alone, apart
from the crowd. The cruisers’ flashing lights disappear down the street.
Brigitte turns to face Ginger, mustering her own first menacing look.
Ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: They closed the school that day. So I
never got to my locker. So I never got the monkshood. I thought, this is
it. I fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Now just remember, no boys in you bedroom
during this party. Your room is off limits. Ginger are you sure that
arm’s not sprained, or worse?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Bruise. Lacrosse.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Mm Henry when’d you get this new meat from
Tinny’s? Quite nice. Brigitte and Ginger exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I haven’t been to Tinny’s.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Then where’s all the packs marked “t” come
from -? Brigitte spits out her food.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I be excused?</p>
<p><strong>911 operator</strong>: 911, do you need fire, ambulance or
police, please.</p>
<p>****: Sam McDonald is not the Beast of Bailey Downs. He was at the
Highway Home Motel when Trina Sinclair was killed. Sam didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: In case this was the last thing I’d do. I
wanned Sam out of it. Sam shouldn’t suffer.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That Sinclair girl was found at the
Bernstein’s, can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What, last night? I didn’t hear a thing!
Never going to have these done in time. Henry help. Pamela is feverishly
creating little straw witches and such party decorations. She has a
se]ecl.i.on of dried flowers, wheat etc on the table before her.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Brigitte, honey we’re thrilled you two are
making friends. But next time you two do something like this give Mummy
a little more notice, will you? Hate having to scramble. Brigitte slides
into her regular chair and props her hands on her wrists in an attitude
of complete distraction.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: What’s your sister up to? Brigitte looks at
Henry as he works on a little witch.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: She said she had a lot of work to do on her
costume. Should we dress up, you think? Henry grimaces. He sifts through
the dried plants before them. Brigitte double-takes the pile.</p>
<p><strong>pame-la</strong>: oh, Henry. You’re no fun at all.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Just weeds, old cuttings from the yard.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: No, THIS stuff. Brigitte plucks out a
handful of dried plant with tiny purple flowers.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Oh, I had that around the dahlias. Man at
the greenhouse said it’d keep the cats out. Seemed to do the job. It’s
got a funny name - nun’s robe, priest hat, something</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Monkshood.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That’s right. Do we have a budding botanist
in the family?!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Pun intended. Pamela giggles as does Henry.
Brigitte grabs a fistful of monkshood and races for the door.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Hey, we need that! Brigitte! But Brigitte is
gone.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That was my accent colour!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hey. Must be the place, right? Brigitte
sneers at him. He holds a half-gone bottle of schnapps, a dress shirt
and his Good Jeans on. The toilet flushes in the john. Brigitte knocks
on the door.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: McCardy’s here. The bathroom door unlocks
but. remains closed.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Git in here an, gimme a hand. Brigitte casts
an uncertain look at Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: C’mon ladies, there’s six other guys sitting
in the shrub waiting. Brigitte’s face darkens. She slips into the
bathroom and shuts the door.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Do you think some people deserve to
die?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Don’t say a fuckin’ word. Ginger lowers the
towel she’s wearing enough to show the bump on her butt is now a
twitching tail. Brigitte gasps.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Take this gauze and tie it flat.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger, you can’t</p>
<p><strong>do it!</strong>: Brigitte takes the roll of gauze. She grabs
the tail between her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust.
Brigitte’s hands tremble.</p>
<p><strong>tnt girls bathroom - night</strong>: Brigitte tapes the gauze
in place. Ginger throws a robe on and grabs the door.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Now get outta my life. Brigitte grits her
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: I gotta get ready for the party.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Then wait here till I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: What, through all fifty a’ them?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oh, don’t tempt me. Ginger takes a deep
breath before she opens the bathroom door. Her breath is ragged. She
smoothes her hair and chews her lip. She’s nervous. Ginger opens the
door and closes it behind her.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s really dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m shy. Lay down. Brigitte puts the toilet
seat down and sits on it. Brigitte lights a smoke. Brigitte withdraws
the monkshood from under her shirt and has a good scratch where it was
itching her. OFF-SCREEN are the sounds of slurp kisses and Jason’s
moans. A fly unzips. Clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor. Bed
springs creak. Plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then the SNAP-WHAP of
one being fitted on pretty roughly. Somewhere above them the door bell
starts ringing. From a vanity cupboard she pulls a Zombie face-painting
kit and sets it next to the monkshood.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Notice any girls? Pamela shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: In English I heard about this chick who
used a man’s name to get her books read. She went by George but she was
really Mary Ann? Goes, “It’s never too late to be what you might have
been.” I was jus’ there thinkin’, is that true? Was it too late to be an
unsolved Mystery? Alls I had to do was walk away…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Brigitte F.! Brigitte looks up to see a
cheap plastic Frankenstein mask looking down at her. Its owner flips it
up: it’s Sam. Brigitte’s eyes snap wide open in shock.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They let me go. No evidence: someone called in
this tip.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: So I decided to stay.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Hey, you gotta get outta here -/ Ginger
emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva, and the room stops dead.
Brigitte drops her glass of punch. Ginger has come out as herself, as an
almost full-blown werewolf. She wears a Lill Red Riding Hood cape jobbie
and a plastic mask. She’s the best looking monster you ever laid eyes
on. Down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing and everything.
The room bursts into a_cheerinq round of applause.</p>
<p><strong>gus.’ with ‘ax in the head’</strong>: That make-up is
amazing!</p>
<p><strong>guy with ‘eye missing’</strong>: Ginger, it looks totally
real!</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Told you. She’s a arts-type, for chrissakes,
look at that.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: She’s very good, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wow, yer sister’s gone to town.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Yeah, she’s gone all right. Hey. can you
do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Can you give somethin’ to Ginger for me?
Jus’ - we’re Navin’ a fight, but I got this thing for her.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, what. Brigitte shows him what appears to
be a joint. Sam takes it.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: Don’t tell her I gave it to you. Jus’
act like it’s from you. She won’t take it if it’s from me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: An, don’t like, go any wheres with her.
Okay? Jus’ come right back, ’kay?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gonna miss me Bee F.? Brigitte smiles,
embarrassed and freaking at the exact same time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: one minute young lady, I could use a little
help here.</p>
<p><strong>br i g itte</strong>: Let go of me, I have to get Ginger!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I have to get two more veggie trays down
those stairs. I think your sister’ 11 be fine for two minutes. Pamela is
already marching Brigitte up the stairs. Brigitte strains to get back.
Looking between her mother and her closed bedroom door, desperately.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: All these boys came to see you two, least
you can do is stop hiding in your room. Honestly, you act like someone’d
forced this party down your throat. Now go be nice. Pamela stands
between Brigitte and the bedroom door, her arms folded.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Mother. You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Yes–I do. I was shy too at your age.
Mingle.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: okay, cut it out now.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: This dope’s fucked. Makin’ me blaarrggh.
C’mon. I’ll do ya.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No thanks. Told yer sister I’d be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: What’s up your ass?!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t get mean, s’nothin’ personal. I happen to
think Brigitte’s pretty cool. and -/</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Leave my baby sister alone. Do me, don’t
hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I won’t hurt her. Now be a good girl and finish
up your joint.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: oh. Well fuck you. Ginger takes a big toke
as she paces between Sam and the door. Suddenly she’s coughing
uncontrollably, rubbing her eyes, wailing in pain.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Burning! What is this?! Sam makes a move
toward her and Ginger blindly lashes out at him. Ginger hurls Sam into
the bed. Sam’s flight path knocks the mattress askew: dozens and dozens
of dog collars pour out over him. Sam fingers one in particular.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Morely -?!</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Something was definitely fucked. Brigitte
eyes Pamela, who is slowly being distracted by horny young men who will
now dance with anybody, even Pamela.</p>
<p><strong>cow guy</strong>: Do you think this is a faggy costume for a
guy? You can just say. I dunno I been gettin’ funny looks. What, like we
aren’t advanced enough that a guy can show up completely in the spirit
of the thing with an udder, an’ not get treated like a freakin’ fruit?
Brigitte looks at her watch. Pamela is dragged off into the throng by a
band of juveniles singing Do The Hustle. Brigitte makes her move at
last.</p>
<p><strong>cow guy</strong>: snob. Brigitte makes a badly-faked would-be
casual bee-line for their bedroom door. Brigitte wiggles the knob. It’s
locked.</p>
<p><strong>tnt girls’ bedroom - night</strong>: Brigitte unlocks the
door and peers in. The light is on in the bathroom, the door is ajar.
The shower is running. There are a few candles burning in corners.
otherwise the room is dark. Brigitte steps inside, closing the door on
the party behind her. She grabs a flashlight and turns it on. The walls
are splattered with blood. There is gore on the floor. Brigitte plucks
the monkshead joint from a pool of bloody goo - it is soaked.
Useless.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: You bitch! Brigitte discovers Ginger
sitting in the tub floor under the running shower, weeping. Her eyes are
swollen. Ginger is now covered in coarse hair. The water around her is
full of blood. There is a kitchen knife next to her. Ginger’s stoned
numb on the monkshood dose. She’s groggy and weak.</p>
<p><strong>br ig itte</strong>: oh fuck ! Ginger is squeezing her now
full tail at its base, where the blood is oozing between her f..inger.s.
Ginger has tried - and tailed - to euL her tail off.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Oh no. Oh no. Fuck, fuck! Ginger doesn’t
move. Ginger looks so pathetic, it’s heart- breaking. Brigitte snatches
the knife away and shuts off the water.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Nobody’ll want me now any ways. Sc. Brigitte
takes in the cut, the rest of the monstrosity her sister has become.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I don’t wanna do this any more. Brigitte
yanks Ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel, frantic.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Press this on the cut! Ginger! Move,
c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I missed you Bee. I’m sorry. Brigitte
searches Ginger’s face.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginge’? That you in there? Ginger cracks
an uncertain, pained smile. Brigitte does too, an exact replica, in
fact.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Ya feeb. Brigitte gently turns Ginger around
to try and deal with her tail. Ginger is woozy and weak from blood
loss.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: okay. I can’t clean this one up. We have
to go. Like Go, go. Can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: I’m so woozy. Brigitte glances out into the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Um. Ever bite something you din’t
kill?</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: No. Wanna be one with me?</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ah. No. Sam? Isn’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>ginger</strong>: Oooh nooo.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Don’t worry. Keep pressing. T’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Hey. Sorry. I really did think you were.
Like. Not bad. So you know, whatever. Any ways. I’m really sorry - I
have to. Sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her. Brigitte blinks away
tears and looks away, collecting herself. Brigitte raises the bat over
her head and swings it down as</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Girls? You in there? You’re not being very
sociable… There’s no answer. She tries the knob, and is surprised to
find it unlocked. She opens the door. She turns on the lights. Pamela
takes in the bloody muck everywhere. The room is deserted. No Sam. No
sisters Fitzgerald. Just gore. Pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight
to the floor. Henry rushes up, looking in over his wife’s body. The boys
in costume crowd in behind him.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Pamela, honey, it’s just a prank, you know
how they…</p>
<p>****: Holy mother of - it’s warm. Where are my kids?!!</p>
<p><strong>guy with ax in the head</strong>: Ginger went in here with
Sam McDonald a while back.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Sam McDonald?</p>
<p><strong>guy with eye missing</strong>: Yeah, you know. The guy they
thought was the Beast, but they let ’im go. Henry steps into the room.
He spots a bloody trail up to the open ground-level window.</p>
<p><strong>ext fitzgerald home - night</strong>: Tires squeal in the
street and the county regreening truck lurches out of its parking
spot.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Plans, plans arc good. ’Course I hardly
had one. Adrenaline though, adrenaline is pretty speedy shit.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger?! Don’t eat the body okay? I got
this idea, an’ we’ll need Sam. Brigitte floors it and the truck blasts
down their cul du sac to the main road.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Fuck, fuck fuck, FUCK.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ha! All rightie then. Brigitte drives on.
What she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses of Ginger
in the flickering lights of the passing street lamps. Her final spurt of
transformation is taking place: FLASH! Her face is filling in with fur.
FLASH! Her eyes glow golden, yellow, wolfen. FLASH! Her face pulls into
a wet snout. FLASH! A long pink tongue lolls out between glistening
white fangs.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: okay, Ginger? They’ll think that Sam took
us from our room, right? ’Cause of his record an, the arrest, right?
We’re gonna make this look like he did, any ways. He got us, maybe
killed us, took our bodies to do some unspeakable thingy. But then? Sam
killed himself. You follow? Ginger doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: So boom, diversion. Meanwhile you an, me
hit the highway. we can hitch, get you cleaned up. By the time the find
out we weren’t in Sam’s clutches at all, we could be any wheres. Yeah?
Whatcha think? Ginger doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: It’ll work. Brigitte puts the brake on but
does not cut the engine.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Ginger? C’mon, we got move. Shove Sam down
here. Brigitte climbs up into the truck, reaching for something on its
floor. Brigitte f itids Sam’s prone feet. An animal/Ginger launches out
at her, knocking her back, out, clear of the truck. Ginger isn’t Ginger
any more - what we can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a
creature much like the one that bit Ginger. And it’s attacking Brigitte.
Brigitte flails, kicks and punches at it. She breaks free and clambers
at the tool rack on the inside panel of the truck. She grabs a shovel as
the creature comes snarling up at her.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Stop. I mean it. It lunges at her again
and Brigitte clocks it. It slides, dazed, off the back of the truck to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>jump to:</strong>: Brigitte drags Sam’s body into the front
seat. She sets her Adidas bag on the gas pedal. She releases the brake.
The truck rolls forward. off the top of the hill. Brigitte watches as it
crashes down, down, rolling and twisting into the suburb below. It lands
in a heap and bursts into flames.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Nice one. Brigitte returns to where
It/Ginger was last seen on the ground. The shovel and blanket are there.
A bloody pool trails off into the woods. Brigitte hefts the shovel
warily, shoulders the blanket, and follows the wetness shining in the
moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>brigitte</strong>: Fuck Ginger. Leave a fuckin’ trail much?
