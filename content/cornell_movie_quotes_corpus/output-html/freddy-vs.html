<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Keep ’em closed. Are they closed? They
better be closed.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They’re closed!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Ta-da!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I hope you like it! But I left the tags on
in case you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, I love it. You look – wait, where are
the tags?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I gotta rewind the fire.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You want to set a mood, why don’t you put in
that other tape we rented?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason! I want everything to be perfect, like
I always dreamed it would be – a big fire, a bottle of champagne, and
the quarterback of the football team.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You know I’m just second-string.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: That’s okay. So’s the champagne.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, haven’t you had enough?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: That’s weird. I thought my mother was out of
town tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: She is. That’s why you invited me over.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Damn right. I’m sick of making out in the
back of your car. Let’s do it in the back of my mom’s car.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I have a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I think you better get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What?… No, we have to… I got all sexy for
you…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You know, we don’t have to return the fire
until Monday. Maybe we can try again…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What’re you staring at, you big perve?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Come on. Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Guess again.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jason can’t help you now.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jason is dead!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What do you want?!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I want you to die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: You’ve reached the Daniels residence.
Please leave a message.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This is Westec Security. We’re getting a
system failure on your unit…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Help me! Please!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Ma’am, is everything–</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wake up, Lizzie.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Wake up before you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get my gun. P-l-e-a-s-e!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: For God’s sake, shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t kill Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: YOU CAN’T KILL FEAR!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Jesus Christ! Do something!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Down on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I said down on the ground!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>attacker</strong>: This isn’t over, Lizzie. Freddy wants you
dead!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Freddy?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Why did he pick me? I’ve never seen this guy
before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: He knew your name. Maybe you just didn’t get
a good enough look. It was dark, you were hysterical, he was wearing a
mask. We really need you to take another look at him.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What? He’s in the next room? No!</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Lizzie, please. This is very important.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Still can’t reach the mom, Sheriff, but we
found the boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, my God. Is he alright? Is he alive?</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Dammit, Reese! I’m trying to conduct a
police investigation here. You don’t just barge–</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Is he okay?!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m fine. Everything’s going to be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What happened to you? I thought you were
dead!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I was downstairs in the kitchen making you my
hangover remedy and you were out of aspirin and Tabasco so I walked over
to Todd’s…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: I’m sorry, your friends have to wait
outside.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: No, please. I don’t want to be alone with…
him.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He can’t see me, can he?</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s a one-way mirror.</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: He says his name is Dominic Necros. That
ring anything?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: For Christ’s sake, I’d remember a face like
that. Now, turn it off, I can’t look at him anymore!</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Okay, according to the report, he told you
that… uh… “Freddy wants you dead.” Now, who’s Freddy? Ex- boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I think he means Freddy Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Mmm hmm. You have any idea why this Krueger
would want you dead?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He doesn’t. He’s just a movie character.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: This nut-job is copying Freddy Krueger. You
know, Nightmare On Elm Street? Bastard son of a thousand maniacs, burned
to death by angry parents? Seeks revenge on teenagers?</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: The guy in the hockey mask.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, that’s Jason Voorhees. Friday The 13th.
Retarded kid who drowned at summer camp. Seeks revenge on teen- agers.
They’re completely different characters.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Sheriff, we ran the name and prints through
the computer… nothing. But get this: his M.O. matches seven unsolved
murders throughout the country. All teenagers… all cut wide open… by
five parallel blades.</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>batson</strong>: I wouldn’t worry, Lizzie. We’ll just let the
FBI take over from here… Yeah, they’ll know what to do. They… um… uh…
Could you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Okay, then. You all have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Freddy is real!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: You’re scared, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: That’s good! Your fear is what brings him
here!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: I wouldn’t go to sleep tonight if I were
you. I’d never sleep again!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Stainmaster, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>carpet guy</strong>: That’s not coming out. Not that much
blood. Not out of a white carpet.</p>
<p><strong>carpet guy</strong>: Ram�n, Jes�s – don’t waste your time.
We’re gonna have to replace the whole thing. And the padding.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Can you believe the cops don’t clean
up after a murder? I mean, half these footprints are theirs.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Daniels.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Jason, thank God it’s you and not
another goddamn news crew.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I missed the news cameras? Life is so
unfair.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie, honey, your friends came by to
cheer– Sam, get your freakin’ hands off the walls.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: So, you like what I’ve done with the
place?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, my God. Are you okay? You look
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Beth, please! Of course she looks terrible.
You have any idea what she’s been through?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Uh, ladies? I said take her mind off the
attack.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Good luck. Mom, we’re going outside – I
gotta get out of this house. Have you called the real estate woman
yet?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Mmm hmm. That dead guard knocked
twenty percent off our resale value. Looks like we’re stuck here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s not coming out.</p>
<p><strong>carpet guy</strong>: Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay, Dad. See you at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Man, that rent-a-cop didn’t stand a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: If he had a gun, why didn’t he use it?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: It got knocked out of his hands. He couldn’t
get to it. He couldn’t… do anything.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Jeez, Lizzie, you must’ve been scared
shitless.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The thing is, you never know what you’re gonna
do in a situation like that until it happens.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: But if it were me, I would’ve kicked that
freak right in the balls. Yeah, that’s what I would’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Let’s hope you never have to find out.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You are so lucky you missed the English
mid-term. An essay on Madame Bovary’s descent into madness – okay, I
think I aced that – but the multiple choice section was a real killer.
Oops, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Lizzie?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’m okay… It’s just… I haven’t really slept
since– I hear the cat scratching at the door in the middle of the night
and I just know it’s “The Masked Psycho” coming to get me.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Lizzie, Dominic Necros is in jail. And he’s
not getting out.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah, I wouldn’t worry about “The Masked
Psycho”. Or at least the “mask” part.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: How the hell did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I snagged it at the jail while Dominic was
going apeshit. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’ve got to give that back. It’s evidence or
something.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, we gotta keep it. That way, the next time
Lizzie sees this face, she’ll know it’s the real Freddy, and not some
copycat.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, but I wouldn’t worry about Mr. Frederic
J. Krueger. I’ve seen all the movies. First of all, he can only get you
in your nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That’s why the girl in the movie is always
like… I don’t want to go to sleep. Don’t let me fall asleep!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: That’s not why I haven’t been sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know, I know. We’re just fucking around here.
But she falls asleep anyway. And then Freddy comes. Because she’s
afraid. And fear is what brings him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But seriously, if Freddy does come after
you…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just turn around and tell him you’re not
scared… You don’t scare me, Freddy Krueger! And he’ll go away.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I thought I saw something.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Let’s see, we got well, medium well, and,
well… burnt.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Not with that fork. It’s got ass on it.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’ll take the burnt one, but I’m gonna need a
whole lot of ketchup. Lizzie…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, my God! He’s out there!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: There’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Dominic?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Maybe you should go inside and lie down?
You’re gonna have to sleep sooner or later…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He’s here! I know it!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, don’t do this to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You wanna put something on the news? How
’bout these?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You’re not going to sleep. You’re gonna stay
up all night keeping watch… standing guard… not going anywhere… even to
pee–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, I’m not going anywhere. Except to
pee.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Promise you’ll never leave me again?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Cross your heart and hope to die?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Cross my heart and hope to die.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Did you lock the front door?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Did you set the alarm?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Did you lock the bedroom door?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We weren’t doing any–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie, I want to talk to you about
protection.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: It’s your Uncle Al’s. He wants you to
keep it in your room.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Are you crazy? Forget it!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Better a gun in the house than a
serial killer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Al’s gonna come by and teach us how to
use it. He says it’s just like the camera he bought you for Christ- mas
– point and shoot.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Good night, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: ’Night, Mrs. Daniels.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: What? You thought I was gonna let you
sleep up here? Let’s go, stud, on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason, you promised!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You heard your mother. I’m on the couch. Meet
me down there as soon as she’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason, are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You’re not asleep now.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: But you are!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Welcome to your nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t fight.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Your arms are useless.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t escape.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason! For God’s sake, where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’re going to die in this house!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Go ahead… try to run! I control this
world!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jason can’t help you, Lizzie. No one can.
It’s just you and me. And one of us is going to die.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>dr. adams</strong>: Lizzie, it’s okay. You’re safe here.
Lizzie?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: The same dream night after night, all
week. She wakes up screaming her head off. She’s not getting any sleep.
Please tell me you can help.</p>
<p><strong>dr. adams</strong>: Mrs. Daniels, all our tests indicate
normal brain function. There is nothing wrong with your daughter…
physically. That’s why I’ve asked Dr. Rubin to join us.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: I’m the clinic’s Chief of Psychiatry.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You think I’m fucking crazy?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: We don’t like to use that word around
here. Crazy. You can say “fucking” all you want.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: Lizzie, nightmares are perfectly normal.
It’s the way your subconscious works through trauma.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You think this is normal? This time he cut
me!</p>
<p><strong>dr. adams</strong>: You cut yourself when you woke up. Nobody
can hurt you in your dream.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He cut me, Doctor. I went to sleep and
Freddy Krueger tried to kill me. And then Jason Voorhees tried to kill
him. It doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: Oh, but it does. You were attacked by a
man pretending to be Freddy Krueger. This leaves you feeling helpless
and vulnerable, so you dream up another monster to protect you, who just
happens to have the same name as your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Yeah, that’s all very interesting. Now can
you make the nightmares stop?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: No. Only you can. By learning how to
control your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: I’m researching a new drug called
Somnambulene. It’s a ketamine derivative that increases delta wave
function in the brain to maximize Stage 3 sleep– In English – it puts
you in the perfect dream state and keeps you there all night.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’m not gonna take that. Why would I want to
be trapped in my nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: Because until this subconscious battle
plays itself out, your night- mares will never end.</p>
<p><strong>dr. adams</strong>: We’ve had good results with it so far,
and the side effects are relatively minor.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: How minor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: The usual. Headache, dryness of mouth,
nausea, and… uh…</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: A few of the patients in our clinic who
took Somnambulene reported… well, they thought they could share each
others’ dreams.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: That sounds fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. adams</strong>: You have to remember, the subjects were
severely sleep deprived. Most likely they were hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>dr. rubin</strong>: Statistically, you have a far greater
chance of suffering severe diarrhea than you do of “sharing dreams”. I
wouldn’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Why won’t you take the pills? They
said it will help. Is it the diarrhea?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: It’s everything – the nightmares, the
attack, the house… I hate it here!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie, you can’t just run away from
your problems. They always catch up with you. Unless you’re your father,
who hasn’t sent a child support check in four years.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I just– I can’t go to sleep. I don’t wanna
die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie, would you listen to yourself?
Nothing’s going to happen to you. You are not going to die. But you are
going to take this pill.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: You’ll see, everything will be better
in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: If I’m still here in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Sweet dreams, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Uh… Good night.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You did the right thing. You don’t need your
mom and her drugs. You’ve got us and our drugs.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Incoming!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: What’d your mom say when you told her you
were leaving?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, she doesn’t care… She’s, um, out for the
night.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: So where we headed?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: We could go to the beach and drink.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That’s so junior high. Let’s go to the desert.
I’ve always wanted to drink in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Forget it. I’ve got a better idea.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Your dad is gonna go wall to wall on your ass
when he finds out you took one of his vans.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hell, he’ll miss the beer before he misses the
van.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look at this place!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hope the water’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: We can go skinny dipping!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Any excuse to take off your top.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s why I love her.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You love me?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Uh– I’m gonna go check the water.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason, of all the places we could have gone…
a lake?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Um… my nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yeah, I know. And in your nightmares, the
lake is where you run when you’re scared, right? It’s where you go to be
saved…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: By Jason.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Go long!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You almost took my head off.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Whoa, guys, check this out!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Screw the tents. Why don’t we stay here?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Shit. It’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Try it now.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’ll look for a generator.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, watch out for Dominic Necros.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Dammit, Jason!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What? I can’t kiss you anymore?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: We have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Come on, Lizzie, it’s just a little rain.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You don’t understand… I’ve been here before…
In my nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, don’t start.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Every time I go to sleep, Freddy Krueger
tries to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He chases me out of the house… to a lake… a
lake just like this one.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: And every night, right as Freddy is about to
kill me… Jason comes out of the lake and saves me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Way to go, man!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Not me. Jason Voorhees.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The guy from Halloween?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Friday the 13th.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Impossible. Jason died in the last sequel.
Again. And the only way to reanimate him is with a human heart.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We forgot to pack the human heart. Hey, Beth,
check the cooler.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Why are you telling us this? I don’t want to
be here anymore. Take me home.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Come on. Lizzie’s fucking with us. It’s just a
ghost story.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh. Yeah… I’m sorry. Just… trying to scare
you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Pills. I saw them. Lizzie has pills!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You holding out on us?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are they, Roofies? They don’t look like
Roofies.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: It’s Somnambulene. Some kind of
keta-something derivative.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ketamine? Special K? You’ve got Special K?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You didn’t tell me they gave you Special K.
Pass ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I don’t think so. This is pretty heavy duty
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: There are side effects. You know, like
headaches… dry mouth…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: And, um, well… some people who took them
thought… they could share each others’ dreams.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t have to make shit up. If you’re not
gonna give us any, just say so.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’m not gonna give you any.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Buzzkill.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: My jewels!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Alright, who’s touching my ass?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh. Sorry. I thought you were Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You don’t know my ass from a guy’s?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh. Sorry. I thought you were Sam.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It’s alive! Alive! I call it “Flaming Piss”!
Watch your eyebrows, ladies. Sam, turn the lights back on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: To Lizzie!</p>
<p><strong>friends</strong>: To Lizzie!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Ecch. This tastes terrible. How much piss
did you put in it?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, I ran out. So I had to use beer,
tequila, grain alcohol, Mountain Dew–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And don’t forget the secret ingredient…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I spiked the drinks with your…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Som– Somnambulene.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jesus, Sam! You don’t know when to quit. You
always–</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, that was my beer!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: This isn’t funny, guys!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m melting!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I can’t feel my… my…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Face.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Why are you laughing?! We’re in deep
shit!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What if Dominic Necros turned off the
lights? What if he followed us here? We’ve got to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Come on, Lizzie. The drugs are just making you
paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Just because I’m paranoid doesn’t mean
Dominic’s not coming to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh, God. We’re sitting ducks. What’re we
going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We’re going to sit back and enjoy the ride.
When we wake up tomorrow, everything will be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, my God. He’s here! He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Shit! Where are Sam and Todd?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Uh… out by the generator, fucking with us?
Again.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’ll take a look.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Absolutely not. Don’t leave me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Hmmm. We can all stay here in the dark, or,
uh… you can come with me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Must be the drugs.</p>
<p><strong>jason voorhees</strong>: You fucked up my boombox, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You shoved me through the wall, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Jesus, guys, you scared the shit out of me.
You think this is funny? You think Lizzie needs this right now?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: We were trying to scare you, not Lizzie.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, we’re not totally insensitive. Just a
little. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Yeah, you’re sorry all right. That’s why you
brought those masks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, I only brought the Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: This Jason stuff, we found up here.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come here, I’ll prove it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I found the mask right here…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And the machete was sticking out of the
skull.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What skull?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This one.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, wait a minute. You don’t think… I remember
someone telling me Friday the 13th was based on a true story. Maybe
we’ve stumbled on the very summer camp where Jason Voorhees actually
mutilated all those teen- age–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s enough, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Here? It happened here?!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But if it did, that means Lizzie’s dream… has
come true.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But… um… but that’s okay… because Jason’s here
to protect you from Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, wait.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It’s just one of Sam’s jokes. Just trying to
be funny. It’s not even a real skull.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, it is. And it’s not mine.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Come on, Lizzie. Why don’t we go back
inside?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They’re just having fun… you know, trying to
cheer you up–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: –in their own fucked-up way.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You have no idea what I’ve been through.
That guard. He died because of me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No, he died protecting you. He died doing his
job. It sucks, but it’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Look, I never told you this – his gun was
right in front of me. I could have grabbed it, killed Dominic Necros,
and this would all be over. But I didn’t. I just stood there.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Lizzie, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Aw, shit.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know. You wanna make out?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You’re buying me a new radio. There, I said
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …a country-wide manhunt is on for
suspected serial killer Dominic Necros…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Shh! Turn it up!</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: …escaped early this morning while
being transferred to FBI custody, killing two sheriff’s deputies and
a–</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Holy Mother of God! Lizzie was right!
Dominic is on his way up here. He’s going to kill us. All of us. You
guys first, then me. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We gotta get out of here. I’ll get Lizzie and
Jason.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You scared the shit out of me!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You passed out. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I’d feel a lot better if you got rid of that
goddamn mask.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m sorry, Lizzie. I fucked up. I’m fucked
up. Both.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Yeah, I’m sorry, too. I’m sorry I got
attacked, I’m sorry I have nightmares, I’m sorry I jump ten feet in the
air every time you kiss me on the neck. And I’m sorry… but right now I
need a boyfriend I can count on… someone who makes me feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You can count on me, Lizzie, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cross your heart and hope to die?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I don’t think so!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Jason can’t help you, Lizzie. It’s just you
and me now. And one of us is going to die.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: This can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Why are you so surprised? Freddy controls
everything. He brought you here. He brought me here. It’s just like your
nightmare, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: C’mon, open the door! It’s me! Open the
goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Open the goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Beth! Beth! C’mon, Beth! Come out of it!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Turn her over so she doesn’t choke on her
vomit.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: She’s not gonna Hendrix. She’s just having a
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve never seen Beth like this before… and she
does a lot of drugs.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Lizzie! Where’s Lizzie?! We’ve gotta– what,
but– how did I get inside?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You never left. It’s okay. You were having a
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: You went to warn Lizzie about Dominic. But
you passed out before you got to the door.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You never could hold your Flaming Piss.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: But I… How…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Whoa. That’s so fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Lizzie, we’ve got to get out of here!
Dominic escaped. Where’s Jason?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He’s dead. Dominic killed him!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He ripped out Jason’s heart and then he
tried to kill me. I can’t take this anymore!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Stay calm. Stay calm! STAY–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We’ve gotta get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: How? Dominic’s right outside.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit, you’re right!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let’s go. Everything that’s not nailed
down.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Faster!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: How far away is he, Lizzie?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He’s by the lake. That’s where I got away…
and only because–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I smashed him in the face with a rock.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What are you talking about? You never left the
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: No, she was there with me. She saved my
life.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, she was here with us… having a
nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: It wasn’t a nightmare! It was real. Beth hit
him with the rock, then–</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Then Jason’s heart went flying in the
lake!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I got cornered on a dock, and then…</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: What, Lizzie, what?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason Voorhees came out of the lake.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jason Voorhees?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Cool it, Sam. Jason Voorhees is just a movie
character. He isn’t real. You know that. You must have blacked out and
had a nightmare – just like Beth.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: But… no… we couldn’t both have the same
nightmare. Unless…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie/beth</strong>: The Somnambulene.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, my God. We shared a dream.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I thought you made up all that side effect shit
up, you know, to scare us off.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It really works? Awesome!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Wait a minute… If it was all a dream, that
means… Dominic’s still in jail!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: And Jason’s still alive!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Lizzie, I’ve got some bad news. I don’t want
you to freak out…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But you’re gonna.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Dominic really did escape from jail.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: What?! Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Dead sure. We never went to sleep. We heard it
on the radio. Before Sam busted it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Would you stop it with the fucking radio
already? I said I’d buy you a new one.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No, you didn’t. I said you’d buy me a new
one.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Shut up! There’s a serial killer on the
loose and he’s got a hard-on for Lizzie. And we’re in the middle of
nowhere… no phones, no police, no one to hear us scream…</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Why would you say that?!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: IT’S TRUE!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I KNOW!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: WE’VE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay. Here’s what we do.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You go find Jason. He’s probably passed out
somewhere. We’ll pack up here and meet you at the van.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jesus, it’s really coming down out there. How
’bout we pack, you go get Jason?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Just take your “umbrella”, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You don’t really think Dominic will find us up
here, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, if he does… I hope he drinks lite beer,
’cause that’s all we got left.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Take it easy, man. You gotta drive.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh-uh. Not me. Too drunk.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, not me. I’m wasted.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah? I’m trashed.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m ripped.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sloshed.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m fried.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m… …inebriated.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’m… You win. I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Screw it, let’s make Jason drive. You and me
will crash in the back of the van and dream-share at two- on-one with
Marnie.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You want to nail my girlfriend? With me
watching?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh… um…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, look…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s Jason.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Did he see us?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t think so. Let’s scare the shit out of
him.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You got a plan?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know… jump out, say “boo”?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Good plan.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Freddy or not, here I come…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What’s taking them so long?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Something’s wrong. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Would you stop saying things like that!
You’re scaring me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: We’re gonna die here.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Come on, Lizzie, just keep it together a
little longer. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: He’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, man, quit putzing around, we gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: We just heard on the radio that Dominic broke
out of jail. Lizzie’s pretty freaked out. So we figured we’d better take
the party somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Oh, and by the way, you’re driving. Me and Sam
are too… inebriated.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What the hell, one more wouldn’t kill you…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, watch it, dickhead!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Aaaagggghhh!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Think you can make it back to the cabin?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No big deal. It’s just the generator, right?
Everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I thought I heard someone scream.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That was you.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: No… Outside!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I heard it, too.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Stop it. Both of you. You’re scared and you’re
making Marnie scared and that just makes you more scared and now… I’m
getting scared.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: You should be.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Please… don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Kill you? I’m not going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: I had my chance. Now it’s someone else’s
turn.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: You’re about to take a trip. A Som-
nambulene trip. To meet my master. FREDDY KRUEGER!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Dominic, so glad you could make it. We weren’t
sure if you’d be able to find us.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You know, we’re all pretty beat, and I’m sure
you are too, so why don’t we just do the whole murder thing in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Stop it, Todd! He’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Who, this guy? I wouldn’t worry about it. Oh,
mmm, Lizzie? I just bumped into your boyfriend. You were right. He’s
dead. Someone tore out his heart.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Oh, my God! No!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Now, I’m not pointing any fingers, but…
Dominic?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: I killed him and I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Sure you will. Hold that thought.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Beth, I’m glad you’re sitting down. Uh… how do
I put this… Sam just got his head cut off by Jason Voorhees.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Todd, what are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’m doing… I’m sleeping.
Right now. We all are. Don’t you get it, Lizzie? We passed out when we
took the Somnambulene and we’ve been sharing a dream ever since! I mean,
how else can you explain Dominic finding us?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Freddy sent me.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Uh huh. All a dream.</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: That’s right. None of this is really
happening. This is all a dream. Tell that to Lizzie’s doctor, who’s
lying all over a hospital floor right now…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, Somnambulene! That is some crazy shit!
Now, Dominic, did you bring enough for everybody?</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: Don’t worry. You’ll get your chance to meet
Freddy Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Ooooo, you’re going to send me to “Nightmare
World”? No! You can’t send me there! You know why? ’Cause it doesn’t
exist. And neither does Freddy Krueger!</p>
<p><strong>dominic</strong>: You’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Hey, everybody, look who’s here! It’s Jason
Voorhees!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Todd, stay back!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Why? He’s not so tough. I’ve had worse
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: No, no, no, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hold still. Hold still!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: I don’t want to share a dream with him! I
can’t… I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: One, two, Freddy’s comin’ for you. Three,
four, better lock your door…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One, two, Freddy’s coming for you!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Jason, there you are!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ready to play the Nightmare Game?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Nooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You got into little Jason’s dreams. You
found out our secret.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Poor Jason. Stumbling around the lake all
these years… The mind- less sleepwalker… killing victim after victim.
Every time he looks at them, he sees only me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: He was my first, you know. But there have
been so many more.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And you’re next!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: That’s it… Wake up… Please don’t be mental.
Please!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think she’s okay. Let’s try to move her
now.</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Okay, that’s good. Can you stand, Lizzie?
We’ve gotta get out of here. We’ve gotta get to the van.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Fuck it, I’ll carry her.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: No, wait! He’s drowning!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Good, let him!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: We’ve got to wake him up!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Are you crazy? If he wakes up, he’ll kill us
all! Move!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: It’s not his fault!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: WAKE UP! WAKE UP!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: “It’s not his fault! Wake him up!” Great
fucking idea, Lizzie!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You should have let him die! You should have
let him die!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh, my God! Todd, no! No!!!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason, stop!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Stop. You don’t want to kill us. You want to
kill Freddy Krueger. I know what he did to you.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Everywhere you look you see him.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Beth, no!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: RUN!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Open the door! Move it!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Fuck, fuck, fuck…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: Oh, no… no… please… start!</p>
<p><strong>marnie</strong>: I can’t. It won’t–</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Marnie!!! No!!!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Drive!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: We’re stuck!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Just get us the fuck away from here!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What the hell are you doing? We’re almost out
of here. We’re almost safe!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: We’ll never be safe… not as long as Freddy’s
alive.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Lizzie, please, can we talk about this

<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: You can help me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason?! Jason?!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie! Thank God! I’ve been worried
sick about you. I went to your room, but you were gone, I didn’t know
where… Do you know how long it took me to find you here?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: How did you find me here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Did you hear that? Lizzie, I’m scared.
What is this horrible place?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Let go of me! Let go…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. daniels</strong>: Lizzie, please! Stop it! Why are you
doing this to me? To your own mother!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You should be.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You shouldn’t have come.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Think he’ll protect you?…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …Never!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Don’t touch her!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: She’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t kill your fear!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Remember our game? The nightmare game…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: First I scare you…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: …Then you die!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Help him. He’s drowning!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: How many people have to die because of
you?</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You can’t do this! I control the
nightmares!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: This is my nightmare. And in my nightmare,
Freddy does feel pain. In my nightmare, Freddy bleeds!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: And in my nightmare, JASON WINS!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: This is where my nightmare ends… and yours
begins!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: TAKE HIM TO YOUR WORLD, JASON!</p>
<p><strong>lizzie</strong>: Welcome to your nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I can feel your heart beating faster, Jason.
Are you afraid?</p>

<p><strong>special report – cops v.s. the cult – day 13. a</strong>:
NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In the background,
dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN surround a small run-down, two-story
house… Freddy’s house.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: As the sun rises on yet another
morning, still no end in sight for the standoff between police and the
mysterious group known only as the “Freddy” cult who seized the
abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago. These cultists –
mostly run- away teenagers – have managed to keep police at bay for
almost two weeks while inside they take mind- altering narcotics in
order to communicate with their god – Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Morning, Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast is
almost ready!</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
was released on a legal technicality but later burned to death at the
hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents. Some years later, a rash
of bizarre and unexplainable teen- age deaths began leaving many in the
area to wonder… is Freddy really dead?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Hurry up and eat. You don’t want to be
late for special school.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Mom! Don’t call it that!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I hate that school. The other kids are mean…
and they’re all re- tard-ed!</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: We don’t use that word. They’re
“special” children just like you’re “special”.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: The cult members have declined to an
on-camera interview but did send out a note with a message. The note –
which, by the way, appears to have been written in blood – reads… To the
parents of Springwood – Freddy lives! Soon he will come and take one of
your children as his virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP- and his
-BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and -BEEP- and behold, a soulless child shall be
born. The vessel for Freddy to rise and rule the darkness forever and
ever.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That’s Jesse. Let’s go, Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Oh, look at the time! I’ve got to be
going… anyone need me to bring anything home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I need an alarm clock.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: What’s wrong with your old one?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Broke.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: We’re almost out of vodka.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Good morning! Hey, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: My mom…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I had another dream last night…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Was I naked?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No. You were Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Jason? Oh, yeech… Was I any good?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Do you have to watch that crap all the
time? Months and months of the O.J. Simpson trial, and now this…</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: I’m standing here with State Trooper
Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the Governor has called in to deal with
the cultists because of his past experience with occult-style murderers.
In fact, Trooper Murdoch is the only law enforcement officer ever to
survive a one-on-one encounter with notorious Camp Crystal Lake killer –
Jason Voorhees. You received some pretty nasty injuries in your battle
with Jason, didn’t you, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Nothing serious… just a few stitches.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: What about these so called “Freddy”
cultists? They seem like pretty tough customers. Think you’ll have any
trouble getting them out of there?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: No. Now that the Governor has given me
complete authority to deal with these punks I should be putting an end
to their situation pretty quick. Unless of course their attorney is able
to get them to come out peace- fully… but I don’t hold out much hope for
that.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
gentlemen. A tough cop… for tough criminals.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Damn media… oughtta be a law. Is that
shyster still in there trying to talk them out?</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Yeah… he’s making them some kind
of deal.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Damn lawyers… what a bunch of assholes.
Shakespeare was right – kill all the lawyers. Then we could kill all the
punks with no hassles and the world would be a safer place.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Smaller anyway.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Ahhhhh… what did Shakespeare know?
Long-haired, English freak. He was probably a punk.</p>
<p><strong>sleazy lawyer</strong>: So, as I explained to you before, the
revenues between the TV movie deal and the book sale should be adequate
to fund your joint-defense. And I think with my mass media hypnosis
argument I could get each of you a reduced sentence on appeal – say…
twenty years each. Out in fifteen with good behavior? Hmmmmm?</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Hold your fire!</p>
<p><strong>little girl hostage</strong>: Help me, mister… please.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Hang on, honey… I’ll have you
out of there in a second.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Looks like we’ll have to hunt the rest of
them down. Let’s go before they get too far.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: We can’t leave! Can’t you see
we’ve got a situation here?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Leave her.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: You’re crazy! I can’t just leave
her!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Forget it. I’ve seen this before. There’s
nothing you can do.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: I’ve got to try…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: You’re wasting your time.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Punks.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Are you okay, honey?</p>
<p><strong>little girl hostage</strong>: Freddy lives!</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Jesus… you were going to kill
that kid, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: I told you you were wasting your time. Once
these kids go rabid, best thing to do is put ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: You can’t be serious…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Dead serious. See… the world is made up of
rules. Kids don’t like rules. They rebel for a while, but ultimately
they start to fall in line and become ordinary Joe’s like you and me.
But some kids… dope smokers mainly, watching their MTV… Satanic lyrics
melting what’s left of their brains… these kids grow up to be punks. And
when these punks step as far over the line as these “Freddy” punks have
– then we as peace officers have no choice but to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: I didn’t become a peace officer
to kill kids.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Punks. There’s a difference… …barely.</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: Meagan!?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Yes, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: I asked if you were ready to give your
oral report?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Yes… I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: Please come up here to the podium.</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: You won’t think it’s funny when you
haven’t learned the fundamentals of a free market economy… oh, why do I
waste my breath? You’re all going to grow up to be gas station
attendants and waitresses anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: My report is on Global Economic Trends. Try
and think of a world where there is no poverty… no sickness… no crime. A
world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in
peace. This is my dream.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: This dream is becoming a reality with
ever-growing international business…</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: Louder, Meagan. We can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: Louder, Meagan… we still can’t hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Aww… all dressed up and nowhere to blow!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse… please, help me.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Looks like a photo opportunity to me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Say… cheesecake!</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: Meagan? Meagan?!</p>
<p><strong>miss krepps</strong>: I asked if you were ready to give your
report?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you know
where you are?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I was day dreaming and then I woke up but
then it was like I was still dreaming and then I woke up and then I
guess I fainted and now I’m awake again…</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: Meagan?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I’m waiting to see if you’re going to turn
into Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: Freddy… I see. You’ve been watching
too much CNN. That crazy “Freddy” cult thing – it’s all over the TV day
and night – you can’t get away from it. No wonder you kids are all
having nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: But this one was different… it felt
real.</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: But that’s just it, Meagan… dreams
aren’t real. They’re just broken fragments of the subconscious mind.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Fear is real though, isn’t it? And if
nightmares are fear, then doesn’t that make them real?! And if the
nightmares are real then is reality like a dream?!</p>
<p><strong>school nurse</strong>: Meagan! You’ve got heat prostration…
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Old witch… what does she know? She isn’t
even qualified to give a shot and she’s telling me that my dreams aren’t
anything to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So she said you were okay?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, sure… Madame Curie in there says it’s
just a case of heat pro- stration and an overdose of TV news. Ruined my
makeup, too.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So you’re going back to class?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No. She gave me last period off.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, what are you bitching about? I could
have a compound fracture of the skull and she wouldn’t excuse me from
P.E.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse! I’ve been having nightmares for
almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse! Now I’m having
daymares! I want to know why!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay… well, didn’t the nurse say it was heat
probation?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: You don’t understand… I want to know more
about dreams. What they mean… why we have them.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay, Meg, go look it up. You’ve got the rest
of the day off, that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That’s a good idea. Why don’t you cut last
period and come with me?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Sure. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: The library.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You want me to cut school so we can go to the
library?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Find anything?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What? Oh, no… nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Did you know that our sub-conscious retains
everything that ever happened to us? Everything. From the time we’re
born until we die.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That’s how Freddy gets at us… by using our
sub-conscious fears. Fears our conscious minds have repressed or
forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I’ve got a news flash for you… Freddy’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I’m not so sure… if Freddy exists in our
sub-conscious then he can never be fully erased. Like a bad memory… you
may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in
your dreams. Weren’t you scared as a child by something so stupid that
you’re ashamed to admit it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Well, what? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Well… when I was kid, my brother took me to
the carnival. And in the penny arcade there was this robot
gunslinger…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Black Bart.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You know about Black Bart?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Duh. You put your quarter in and he says,
“Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot.” And then you pull your gun out and
shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: That’s just it – I never could! I’d point the
gun right at him and shoot, and I could never hit the guy. So I always
got killed.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No one can hit him – it’s a gyp.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Scared the shit out of me.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Isn’t that scary? I mean… for a kid?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay, smartass… what about you? What scared
you the most as a kid?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I remember… Lizzy wandered off one day and
we couldn’t find her. The police came and everything. I wasn’t really
worried until I saw her picture on TV… then I got really scared. Jesse,
I can’t explain it… but I think something bad’s going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You’re stupid!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: No, you are!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: They forgot you again!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: No, they didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes, they forgot and you’re goin’ to wait
out here until it’s dark and then the monsters are goin’ come and get
you!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: No they won’t, because I’m walkin’ home!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with me! I
got forgot too, you know!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Okay… I’m going to have to report this!</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Didn’t you get my message?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What message?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: I called the school after lunch… I had
to stay late after work…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Don’t you dare blame this on her, you
sorry bastard! It’s all your fault! Where have you been anyway?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: The library.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: A likely Goddamn story!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Dad… what’s wrong? What’s happened? Where’s
Lizzy?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: She didn’t come home from school
today. The police got a report that a girl fitting Lizzy’s description
was forced into a car by some crazies. They’re pretty sure it was this
“Freddy” cult.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Now don’t worry. The police are doing
everything they can.</p>
<p>****: Hey, Cap’n… better have a look up here!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Looks like she was in the cult all
along.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No… no, she wouldn’t do that! Lizzy wouldn’t
join Freddy’s cult!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: I know it’s hard to believe, miss. But a
lot of good kids get caught up in this kind of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Punks…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Captain Murdoch… is there any- thing
we can do?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
daughter before… well, before it’s too late. But rest assured, if I
can’t persuade her to come back to her loving home, then I’ll do what’s
best for her. I know you and your wife wouldn’t want her to suffer. Come
on… I want to go talk to Erwin.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Over to Stormie’s.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Stormie? I thought you and her weren’t
friends anymore since she stole that twenty dollars from you.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That was her “klepto” phase… when she was
dating that gang member. She dumped him a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I still don’t understand. What has she got to
do with Lizzy missing?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: She used to be in the Freddy cult. Maybe she
knows where they took Lizzy.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: If I did know I would call the police, you
know that. I love Lizzy. No telling what those freaks will do to her.
Those Freddy cult guys are hard core.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I thought you were in the cult?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I was in the cult for a week cause my
boyfriend at the time… Slasher, he was. But I just liked the music and
the clothes… when they were clean, but not like the violence and stuff.
But that was just my “cult” phase… but I got past that. You know, just
like my “gang” phase when I was dating Ramon and then before that was my
“death rock” phase when I was dating Stuart…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Uh, excuse me… but what phase are we in
now?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Militant feminist, man-hating phase, what’s
it fuckin’ to ya?!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Why don’t you just let the cops find her?
That guy Renton Murdoch – he knows how to deal with these cultist
psychos. He was the man who got Jason Voorhees.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That guy in my dreams…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Jason kicked his ass.</p>
<p>****: Well… yeah. But Murdoch put thirteen bullets in Jason before he
hacked his head open.</p>
<p>****: But even with his head hacked open and his brains leaking out,
Murdoch still managed to put his last bullet in Jason’s eye.</p>
<p>****: Well, one of my mom’s boyfriends worked at the hospital where
they took him. He said that Murdoch lost more than half his brain and
what little that was left was all twisted up inside. And they had to
replace his skull with a metal plate to keep that from leaking out.</p>
<p>****: They say he hasn’t been the same since.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: So what’s different about him?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: One thing… he used to be a Democrat. Now he
votes straight Republican.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I think he thinks Lizzy joined the cult or
something.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Oh, my God… he’ll kill her.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I’ve got to find Lizzy myself. I’ve got to
find her and save her from Freddy before that crazy cop kills her.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Just where are you going to look? I mean,
these cult guys could be holding her anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Murdoch said something about going to talk
to somebody named Erwin.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the Freddy
cult! I bet he knows where they took Lizzy!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Not Squirmin’ Erwin – that freak that used to
eat bugs?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Who else? Erwin is scary smart – always
brought home “A”s – but he was kinda fucked up, too… I mean, who isn’t
really? Anyway, he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him
away for his own safety. They say Freddy’s put a death hex on Erwin.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: A death hex?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Yes, a death hex. You know… where someone
wants you dead!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I want you to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Don’t be mad… it’s just that you might scare
him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Scare him?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: What she’s subtly trying to tell you is
that this needs a woman’s gentle touch… butthead.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Just stay here… okay?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Yo, Erwin… you’ve got a couple of
visitors. Now be a good boy… You’ve got five minutes. I’ll be right down
the hall if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Erwin…?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Where do you shoot?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Shoot?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: He’s talking about dream dope – the stuff
the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I don’t do drugs.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: You’re not in the cult?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Didn’t Freddy send you to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>meagan/stormie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I don’t trust you… better take off your
clothes so I can check you for tracks.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Chill, Erwin. We’re here for some hard data
– not a floppy disk.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Well, what do you want? Can’t you see I’m
busy?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Freddy’s cult kidnapped my sister.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I told her you might know where they took
her.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I already told the cops everything I
know.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Tell me… please.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Look… I’m sorry about your sister, but I’ve
got my own problems with Freddy. I’m a marked man, you know.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Then tell me why they took her…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: To bear his child. Freddy wants to be human
again. In order to do that he has to be “reborn”.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: How can he do that?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: He has to marry a virgin on holy ground. Then
the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: The whole cult? Yeech!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Freddy’s the son of a hundred maniacs. It’s
sort of a tradition with him.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: And Freddy enters the soul of the fetus
through a dream state. Voila! Rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: That’s the stupidest shit I ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Hey, they’re not my rules… some- body else
wrote ’em.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Erwin… you’ve got to help me find Lizzy.
You’re my only hope.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I’ll help you find your sister, but you’ve
got to help me.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Anything. Just name it.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: You have to help me kill Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: But Freddy’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Freddy lives… If only in our dreams.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Come on, Meagan… our five minutes is up.
He’s giving me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: How can you kill a dream?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: When it’s not a dream. Do we have a deal?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: No! I won’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Come on, Jesse! Please…?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: It’s illegal! I could go to jail!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: How will they ever know? Don’t be such a
pussy!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, yeah? Why don’t you call then?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Okay, I will!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No! They’ll never believe her!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I can disguise my voice… Hello, how do you
do? My name is Jesse. I think I’m a man but I’m actually a wimp.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: They’ll never believe that. Come on, Jesse…
for me?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay… okay… I’ll do it. And I’m not a
wimp!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: I need a quarter for the phone.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Springwood Mental Center… how can I
help you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: There’s a bomb planted in your building.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: If I were you – I’d get my ass out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Oh, yeah… Freddy Lives.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: Hey, Erwin… where do you think
you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I’m talking to you, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: He’s not going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: We’ve got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Hi, my name’s Erwin. Thanks for busting me
out of there!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Yeah, right… Look, Erwin, just do me one
favor – don’t eat nothing disgusting. My stomach is tight enough as it
is.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Damn! We must have just missed them!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, my God – she was here! This is part of
Lizzy’s shirt! It’s all torn! Erwin… we’ve got to find her!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We’re too late! There’s no way… except…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Except what?!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We could go after Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We’ll inject ourselves with Dream Dope. It’s
a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Okay… let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Meagan… we don’t do drugs! I mean, what if
one of us gets hooked or something? We could turn out like him!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Don’t worry about it. We need you wide awake
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We’re going to go under and try to find
Freddy. When we do, we’ll grab him and bring him here. Then you kill him
with this…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: This rusty chunk of shit? What good is
this?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: It’s not the gun, it’s what’s in it – silver
bullets blessed by a priest.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Will that work?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Should. But then…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: You don’t make the rules… yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Have a seat over there and make yourselves
comfortable. Roll up your sleeves and put these on…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Oh, cool!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What are they for?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: It’s how the cult keeps in constant contact
with Freddy. The little lights flashing are a sustained occular input
that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency
at which the dream state is most likely to occur.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Whatever… Put ’em on – they’re really
cool!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: It helps to hold hands if you want to go
together…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: And remember… Freddy knows what scares
you.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Meagan… help me… please…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Freddy’s trying to split us up…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Okay, Freddy… there’s a new sheriff in
Dreamland now.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Looking for some-body?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I’ve got him! Wake us up! Wake us up!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Don’t just stand there! Wake us up!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Hmmmmm… I feel like seafood tonight.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Stew on this, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Shoot him! Shoot him!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Well, well, well… if it isn’t my ol’ pal,
Erwin.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’ve got something special in mind for
you…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: You didn’t help me, you pussy! I could’ve
had him! You gutless… spinless… jelly fish!</p>
<p>****: Meagan… help me… Meagan…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Shuuuuu! I’m trying to be
invisible…</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Help me…</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Meagan…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: He got away… I had him and he got away. Oh,
God… Lizzy… I lost her…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Well, atleast you’re not dead.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No… I’m not dead… No… I’m not. But Freddy
killed me!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: He killed me, too. But look…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Now that I think about it – he’s killed me
in all my nightmares. But I’m not dead… what does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: It means we’ve still got some time left.
Until his remains are host to the Dream Demons – Freddy can’t hurt
us.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hello. The Dream Demons…?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Freddy made a pact with Satan when he died…
so Satan bestowed upon him the Dream Demons. They’re the source of
Freddy’s power to manipulate our physical reality. Without them… he’s
powerless – nothing more than a bad dream. Hey, like I said… I don’t
make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: But we’ve still got a chance, right? A
chance to kill Freddy before he gets back his power?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We already tried that. There’s no way for us
to kill Freddy. He’s too clever. He knows how to get to us.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Then let’s get somebody else. Some- body
strong.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Yeah! We could hire somebody to kill Freddy
– like a hit man!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: You would have to hire a thousand of them… or
one really big guy who isn’t afraid of anything. No fear. Nada. Then you
got a shot.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Where are you going to find a hit man? The
yellow pages? In your dreams…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason…</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Jason?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason Voorhees…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Jason Voorhees… that’s brilliant! The perfect
dream warrior… no fear.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Sounds like our man!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Uh… excuse me, Einstein… but isn’t Jason
Voorhees dead?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal Lake
somewhere. But don’t worry, I know how to bring him back to life.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Somehow I just knew you would.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: But that’s not the problem. The problem is
control. Once we bring Jason back from the dead… I’m not one hundred
percent sure he’ll do what we tell him.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Well, that’s okay… as long as he doesn’t
chop us all up.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Erwin… I’m trusting you on this, so tell me
the truth. Do you think if we do this – if we go and get Jason and bring
him back to life, that he could kill Freddy?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: No doubt about. Jason could wreck Freddy on
this side of the Dreamline. But if Freddy has home court advan- tage… I
don’t know. Too close to call. The trick would be to get Jason to enter
a dream state, grab Freddy, and drag him out to our reality.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I haven’t got a choice. I’ve got to try
something… I can’t ask either of you to help me do this… it’s illegal,
immoral, disgusting…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Hey, we sisters have to stand together,
right? Where you lead – I’ll follow. Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Let me get this straight… we’re going to go
dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: That’s about the size of it… and I’d be doing
you a disservice if I said there weren’t a modicum of risk involved.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Meagan… I don’t want to do this…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: You don’t have to, Jesse… it’s not your
fight. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: But I damn sure don’t want you to do it
without me. Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Look out Freddy… here we come.</p>
<p><strong>night watchman</strong>: What’s matter, girl… you hear
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>night watchman</strong>: What’s this? A funeral
procession?</p>
<p><strong>cultist</strong>: That’s exactly what it is.</p>
<p><strong>night watchman</strong>: Yeah? Whose?</p>
<p><strong>cultist</strong>: Yours.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Smokin’!</p>
<p>****: We’re almost there…</p>
<p>****: We should pull over and ask directions.</p>
<p>****: If it doesn’t offend the men… ooops, sorry! There aren’t
any.</p>
<p>****: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I don’t think they’re open.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: It says, open all night.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Hey! Can we get some service out here?!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I don’t think there’s anybody here…</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: What do you kids want?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: We’re looking for the old cemetery that’s
supposed to be around here… somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: What do you want to know for?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: We want to see it.</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Ain’t nothin’ to see, girly… ‘cept a
bunch of ol’ graves.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Look, mister… can you give us directions or
not?</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: You’re not goin’ up there to do
somethin’ stupid, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Stupid? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Like dig up Jason Voorhees – that’s
what!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Jesus… why would anyone do that?</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: I dunno… but people do.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Been dug up a few times already, has
he?</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: More times than I care to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Well, we’re just doing an article for our
high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at
night. You know, stuff that can get you hurt…</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Well… okay… as long as you’re not
going up there to do something stupid. Take this road up about a mile
and make a left at the ol’ saw mill. That road will take you right on
in… Eternal Peace Cemetery – can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What’s the story on Jason Voorhees
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Where have you been? Jason was that guy who
ran around in a hockey mask, chopping up camp counselors, duh?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I knew that. What I mean was why?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: It started a long time ago, back in the
fifties, when Jason drown at Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went berserk
and started killing the counselors.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: She got her head chopped off by one of the
girls she was trying to kill!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Right. And then Jason came back from his
watery grave to get revenge.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: He came back from the grave?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Yeah. Chopped up a number of people before
they finally caught up to him.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What happened to him then?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: They killed him.</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: How can you kill somebody who’s back from the
grave?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Not very well apparently. Jason keeps coming
back to life and chopping people up. It’s a never ending cycle of terror
up here at Crystal Lake – a real problem.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Why does he keep coming back to life and
killing people?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: They say he’s looking for revenge on the camp
counselor who murdered him as a child. Jason just happens to go about it
in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he
finds until he gets the right one. Here it is…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Look… the boogerman! Get it?!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Get back, you nasty-ass bastard! Ug! I
thought I had seen the last of those when my brother graduated third
grade!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: We just dug up a rotting corpse and you’re
worried about a little snot.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I’m exhausted… wake me when we get back
home.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Uhhh… better not fall asleep – we’ve still
got a lot of work to do and Freddy’s out there… waiting.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Well, that means we’ve all got to stay
awake!</p>
<p><strong>jesse</strong>: Duh?!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I know! We’ll sing a song! Row! Row! Row
your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily…
life is but a dream. Come on, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: …merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily… life is
but a dream.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Shouldn’t dream and drive.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Looks like the cat’s out of the bag now!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: It’s Freddy!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse’s hurt real bad… we’ve got to get him
to a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Don’t worry… an ambulance is on the way.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, God… Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Meagan… listen to me… The cops are on their
way. If they find me and Jason Voorhees in the trunk there, we’re
finished.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Go… get out of here. Take Jason and Stormie
with you.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I’m staying with you.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I’ll call you at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Somehow!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Is he going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes. But he needs a lot of rest. His leg is
broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Hey doc, is there someplace I could get us
something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m afraid the cafeteria is closed. There
are some vending machines in the lobby. I’ll be back to check on him in
a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I’ll be right back… I’m goin’ go score us
some munchies.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Okay, Sheriff… This nightmare ain’t big
enough for the two of us… draw!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Three’s a crowd, bitch! Why don’t you just
go get</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Go ahead… make my dream!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Freddy killed Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Jesus… get a grip, lady. You’d think a
nurse in a hospital would have seen a dead body before.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie please
pick up the white paging phone for a message?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: This is Stormie…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Did you see a couple of girls go by here a
moment ago?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Just missed ’em.</p>
<p><strong>hospital operator</strong>: The message is from Erwin… he
says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Where’d you get the truck?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Same place I’ve got Jason hid.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: And where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: A place where no one ever goes.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: What’d you do – take him for a swim?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Is she going to be alright?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I don’t know. She’s pretty fucked up. God,
I don’t know why I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: You’re a strong woman.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Uhhh… nothing. I didn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Is this him?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Yeah… Meet the new and improved Jason.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Why’d you put that stupid mask on him?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Take a look…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Not exactly a beauty queen entry, is he?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: So what do we do now – sing an Ozzy
Osbourne song backwards or something?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I’m afraid it’s not that simple…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I thought you said you knew how to bring
him back to life?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I do! But when I was putting him back
together, I noticed something was missing.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Awwww, he won’t be needing that… I mean,
what girl would let him put his rotten ol’…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: No-no! Not that! It’s his heart… it’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Well… does it really matter? Can’t you use
an aquarium pump or something?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: No… he has to have a heart. A human heart. A
good one.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I know where we can get a heart… A good
one.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: That guard in there might pose a problem.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Do you think you and Stormie could keep him
occupied for a few minutes?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Okay… let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Hey! Watch that!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I’m just trying to make it look real.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Just keep your hands above the bra, pizza
face.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Forgive me, Jesse…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: He’s head right for her! Do some-
thing!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Stop right there!</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: They said they were writin’ for some
newspaper…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Teenagers are notorious liars.</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Well, after I heard about the
accident on my police scanner, I came up here to have a look. When I
found it I figured you’d want to know right away.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Damn kids… I just knew they were
comin’ up here to do somethin’ stupid.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Just got a call on the radio –
three juveniles just broke into the morgue – one male, two female. The
guard is pretty sure the male is in the Freddy cult – burnt face.</p>
<p><strong>crazy ol’ coot</strong>: Sounds like the same kids I saw.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Did the guard say what they took?</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Yeah… that murdered kid, Jesse –
they carved his heart out. They got away in a pick-up – the guard didn’t
get the license. You want me to put out an A.P.B.?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: No… that won’t be necessary. I know just
where they’re going, and just what they’re up to. And this time… I’ll be
ready.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: You’ve got to quit blaming your- self for
what happened to Jesse… it wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: He didn’t want to come with us… but he did
anyway. He did it for me.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I’m not sorry I came… I don’t think Jesse
would be, either.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I just can’t believe he’s dead. I keep
thinking he’ll show up any minute…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Well, that just about does it…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: As you can see, I’ve excavated the power
cable that runs across the bottom of Crystal Lake. I’ve cut away the
insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Now when I kick this over, the water will
wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and
the lake. There’s plenty of voltage, so it should work.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: So you kick the bucket and Jason lives.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Yeah, right… Okay, keep your fingers
crossed…</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: Jason! Git your ass over here!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: What did I teach you, boy? Don’t
ever take your mask off out in public. I don’t want nobody to see that
ugly mug of yours.</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: Go git in the woodshed.</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: Drop them overalls and lay over them
logs…</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: Jason! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: What are you doing woman?</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: I saved up some money… I want you to
take and go on up to that summer camp just up the road. Tell the man you
want to stay there.</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: Just what the hell do you think
you’re doing, bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: I’m sending him away for a few
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: You ain’t sending him nowhere. Bring
me that money, boy!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: Go on now… go!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s father</strong>: Goin’ ag’in me? I’ll take you to the
shed, woman!</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: You ain’t ever taking anyone to the
shed ever again.</p>
<p><strong>jason’s mother</strong>: Go on, son… have a good time! Mommy
will come and git you some day soon!</p>
<p><strong>head counselor</strong>: Welcome aboard, son! I’m sure you’ll
have a great time!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Holy shit! It worked!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: It’s kill him! Shut it off! Shut it off!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Shut it off… it suddenly occurs to me that I
hadn’t really planned for that contingency.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Just don’t stand there! Do something!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason! JASON! You’ve got to get up! Do you
hear me? Get up!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Well… it’s off now.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Hey! Come back! I’ve got him locked up in the
tool shed!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Who are you calling?!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: The cops! Who else?!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Are you kidding?! They’ll lock us up and
throw away the key!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Fine by me! Damnit! It’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: He’s right behind me!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: You’re the one who brought him back to
life!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: And?!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Well, do something!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Oh, some hero!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Now… just stop! We’re the ones that brought
you back to life. And you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw!
In fact… you owe us…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: That’s right! She gave you her boyfriend’s
heart, you know!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Look! Here’s his picture…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Now, I know that you’ve been through a lot.
And I know that you’re pissed off about being murdered and all.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I know I would be!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: But if you help us kill Freddy Krueger… I
promise to help you find the little bastard that killed you. What do you
say? Have we got a deal?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: You in there! This is Captain Renton
Murdoch – State Trooper! I am ordering you to come out with your hands
up! I’ll give you until the count of three… Three!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason, you have to hide! Stay in here and
don’t come out until we tell you. Stormie… help me!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Alright… anybody else left in there had
better say their prayers!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: There’s no one else inside.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Is that a fact? Okay… you had your
chance!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, look!</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Holy Mary, mother of God… would
you look at the size of that guy?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Stand back! I’ll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: That’ll teach you to fuck with the law,
Voorhees!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Uhh, sir… your hat’s on fire.</p>
<p><strong>curious cop</strong>: Hey… do you see that?</p>
<p><strong>partner</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>curious cop</strong>: I thought I saw something…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: We’ve got to try and stay awake.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Getting something to eat might help. Yo,
Butch!</p>
<p><strong>deputy miller</strong>: It’s Deputy Miller.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could we have
something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>deputy miller</strong>: I thought you psychos only ate human
hearts?</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: And I thought you pigs only ate donuts.</p>
<p><strong>deputy miller</strong>: Don’t make me come back there.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
combo-burrito cud!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What am I going to do? I’ll never be able to
find Lizzy now.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: You should be worrying about your- self… I
know I am.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I bet you’re sorry you came with me now…</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Nah… what are best friends for? Afterall,
you stuck by me through all my crazy phases, I figure I owe you one big
crazy phase, right?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: That’s for being my best friend,
Stormie.</p>
<p><strong>deputy miller</strong>: Come on, Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>deputy miller</strong>: Your parents are here.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Oh, Meagan… are you alright? Let me
look at you…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I’m okay, mom.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Your mother’s been worried sick,
Meagan. So have I.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Sorry. Today has been a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Help! Help! Freddy’s here! He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: Oh, shit! I’m still asleep!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You know what they say… when you sleep – you
die!</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said you
helped one of those cultists escape from a hospital?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: A mental hospital.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: And he said you desecrated a cemetery
and some other really terrible things. Tell me you had nothing to do
with it. Tell me there’s some mistake…?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: There’s no mistake. What did you do with
Erwin?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Your boyfriend is headed back to the looney
bin where he belongs. But don’t worry, you’ll be seeing him soon enough…
at the arraignment.</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: You don’t scare me, Freddy! Thanks to my
various phases and many hours of watching violent televison, I have
become immune to violence. Seen it all and done it all! Nothing you do
can gross me out – so why don’t you give it your best shot, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Then maybe I’ll just CUT to the chase!</p>
<p><strong>stormie</strong>: I’m warning you, Freddy… my father is a
drill sergeant in the Marine Corps and he taught me just how to defend
myself against slimy bastards like you.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh I’m so scared, honey. Come on! Hit me!
Punch me right in the nose! I dare you!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Owwwww!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Now that’s what I call getting a buzz.</p>
<p><strong>boogerman</strong>: Hi there! I’m the Boogerman! Heh- heh…
get it?</p>
<p><strong>boogerman</strong>: Aww, don’t go… we can play “Star Wars”.
You can be Princess Leia and I’ll be Jabba the Hutt!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: We’re wasting time! We’ve got to close down
all the churches – Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy ground!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Don’t you understand?! He has to come to our
reality to do it! It’s our last chance to kill him!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Okay, I think we’ve heard enough of this
crap. Take her back to the lockup.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Dad! Mom! Don’t let them lock me up! I have
to save Lizzy!</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Oh, Meagan… you’re sick. You don’t
even realize what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I did what I had to do to try and save
Lizzy!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Yeah, including murdering your boy- friend
and cutting his heart out.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was already
dead when I cut his heart out!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Goddamnit, you don’t understand! Freddy
lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: I know how you must feel… I had a dog once.
I loved that dog. I treated her like my own daughter. We went camping,
picnics in the park… I even had a little stocking for her nailed up on
the mantle for Christmas. Then one day, she bit me… so I had to blow her
brains out. God, I loved that dog.</p>
<p><strong>boogerman</strong>: Uh-oh, Freddy’s picking his nose again –
gotta go!</p>
<p><strong>boogerman</strong>: Well, excuse me!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ahhh… ahhh… ahhh–CHOO!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Stormie?!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, God… what have I done? What have I
done?!</p>
<p><strong>ambulance driver</strong>: I’ll go check it out. You stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: You… want me to tell you where Meagan is?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Well why didn’t you say so?! Jesus, for a
minute there I thought you were going to kill me. You’re not, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Okay… okay! I’ll take you right to her. Could
you help me out of this?</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I’ll drive.</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Okay… you drive.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Fasten your safety belt, please.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Fasten your safety belt, please…
Fasten your safety belt, please…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Fuck the bitch. Let’s roll!</p>

<p><strong>gate guard</strong>: Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>cultist</strong>: No. I have a Beretta.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Something just happened at the TV
station.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Don’t worry about it – get undressed.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Time to get you cleaned up for court.</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: What’s the matter, honey… you don’t like
our company?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I like you… sure. It’s just that I usually
shower alone, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Oh! So you’re shy? I like ’em when
they’re shy…</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Don’t fight it, baby! You know you want
me…</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: If you won’t give me a piece then I’ll
just cut one for myself…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Wait a second… I didn’t mean to do that… I’m
sorry. It’s just that you come on a little strong, that’s all. Just give
me a little time to adjust to my new surroundings…</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Are you saying you want me now?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Yes… I want you.</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Now that’s more like it! Hey, this bitch
is alright!</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: You’re okay, honey… what’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: So… what’re you in for, Meagan?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, my friend…</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: The bitch that died last night?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Yeah… they said she had some disease that
made her… explode! Oh, God! Please hold me!</p>
<p><strong>bitch #1</strong>: What’s this bullshit about some killer
funk make you explode?</p>
<p><strong>head bitch</strong>: Easy… honey. It’s goin’ be alright. But
what I asked you is why you’re in here?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh… well… the cops? Well, they think I gave
it to her…</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: What the hell is all the screaming
about?!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Punks…</p>
<p><strong>junior trooper</strong>: Hey, that’s Captain Murdoch’s
car!</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: I won’t do it! It’s a sin!
Blasphemy!</p>
<p><strong>cultist</strong>: Wedding or funeral… your choice.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: And who would be the bride?</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: One… two… Freddy’s coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Three… four… Better lock your door.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: And the groom.</p>
<p><strong>cultist</strong>: He’s coming…</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: Five… six… grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: That’s for the lift sister! Hiya, kids!</p>
<p><strong>cultists</strong>: Hiya, Freddy!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Ready to get hitched?</p>
<p><strong>cultists</strong>: Ready, Freddy!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Then let’s do it!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I love you, Freddy…</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: We found your patrol car, Captain. It was
abandoned near a local religious station.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Religious station? Is there a padre
there?</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad- casts out
of that location.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: So that’s where they’re hiding.</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: …and if there be anyone among you
who has any reason why these two should not be joined in holy…</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: …in matrimony. Let them speak now…
…please God… …or forever hold their peace.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: You’re a virgin?!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Oh, that’s right – tell everybody!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier than
your retard sister… okay, you’ve got the job. Get her ready.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: This is Captain Renton Murdoch – State
Trooper. I’m giving you until the count of three to come out with your
hands up…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Hand me that flare pistol.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Good idea. Throw a little light
on them – see if we can spot their firing positions…</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Alright, now I’m through playing “nice guy”
– I want the rest of you punks to come out right now with your hands
up.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Well, it doesn’t look like
they’re going to surrender.</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: What we’re going to need then is somebody
to charge their lines – make a hole for us to slip in.</p>
<p><strong>s.w.a.t. commander</strong>: Where are you going to find
anyone that crazy?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Here comes one now…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: That was easy enough…</p>
<p><strong>reverend lovejoy</strong>: Once again… if there be anyone
among you who does not want these two people to be joined… let him speak
now or forever hold his peace.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Uh, oh…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: I can’t wake them up. Freddy’s got them
trapped!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Go get him, boy!</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen… welcome to the
fight of the century! I’m your ring announcer… Ted Bundy!</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: It wasn’t me!</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: In my left corner, weighing in at only
ninety seven pounds… the nightmare master himself! The one! The only…
Freddddddddy Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: And on my right… weighing in at a
whopping four hundred and thir- teen pounds… that killer of countless
teenagers… the big guy… Jason Voorhees!</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: And the prize tonight… not one but TWO –
count ’em – TWO virgins… ripe for the picking.</p>
<p><strong>ted bundy</strong>: Hey, have one now and save the other for
the ride home. That’s what I did.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Kick his ass, Jason!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, well… I just axed for that!</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Peasants…</p>
<p><strong>human head</strong>: That’s it, kiddo! You’re really giving
it to him out there! Use the left more – jab! Make him hurt! That’s the
ticket to a knockout!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason! Get up! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Jason! You’ve got to get up!</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Now’s my chance… give me sixty seconds to
get in there then move in.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: What took you so long?!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: What ever you do… don’t let this guy
drive.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I knew you would come…</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: Oh, no! Freddy’s in the transmitter!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: He’s going for the satellite dish! If he
uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any- where
in the world! We’ll never be rid of him!</p>
<p><strong>erwin</strong>: No! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Erwin? Erwin?!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: He’s dead… and so are you if you don’t put
your hands up right now!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: It’s time I taught you girls some respect
for the law!</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: So… you wanna be a punk?</p>
<p><strong>murdoch</strong>: Then die like a punk!</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: You forgot to check under the bed.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: No monsters here.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: But what if they come back?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Then we’ll just have to kick their ass
again.</p>
<p><strong>lizzy</strong>: I love you, Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I love you too. Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Meagan?</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Yes, dad?</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Your mom and I… well, we want to thank
you for saving your sister’s life… we know you went through a lot.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: We’re going to be there for you from
now on… for both of you! And that nice lawyer we hired for you said he
thinks he can get all the charges dropped… except maybe for the grave
robbing and human desecration ones.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Everything is going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: And I’m going to get sober…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: We’re going to be a normal, happy
family again.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s mom</strong>: Goodnight, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Goodnight mom… goodnight dad.</p>
<p><strong>meagan’s dad</strong>: Goodnight, Meagan.</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I’ll be seeing you in your dreams…</p>
<p><strong>meagan</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: I don’t think they’re coming back.</p>
