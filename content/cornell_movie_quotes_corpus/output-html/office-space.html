<p><strong>samir</strong>: Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass!! I just -</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: It’s late again. If I’m there late again, I
will be dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking.
Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hello, Peter. What’s happening? Uh� we have
sort of a problem here. Yeah. You apparently didn’t put one of the new
coversheets on your TPS reports.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah. I’m sorry about that. I, I
forgot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I’ve got the memo right
here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it’s not shipping out until
tomorrow, so there’s no problem.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure
you do that from now on, that will be great. And Uh, I’ll go ahead and
make sure you get another copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I’ve got the memo, I’ve got -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hello, Phil. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Milton? Uh, could you turn that down just a
little bit?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Uh, they said I could listen to the radio at
a reasonable volume from nine to eleven while I’m collating�.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But, no, no, no. I know you’re allowed to, I
was just thinking, like a personal favor, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I, I told Bill that if Sandra’s going to
listen to her headphones while she’ working, I can listen to the radio
while I’m collating -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: So I don’t see why -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: The radio, I can’t -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah! All right!</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I enjoy listening to the radio at a
reasonable volume from nine to eleven.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Hello, Peter. What’s happening? We need to talk
about your TPS reports.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh,
Bill talked to me about it.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Yeah. Uh, did you get that memo?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I got the memo. And I understand the
policy. The problem is, I just forgot this time. And I’ve already taken
care of it so it’s not a problem anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Yeah. It’s just that we’re putting new
coversheets on all the TPS reports before now before they go out now. So
I’d really appreciate it if you could just remember to do that. from now
on. That’d be great.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Peter Gibbons. Yes. I have the memo.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Oh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam
when there is no paper jam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I,
I, I just kick this piece of shit out the window!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: you and me both, man. The thing is lucky
I’m not armed.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Piece of shit!!</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Sam…ire…Na…Na…Naga…</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Uh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Michael� - Bolton?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Wow! Is that your real name?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: So are you related to the singer guy?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it’s just a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: How come no one in this country can pronounce
my name right? It’s Na- gee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: At least your name isn’t Michael
Bolton.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Michael, there’s nothing wrong with that
name.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: There was nothing wrong with it. Until I
was about nine years old and that no-talent assclown became famous and
started winning Grammys.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Well, why don’t just go by Mike, instead of
Michael?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s up G?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wanna go to Chotchkie’s, get some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: It’s a little early…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I gotta get out of here. I think I’m gonna
lose it.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Uh oh. Sounds like somebody’s got a case of
the Mondays.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Boy. I tell ya, one of these days… One of
these days it’s gonna be like</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Just coffee.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh. Sounds like a case of the Mondays.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What if we’re still doing this when we’re
50?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: It could be nice to have that kind of job
security.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lumbergh’s gonna have me work on Saturday, I,
I can tell already. I’m doing it because, because, uh, I’m a big pussy.
Which is why I work at Initech to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Uh, I work at Initech and I don’t consider
myself a pussy, ok?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yes, I am also not a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m gonna find out the hard way that I’m
not a pussy if they don’t start treating us software people better.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They don’t understand. I could come up with
a program that could rip that place off big time�big time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, there she is.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Peter, you, you always talk about this girl.
If you’re so obsessed with her, why don’t you just ask her out?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because I’m just another asshole customer.
You can’t just walk up to a waitress and ask her out. Plus, I’m still
trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. I’m not going to
be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh, I have to see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might
help. Y’know, sometimes I just think, I keep thinking that she’s
cheating on me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah. I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nothing. Why don’t you just tell Anne
you’re not into hypnosis and you want to play poker with us?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ah, I can’t do that. She might get all pissed
off at me. Besides, I think the guy might be able to help. He did help
Anne lose weight.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Peter, she’s anorexic.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I know. The guy’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: An occupational hypnotherapist isn’t going
to help you solve any of your problems. And speaking of problems, what’s
this I hear about you having problems with your TPS reports?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yeah. Didn’t you get that memo?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Is that Tom Smykowski?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, probably working on another heart
attack.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Have you guys see this?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What? It’s the staff meeting. So what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’re all screwed, that’s what. They’re gonna
downsize Initech.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They’re bringing in a consultant - that’s how I
know. That’s what this staff meeting is all about! That’s what happened
at Initrode last year. You have an interview with a consultant and they
bring in efficiency experts. You’re interviewing for your own job!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Tom, every week you say you’re losing your
job and you’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m going to be the first one they’re gonna lay
off. Just the thought of having to go to the State Unemployment Office
and having to stand in line with those scumbags!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shit. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know there are people in this world who
don’t have to put up with all this shit? Like that guy that invented the
pet rock. You see, that’s what you have to do. You have to use your mind
and come up with some really great idea like that and you never have to
work again!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t think the pet rock was really such
a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The guy made a million dollars! Y’know� I had
an idea like that once.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Really? What was it, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, all right. It was a Jump� to
Conclusions-mat. You see, it would be this mat that you would put on the
floor and it would have different conclusions written on it that you
could�jump to.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That is the worse idea I’ve ever heard in
my life, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yes, yes, it’s horrible�this idea�.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I’ll see
you guys later, if I still have a job.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Our high school guidance counselor used to
ask us what you would do if we had a million dollars and didn’t have to
work. And invariably, whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our
careers. If you wanted to build cars, then you’re supposed to be an auto
mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: So what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I never had an answer. I guess that’s why I’m
working at Initech.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, you’re working at Initech because that
question is bullshit to begin with. If that quiz worked, there would be
no janitors, because no one would clean shit up if they had a million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual
Funds and give the rest of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Samir, the point of the exercise is that
you could figure out what you want to do. And then� “PC load letter”?!!
What the fuck does that mean?!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lawrence, can’t you just pretend like we
can’t hear each other through the wall?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Oh! I’m sorry man, is Anne over there or
something?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No! But if you just want to talk to me, just
come over.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hey man. Check this out, dude.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh geez, Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I’m sorry, man. I thought you’d wanna see
this. Doesn’t this chick look like Anne?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hey, she hasn’t been over here in a while.
You two still going out?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I guess, yeah. I, I don’t know. Sometimes I
get the feeling that she’s cheating on me.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, I get that feeling too, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I don’t know , man, I just get that
feeling looking at her, like - I’m sorry, man. Look, I, I, I, I, I, I’m
talking out of my ass. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s ok. I just had a rough day.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Tell me about it, man. I gotta wake my ass
up at six AM every day of this week and drag myself up to Vascalinas.
Yeah, I’m doing the drywall up there at the new McDonalds.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me ask you something. When you come in on
Mondays, and you’re not feeling too well, does anybody ever come up to
you and say “sounds like someone’s got a case of the Mondays”?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you
get your ass kicked for sayin’ something like that, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: We still going fishing this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nah. Lumbergh’s gonna make me come in this
Saturday. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Well, you can get out of that easily.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, how?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Well, when you work on an Saturday, he
generally asks you at the end of the day, right? So all you have to do
is avoid him � That’s all right, i got one � The last few hours of the
day. And turn off your answering machine, you should be home free
then.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s a really good idea. Lawrence, what
would you do if you had a million dollars?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: I’ll tell you what I’ll do, man–Two chicks
at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s it? If you had a million dollars,
that’s what you’d do, two chicks at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Damn straight, man. I’ve always wanted to
do that. I figure if I were a millionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks
dig guys with money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well not all chicks�.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Well, the type that double up on a guy
like me do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Besides two chicks at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Nothing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day,
I would do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You don’t need a million dollars to do
nothing, man. Take a look at my cousin. He’s broke and don’t do
shit.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a
moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate
payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So you should ask yourself, with every
decision that you make Is this good for the company? Am I helping the
best way that I can for the company…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is that the guy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Good. Well, uh, I’d like to, uh, welcome a new
member to our team. Uh, Bob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant.
Yeah. He is a consultant. He’ll be helping us out a little here, asking
some questions, making sure things go a little more smoothly. Yeah. Oh
and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So, y’know, if you want
to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I, I don’t care if they, if they lay me off
either, because I, I told Bill that if he moves my desk one more time,
then, then I’m quitting. I’m going to quit. And I told Dom too because
they’ve moved my desk four times. I used to be by the window, where I
could see the squirrels and they were merry. But then they switched from
the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. They have
my staples for the Boston and I kept the staples from the Swingline
stapler.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok, Milton.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I
will set this building on fire.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, that’s great. I will talk to you
later.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, come on! Oh, for crying out -!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hello Peter. What’s happening? Um, I’m gonna
need you go ahead and come in tomorrow. So if you could be here around
nine, that would be great. Oh, oh, yea�I forgot. I’m gonna also need you
to come in Sunday too. We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to
sorta catch up. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So I’m sitting in my cubicle today and I
realized that ever since I started working, every single day of my life
has been worse than the day before it. So it means that every single day
you see me, that’s on the worse day of my life.</p>
<p><strong>dr. swanson</strong>: What about today? Is today the worse
day of your life?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr. swanson</strong>: Oh, that’s bad stuff.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dr. swanson</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But is there any way that you, you could just
sock me out so there’s no way that I’ll know I’m at work? Right here?
Can I just come home and think I’ve been fishing all day or
something?</p>
<p><strong>dr. swanson</strong>: That’s really not what I do, Peter.
However, the good news is, I think I can help you. I want you to do
something for me, Peter. I want you to try and relax. I want you to
relax every muscle in your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now
I want you to relax your legs. You’re going to begin to feel your
eyelids getting heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of
complete relaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing. Deeper,
way down, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now
when I count backwards from three, you’ll be in a state of complete
relaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you will
remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three. Deeper and deeper.
Way down, way down. Two. Way down. One.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh my God, Dr. Swanson! Ooh! Ooh! Is he dead?
Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yah, hi. It’s Bill Lundbergh. It’s about ten
o’ clock, uh, wondering where you are.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, hi, it’s Bill Lum -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, it’s -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, hi, it’s Bill Lumbergh -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, it’s me again. Uh, I was away from my
desk for a minute. Just checking in case you called while I was
gone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Peter, what’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s 3:30. Why aren’t you at work?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Because I didn’t feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Peter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit
there while Dr. Swanson dies and you just walk out of the car and
embarrass me in front of my friends. Don’t blame this on hypnosis
either. That’s total bull!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: From now on, you use the time sheets if you
work on two or more job codes and you need the extra columns to fit it
all in. Otherwise, use the old time sheets…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where’s Peter? How come he didn’t show up this
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …it would really, really help us out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So, uh, any questions?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi, I’m Peter.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hi. How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you doing for lunch today?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Well, our specials are barbecued chicken -
it’s actually right over there on the board. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey! Look who’s back! Table for three, to
-</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was asking what you were doing for lunch.
Would you like to have lunch with me?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I don’t , I don’t
think I’m supposed to do that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do. I’m
gonna go next door and get a table and if you’d like to join me, no big
deal. All right? And if not, that’s cool too. Ok?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Uh, when you say “next door”, do you mean
Chili’s or Flingers?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Flingers.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: So what you do is you take the
specifications from the customers and you bring them down to the
software engineers?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Well, then I gotta ask, then why can’t
the customers just take the specifications directly to the software
people, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are
not good at dealing with customers.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: You physically take the specs from the
customer?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or
the fax.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Then you must physically bring them to
the software people.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well…no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Well, what would you say� you do
here?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the
goddamn customers so the engineers don’t have to!! I have people
skills!! I am good at dealing with people!!! Can’t you understand
that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Let’s see. You’re Michael…Bolton?</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Is that your real name?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Are you in any relation to the pop
singer?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s just a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: I mean you must really love his
music.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah. Yeah�he, he, he’s pretty, he’s pretty
good, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: You’re GOD DAMN right he is.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: So tell me. What’s your favorite song of
his?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hmm. I, I, I don’t know. I mean, I guess, I
sorta like ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: HA HA! I feel the exact same way, but
it must be hard for you, I mean, having the same name as him. I
celebrate the guy’s entire catalogue. But anyway, let’s get down to
business, Michael!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You, you know, you can just call me
Mike.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I wonder if they will let me wear this in
here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think it would be ok. Would you like to sit
down?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. Wow. This place is really nice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, is it?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh my God, compared to Chotchkie’s. I like
the uniforms better anyways.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I like yours.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: “We’re not in Kansas anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah. Really.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s on your -</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh! That’s, uh, that’s uh, my pieces of
flair.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are pieces of flair?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: That’s where you know, suspenders and
buttons and all sorts of stuff. We’re, uh, we’re actually required to
wear fifteen pieces of flair. quite stupid actually.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you get to pick them out yourself?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn’t actually
choose these. I, uh, I just grabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don’t
even know what they say! Y’know, I don’t really care. I don’t really
like talking about my flair.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: So, where do you work, uh, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Initech.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: And, uh, what do you do there, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You see, they wrote all this bank software
and to save space, they put 98 instead of 1998. So I go through these
thousands of lines of code and uh, it doesn’t really matter. I, uh, I
don’t like my job. I don’t think I’m gonna go anymore.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: You’re just not gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Won’t you get fired?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. But I really don’t like it so
I’m not gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, no, not really. I’m just gonna stop
going.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: When did you decide all that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: About a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. So, so you’re gonna get another job?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think I ’d like another job.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Y’know, I never really liked paying bill? I
don’t think I’ll do that either.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I want to take you out for dinner and then I
wanna go to my apartment and watch Kung Fu. Did you ever watch Kung
Fu?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I love Kung Fu…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Channel 39.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Totally…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You should come over and watch Kung Fu
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. Can we order lunch first?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …stapler off my desk…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …anyway, sounds great, Bob. I’ll see you in a
few. Hey, Milton, what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Uh…sir…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, I’m going to have to ask you to move your
desk. Now, if you could get it to go as far back against that wall as
possible, that would be great.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No, no, because I was, I was -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That way, we’ll have some room for more boxes
and things we need to put in here.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No…sir…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh Oh there it is.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Let me just get that from ya. Great. So if you
could get to that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a
nice lunch, Milton. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Ok. I’ll set the building on fire.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What the hell’s going on, man? I thought
you were going to come in here and start shooting.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I just came to get my address book. I’m not
gonna stay. I’ve got a number I don’t wanna lose.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?! Peter, you’re in deep shit! You were
supposed to come in on Saturday. What were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely
nothing and it was everything that I thought it could be.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, I hope you have a better story than
that for Lumbergh. You know, you’re supposed to be having your interview
right now with the consultants.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What has gotten into you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man.
Tell them you were sick. Make something up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ah, no way. I feel great.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: The next paper looks like a Peter
Gibbons.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Aha! All right. We were just talking
about you. You must be Peter Gibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I’m Bob Slydell
and this is my associate, Bob Porter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi, Bob. Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Why don’t you grab a seat and join us
for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Y’see, what we’re trying to do here,
we’re just trying to get a feel for how people spend their day. So, if
you would, would you just walk us through a typical day for you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I generally come in at least fifteen
minutes late. I use the side door, that way Lumbergh can’t see me. Uh,
and after that, I just sorta space out for about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Space out?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks
like I’m working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch too.
I’d probably, say, in a given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes
of real, actual work.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport
and indulge us and tell us a little more?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me tell you something about TPS
reports…’</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The thing is, Bob, it’s not that I’m lazy.
It’s just that I just don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Don’t, don’t care?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s a problem of motivation, all right? Now,
if I work my ass off and Initech ships a few extra units, I don’t see
another dime. So where’s the motivation? And here’s another thing, Bob.
I have eight different bosses right now!</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eight bosses.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Eight?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eight, bob. So that means when I make a
mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it.
That’s my real motivation - is not to be hassled. That and the fear of
losing my job, but y’know, Bob, it will only make someone work hard
enough not to get fired.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Bear with me for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Believe me, this is hypocritical. But
what if you were offered some kind of stock option and equity sharing
program?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t know. I guess. Listen, I’m gonna go.
It’s been really nice talking to be of you guys.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Absolutely. It’s all on this side of
the table, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Good luck with your layoffs. I hope your
firings go really well.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, Peter, what’s happening? Listen, uh -</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Joanna? Would you come here for a moment,
please?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I’m sorry. I was late. I was having
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: I need to talk about your flair.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh,</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Now, it’s up to you whether or not you want to
just do the bare minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces
of flair. And a terrific smile.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Look. Joanna.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok?
They come to Chotchkie’s for the atmosphere and the attitude. That’s
what the flair’s about. It’s about fun.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. So, more then?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If
you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to
wear more and we encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Great. Great. That’s all I ask.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Right. So there’s three more people we
can easily lose. There’s Tom Smykowski.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’s useless.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Here’s a peculiar one. Milton
Waddams.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: We can’t find a record of him being a
current employee here.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: I looked into it more deeply and I found
what happened was he got layed off about five years ago and no one ever
told him about it. But through a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a
paycheck. I went ahead and fixed the glitch.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: So, um, Milton has been let go.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Just a second there, Professor. We, uh,
we fixed the glitch. So he won’t be receiving a paycheck anymore. So
it’ll just work itself out naturally.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: We always like to avoid confrontation
whenever possible. The problem is solved from here on, then.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Uh, we should move on to a Peter
Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this young man and boy does he have
Straight to Upper Management written all over him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Ooh, uh, yeah. I’m going to have to go ahead
and sort of disagree with you there. Yeah. Uh, he’s been real flaky
lately and I’m not sure that he’s the caliber person you want for upper
management. He’s been having some problems with his TPS reports.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: I’ll handle this. We feel that the
problem isn’t with Peter.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Um-um.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: It’s that you haven’t challenged him
enough to get him really motivated.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah, I’m not sure about that now.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: All right, Bill. Let me ask you this.
How much time each week would you say you deal with these TPS
reports?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine!
It’s a breast exam! Whoo!!</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Hello, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey Dom!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So, Peter, what’s happening? Now are you going
to go ahead and have those TPS reports for us this afternoon? Uh, yeah.
So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not right now, Lumbergh. I’m, I’m kinda busy.
In fact, I’m going to have to ask you to go ahead and just come back
another time. I have a meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, I wasn’t aware of a meeting with them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, they called me at home.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we’ll go
ahead and, uh, get this all fixed up for you later.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hi, Milton. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I, I, I, I, I didn’t receive my paycheck
this week.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, you’re gonna have to talk to Payroll about
that.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I, I did and they, and they said -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, we’re gonna need to move your desk
downstairs into Storage B.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No…I…I…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Uh, we have some new people coming in and we
need all the space we can get.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No…no…no…no…but…but…but…I, I, I -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And if you could could go ahead and get a can
of psticide and take care of the roach problem we’ve been having that
would be great. away.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I can’t…Excuse me. I believe you have my
stapler?</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: It looks like you’ve been missing a lot
of work lately.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I wouldn’t say I’ve been missing it, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: That’s terrific, Peter. I,I, I’m sure
you’ve, you’ve, you’ve heard some of the rumors around the hallway about
how we’re just going to do a little housecleaning with some of the
software people.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do
what you gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Well, these people here. First,
Mr. Samir Naga…Naga…</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Naga…</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: Naga-worker here anyway!</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Mr. Mike Bolton. We’re certainly gonna
miss him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: We’re gonna bring in some entry level
graduates for us to work in Singapore, that’s the usual deal.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Well, it’s standard operating
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do they know about this yet?</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: No! No, of course not. We always find
it’s better to fire people on a Friday. It’s statistically shown that
there’s less chance of an incident if we do it at the end of the week.
Anyway, Peter, what we would like to do is put you into a position where
you would have as many as four people working right underneath you.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: This is a big promotion, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Huge.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So you’re gonna fire Samir and Michael and
give me more money?</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Umm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. That’s it. That’s exactly what
I need. Just give it to me. Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let’s
go! That’s what I need. Let’s do that. Let’s do exactly that, you
little, fu-</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen… Well, what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There comes a place in a man’s life and, uh,
maybe that time for you is now, when it doesn’t hurt to think about the
future.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think
about yourself, sport. You’re the one who’s been flaking out at work.
Whatever that religious experience or whatever the hell it was, you
better snap out of it, or you’re gonna get canned.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I, I, I…Listen, that virus you’re
always talking about. The one that, that could rip off the company for a
bunch of money…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah? What about it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, how does it work?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s pretty brilliant. What it does is
where there’s a bank transaction, and the interests are computed in the
thousands a day in fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off.
What this does is it takes those remainders and puts it into your
account.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah. They did this in Superman III.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. What a good movie.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and
one of them got busted.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, so they check for this now?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, you see, Initech’s so backed up with
all the software we’re updating for the year 2000, they’d never
notice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re right. And even if they wanted to,
they could never check all that code.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s numbers up their asses.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So, Michael, what’s to keep you from doing
this?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s not worth the risk. I got a good
job.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What if you didn’t have a good job?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Cockos! Samir and I are the best
programmers in that place. And you, you haven’t even been showing up and
you get to keep your job.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Actually, I’m being promoted.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What?!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I know, Michael. It’s completely
unfair. And I realized something today. It’s not about me and my dream
of doing nothing. It’s about all of us together. I don’t know what
happened at that hypnotherapist the other day; maybe it was just shock.
It’s wearing off now, but when I saw that fat man keel over and die,
Michael, I realized that we don’t have a lot of time on this earth. We
weren’t meant to spend it this way. Human beings weren’t meant to sit in
little cubicles, starring at computer screens all day, filling out
useless forms and listening to eight different bosses drone on about
mission statements.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I told those fudge-packers that I like
Michael Bolton’s music. God.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: that is not right, Michael. For five years
now, you’ve worked your ass off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or
some kind of profit sharing or something. Five years of your mid-20s
now, gone. And you’re gonna go in tomorrow and they’re gonna throw you
out into the street. You know why? So Bill Lumbergh’s stock will go up a
quarter of a point. Michael, let’s make that stock go down. Let’s take
enough money from that place that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle
ever again. Your software works right?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Of course it works. That’s not the point.
Look, even if it could work, I don’t know how to install it. I don’t
know the credit union software loan.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah? But Samir does.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: But that’s not much money, I -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a
fraction of a cent. That’s too small to notice. Take a thousand
withdrawals a day, space it out over a few years, that’s a couple
hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just like Superman III.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Superman III - that’s it, I have to leave
now, ok? I have to get my resume ready.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get your resume ready for what? Another job
where they can fire you for no reason?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: That’s right! If I’m lucky.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I’m
tired of being pushed around. Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yes, Peter, but I’m not going to do something
illegal.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit
down! Come on! This isn’t Riyadh! They’re not gonna saw your hands off,
all right? The worse they can do is put you for a couple of months into
a while collar, minimum security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky!
Did you know they have conjugal visits there?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Shit, I’m afraid. I haven’t had a conjugal
visit in six months.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This thing actually is pretty fail-safe,
Samir.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You came here looking for a land of
opportunity. And this is the knock of that opportunity. Tomorrow’s your
last day at Initech. You have two options</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: I have a question.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: In, in these conjugal visits, you can have
sex with women?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yep. You sure can.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Ok. I’m gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s what I’m talking about! I’m talking
about America!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Peter Let’s discuss the plan, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: All right. It works like a computer virus.
All right? So all we have to do is load it anywhere into the credit
union mainframe and it’ll do the rest.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok, you guys give me that disk and I’ll take
it from there. Oh, but listen. Before we go any further, all right, we
have to swear to God, Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No
family members, no girlfriends, nobody!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Don’t worry man! I won’t tell anybody
about this either!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Who the fuck is that?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh, don’t worry about him. He’s cool. All
right. Now here’s how I see it all going down…</p>
<p><strong>bob slydell</strong>: Peter, congratulations. This is one
heck of a promotion.</p>
<p><strong>bob porter</strong>: And we’ll go ahead and get some people
under you right away.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, that was easy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I guess it was.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What did you do with the -</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hey guys.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, hey Drew.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: did you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The guy who got laid off?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: No, man, check this out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. smykowski</strong>: Are you ok, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m ok.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. smykowski</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It seems to be working now. See ya later,
honey. Love ya.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, is he ok?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Sort of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a
couple of ribs, his back. But check it out. He’s gonna get a huge
settlement out of this. Like seven figures. He’s getting out of the
hospital this weekend and he’s throwing a big party to celebrate. I’m
thinking I’m gonna take that new chick from Logistics. I might be
showing her my O face. Oh! Oh! Oh! you know what I’m talking about. Oh!
Yeah. Right. See you guys there.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wow, our last day at Initech.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: I can’t believe they had security escort us
out. Not like we’re gonna steal something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I stole something.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh yeah. I guess we all did.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, I stole something else.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: What did you steal?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll call it a going away present.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Everything is going to be ok. Ok?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: The one I see is -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta
go. Joanna’s coming over. Don’t worry! You’re worrying! All right?
Monday morning we’re gonna check the account balance and everything will
be all right. Don’t miss Tom’s barbecue. I’ll see you there.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hey, what were you guys celebrating last
night?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Um, I’m not really at liberty to talk about
it. I really can’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So when the subroutine compounds the
interest, right, it uses all these extra decimals places that just get
rounded off. So we just simplify the whole thing and we just round it
down and drop the remainder into an account that we own.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: So you’re stealing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ah, no. No. You don’t understand. It’s, uh,
very complicated. It’s, uh, it’s, it’s aggregate so I’m talking about
fractions of a cent that, uh, over time, they add up to a lot.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. So you’re gonna make a lot of money,
right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. That’s not yours?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, it, it becomes ours.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: How’s that not stealing?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think, I don’t think I’m explaining
this very well. Um, this Seven Eleven, right? If you take a penny from
the tray -</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: From the crippled children?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, that’s the tray. I’m talking about the
tray. The penny’s for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh, for everybody. Ok.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, well, those are whole pennies.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Right. I’m just talking about fractions of a
penny here, but we do it from a much bigger tray. A couple of million
times. So what’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: It seems wrong.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is
an evil corporation, all right? Chotchkie’s is wrong. Doesn’t it bother
you that you have to get up in the morning and put on pieces of
flair?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah, but I’m not about to go in and start
taking money from the register!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but
they made the Jews wear them.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, we don’t - I, I - we don’t have to talk
about this. Let’s just go to the barbecue, all right?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Michael! Samir! How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hiya Tom.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Hi Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, I’d like you to meet my lawyer, Rob
Newhouse. Rob, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hello Michael.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Samir.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hello -</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Samir.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: …Samir.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Peter!! How are ya? I’m glad you could make
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Tom! Hi! This is someone I’d like you to
meet. This is Joanna.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hi. Forgive me for not getting up. Ooh…Ooh… Uh,
Peter, Peter, come here a minute. I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, what do you think? It’s a prototype.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, that’s exactly as you described it. Uh,
listen, I, I heard about your settlement. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, thanks, Peter. y’know, I’m glad you’re
here because I wanted to talk to you. I know how you get depressed about
your job and all, and I just wanted you to know that’s how you feel. I
used to be the same way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure. Oh maybe I didn’t whine as much, but I
hated my job as much as you and I’ve been doing good for over thirty
years!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just remember</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aw, sure.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Conjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a
minimum security prison is no picnic. I have a client in there right
now. You see, the trick is, kick someone’s ass the first day or become
someone’s bitch. Then everything will be all right. Why do you ask,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh, no, we were just seeing -</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hey Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Drew.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: That’s something about old Tom Smykowski,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Lucky bastard. Hey, isn’t that the girl who
works over at Chotchkie’s?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Hmm, who’s she here with?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s here with me.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: All right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make
sure you wear a rubber, dude.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why’s that, Drew?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Are you kidding me? She gets around, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She does, does she?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Oh yeah. Like a record.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Well, let’s see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let
me see who else…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lumbergh?!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I
just don’t know if this is such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: What?! What are you - Oh! All right,
Lumbergh…</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Peter! What is wrong with you? That was like
to years ago! What, do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, I know him!! I know him! He’s my boss!!
He’s my unholy, disgusting, pig of a boss!!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh, he’s not that disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He represents all that is solace and wrong!
And you slept with him!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: That is none of your business, ok? I didn’t
ask you who you slept with before we were together. I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I didn’t think you would sleep with a
guy like Lumbergh!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Listen to you! Who do you think you are? How
dare you judge! Do you think you’re an angel or something? No! You’re
this petty, stealing, wannabe criminal…man!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I may be. But at least I never slept
with Lumbergh!!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Ok. That’s it. I’m done. I want to get out
of the car. Stop. I wanna get -</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Why don’t you call me when you grow up? Oh,
wait, that’s probably never gonna happen so just don’t call me, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Say hello to Lumbergh for me!!!</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: Lumbergh fucked her…Lumbergh fucked
her…Lumbergh fucked her…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh that’s great�great�</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong>: I’m gonna see the O-face again. Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ooh! Ooh!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why don’t you move it a little to the left?
That’s right. Great. Oh, hello, Peter. What’s happening? Uh, could you
give me those TPS reports ASAP? Mmmkay?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Joanna?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: We need to talk. Do you know what this is
about?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: My, uh, flair.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Yeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I’m counting
and I only see fifteen pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Umm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: What do you think of a person who only does
the bare minimum?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I
think, Stan. If you want me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like
your pretty boy Brian over there, then why don’t you just make the
minimum thirty-seven pieces of flair?</p>
<p><strong>stan</strong>: Well, I thought I remember you saying you
wanted to express yourself.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Y’know what? I do. I do want to
express myself. Ok? And I don’t need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do
it. All right? There’s my flair! And this is me expressing myself. There
it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn job and I don’t need
it!!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Shit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit!
This is a - fuck! Son of a bitch! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You tell me, Michael, it’s your software!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yes, it’s your software!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to
notice 305, 3 26.13!! Michael!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh shit! They, they probably won’t notice
it’s gone for another two or three days.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Michael! Michael! You said the thing was
gonna take two years!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You said the thing was supposed to work.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Well, technically it did work.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No it didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: It did not work, Michael, ok?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ok! Ok!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Ok?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ok! Ok! I must have, I must have put a
decimal point in the wrong place or something. Shit. I always do that. I
always mess up some mundane detail.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh! What is this fairly mundane detail,
Michael?!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ok quit getting pissed at me, all right?
This was all your idea, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: All right. Ok. All right. Let’s try not to
get pissed off at each other, all right? We’ll figure this thing out
together, ok? And the first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that
account down before it gets any bigger.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Mmm. You look terrific.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: All right, Kate, you wanna get everybody
started there. Mmm. That is terrific. That is just terrific. I really,
really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Milton, don’t be greedy. Let’s pass it along
and make sure everyone gets a piece.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Can I keep a piece? Because last time I was
told that -</p>
<p><strong>nina</strong>: Just pass.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: But this, this, it, it, it’s a little
cake…</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Is, is there a way to just give the money
back?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What? We just hand them a check with the
exact amount they’re missing? I, I think they’d figure that out.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Well, we have to do something.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: May-maybe we launder the money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s a great idea. Ok, how do we do
that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t know. I don’t even
know what it means. It’s something I think, I think coke dealers do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok. Do we know any coke dealers?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My, my cousin’s a cokehead. We’re in deep
shit.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yes. We are in very, very deep shit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Milton?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I wanted to see you because -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Say, you know what would be a great idea?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: No…no.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Since you’re already down here, it would be
great if you could get a ca of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach
problem we’ve been having in here.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: I…I…that’s really not my job and I haven’t
received my -</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: For now, why don’t you get a flashlight and a
can of pesticide and -</p>
<p><strong>dom</strong>: Bill! We need you upstairs right away. Some
major glitch in the accounting. A lot of money missing.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that’s the last
straw.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: It doesn’t really help us, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok. We’re looking up money laundering in a
dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, well, you guys can both eat my ass,
ok?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My girlfriend slept with Lumbergh, that’s
what I can’t believe.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Yeah, you didn’t know that?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It happened two years before you moved to
Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean, Ron Lumbergh, the airshow guy?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah, who did you think she slept with,
Bill? If she fucked him, their children would have hooves!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ron’s not related to Bill, is he?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t panic. It’s probably just the
mailman.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That is why I am selling magazine
subscriptions.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No -</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I was hoping you would help me out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You used to be
addicted to crack?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yes, but not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look, I’m sorry. I do not know anything about
money laundering.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Look, we’re not asking you if you know
about money laundering, we’re just trying to see if you can hook us
up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He doesn’t know anything, all right?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You
just give us the name of one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have
good networking skills.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re a software engineer?!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Working must be, must be very hard for
you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I made more money selling magazine
subscriptions than I ever did working at Initrode.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Huh? You worked at Initrode?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You can’t tell anybody about any of this
stuff I told you. I mean, we know a lot of the same people.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Actually, that all depends.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What am I going to do with forty
subscriptions to Vibe ?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I wish we had never done this. What are we
going to do? You know what I can’t figure out? How is it that all these
stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia guys can be so good at crime and smart guys
like us can suck so badly at it?</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: We’re new to it, though. If we had more
experience -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. No. Y’know what I think? I think we’re
screwed. There’s evidence all over that building to link it to us. Even
if we could launder money, I wouldn’t want to. If we’re caught while
laundering money, we’re not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison.
No, no, no. We’re gonna go to
federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: I don’t want to go to any prison! Why the
hell did I do this?! I’ve never done anything wrong in my whole life! We
weren’t thinking clearly because you told us we were losing our jobs!
And look at us now, we’re, we’re worried about going to prison!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I’ll think of
something.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Ass. I’m going home. You are a very bad
person, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lawrence! You awake?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, man!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You wanna come over?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No thanks, man. I don’t want you fucking
up my life too!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And now the sentence for these heinous crimes
committed against Initech. I hereby sentence you, Michael Bolton and
Samir Na…Ananajibad…to a term of no less than four years in federal-
pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. Peter Gibbons, you’ve lead a trite and
meaningless life. And you’re a very bad person.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey. You’re not working at Chotchkie’s
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: No, no, I got fired.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I flipped off my boss. And some customers -
actually a line just happened to be standing there, so…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going to go away for awhile. Uh, to jail.
Yea, about that computer scam, you were right�it was a bad idea. I’m
going to take the blame for it, I decided. I’m going to return the money
and leave the confession under Lumbergh’s door. Joanna, I wanna
apologize. I had no right to get pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn’t my
problem. It wasn’t even the right Lumbergh. I don’t know why I can’t
just go to work and be happy, like I’m supposed to like everybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Peter, most people don’t like their jobs.
But you go out there and find something that makes you happy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I may never be happy with my job. But
if I could be with you, I think that I could be happy with my life. But
if you could give it another shot, I promise, Joanna -</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: Oh shut up.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, what’s going on here? Get a room you
two!</p>
<p><strong>joanna</strong>: I hate that guy.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: …to Mr. Lumbergh and he told me to talk to
Payroll and then Payroll, they told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh. And I
still haven’t gotten my paycheck and they stole my stapler and they told
me to move my desk to Storage Room B and there was garbage all over it
and I don’t appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Um, why don’t you go and sit at your
desk. Mr. Lumbergh should be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Mr. Lumbergh -</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Just go and sit at your desk.</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: But -</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Ok, I, I, I’m going to set the building on
fire. I tell him, if I don’t get my stapler I’m going to have to get my
stapler back because it is my stapler. It’s my stapler, the Swingline.
It’s been mine for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, Lawrence, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Hey, Peter, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey. So, I may be going away for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Yeah, I know, man. It’s a bummer, dude,
what can I say?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Well, it’s time to go face the music.
You take care of yourself, cause I don’t wanna see ya.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You too, man. Take care. Hey Peter! Watch
out for the corn hole ok?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok, Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Let me see this.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Who would want that stapler, man? That’s
toasted, man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know someone who might want this.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey man! Wanna go out to lunch?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I brought mine in a pail. Plus, Joanna’s
supposed to come by later.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: So, how do you like your new job?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s not too bad. Not too bad. How’s
Penetrode?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Initrode.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Initrode.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: It’s work.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I could probably get you a job if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, thanks. I’m doing good here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So, uh, we’re gonna be ok, right?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. I think the fire pretty much took care
of everything.</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: But what if the money burned up? It’s too be
a scheme.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want us to get you a
job?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s the one thing I’m definitely sure
of.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: All right, G.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You guys take care!</p>
<p><strong>samir</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Stay in touch, man!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ok, will do. This isn’t so bad, huh? Making
bucks, getting exercise, working outside.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fuckin’ A…</p>
<p><strong>milton</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me, Senor. May I speak to
you please? I asked for a mai tai, a margarita, and a pina colada. I
asked for no salt, no salt in the margarita. But it had salt in it. If
you do that again, I won’t be leaving a tip. I won’t be putting one
down. Sir? I could check into a competing resort…</p>
