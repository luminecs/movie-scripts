<p><strong>1 ext. manhattan skyline - night 1</strong>: MOVING IN FAST
MOTION – a kaleidoscopic jewel box – glittering, shining and speeding
PAST our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>2 angle 2</strong>: MOVING south TO north FROM the Battery
and the World Trade Center, streets and buildings FLIPPING PAST like
black diamonds spilling INTO our peripheral vision and DISAPPEARING as
we SPEED uptown TOWARD…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. We’re getting closer. Can you feel it.
Can you see it? The heat. The brilliance. Moving fast into the heart of
it. Buzz. Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The
city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered
prayers.</p>
<p><strong>4 omitted 4</strong>: thru thru 11 11</p>
<p><strong>female aide</strong>: jumps onto the cart and tries to hold
him up. The male aide runs alongside the cart.</p>
<p><strong>various waiters</strong>: in black tie carry covered silver
trays as they trot through the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>male aide</strong>: pulls Fallow off the cart and continues
to lead him through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards run to
meet them. The guards and the aide now escort Fallow through the
area.</p>
<p><strong>elevator doors</strong>: open. Fallow is led out of the
elevator. Several other aides approach him and pull off his soiled
jacket and shirt and change them for fresh ones as they move.</p>
<p><strong>fallow</strong>: is led through the corridor and into…</p>
<p><strong>wall of flashing cameras</strong>: obliterate the view.
Fallow staggers, clutching his head and we…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: … And it begins on a rainy night, only a few
months ago.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Come on, Marshall. Come here. Stay. Come
on. Stay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about to make a
simple phone call. And despite the existence of eleven telephones and
seven different lines in the fourteen rooms of his six million dollar
plus apartment, this was a phone call he could not make at home.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What on earth are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I am taking the dog for a walk.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You are not taking the dog for a walk. You are
taking ‘Marshall’ for a walk. Marshall has a name. He is one of our
family. And, anyway, it’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So does Marshall. I don’t think he wants to
go. Do you, Marshall?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Have a nice time.</p>
<p><strong>14 omitted 14</strong>: &amp; &amp; 15 15</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: He don’t look too happy about it,
Mr. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Neither am I, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Tony, sir. My name is Tony.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes, of course. Come on, Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Hello, Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Good evening, Pollard.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: You know it’s raining, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. As a matter of fact, I did notice.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Ah, Sherman. A true friend to man’s best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Pollard, you old phrase-maker.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I mean, is that the best you can do? Is
that as witty as we get?</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about. And
furthermore, if you plan on being wet when you return, I suggest you
take the service elevator.</p>
<p><strong>16 angle - phone booth 16</strong>: Sherman drags Marshall to
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>16 continued: 16</strong>: They are both already soaking wet.
Sherman dials a number. A woman answers.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria! Hello. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh. Sorry. May I speak to Maria?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: 17 INT. McCOY APARTMENT - JUDY - NIGHT
17</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. apartment building - sherman - night 20</strong>: is
dragging Marshal back into the building.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, we’re back!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, you were right. I got soaking wet and
Marshall didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, if you want to talk to somebody named
Maria, why do you call me instead?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: If I what? Whatever do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Please don’t lie. It makes your forehead
crinkle.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: About what? Wait a minute. What are we
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You should see your face. It’s a veritable
roadmap of tension and deceit.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m sorry, but I don’t get it. Have I
missed something?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Darling, the only thing you’re missing is
common sense. You’re going to stand there and tell me you didn’t call
here and ask to speak to some Maria?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You think I don’t know your voice?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy, I was out walking the dog. I was not
on the telephone.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m not lying. I took Marshal for a walk,
and I come back in here and wham – I mean I hardly know what to say.
You’re asking me to prove a negative proposition.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: ‘Negative proposition’?! Oh, God, Sherman.
Listen to the way I sound. Listen to the stress. Can you hear it? I
don’t want to be this person. I don’t. I am thin. I am beautiful. I
don’t deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: There’s the phone. Why don’t you just call her
from here? I don’t care. I really don’t care. You are cheap and rotten
and a liar, and you are dripping on the Aubusson carpet.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She was right, of course. And Sherman knew
it. Christ. How could he have been so stupid? A simple phone call…</p>
<p><strong>24 angle - sherman 24</strong>: descending the five-foot wide
walnut staircase that leads from the second floor to the marble foyer.
In this view, we can see that Sherman McCoy – like his surroundings – is
impeccably designed and dressed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The next morning, Judy’s words were still
ringing in his ears. Cheap. Rotten. And a liar. Alright. But was it
really his fault. In a way she had brought it on herself, hadn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Campbell, honey. Are we ready?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Slow down. Where’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Campbell!</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: She’s crying on the lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: On the lifecycle again. You see? Like all
those other women she spends so much time with. So drawn, so pale. You
could see lamplight through their bones…</p>
<p><strong>25 angle - judy 25</strong>: approaches them looking pale and
thin and drawn, dressed in exercise clothes, sweating and still crying.
She looks like she’s spent a sleepless night.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: She won’t kiss me because I’m all wet.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Campbell, kiss your mother.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was still a young man, in the season of
the rising sap. He deserved more than these… these … social X-rays. And
she was turning into one of them!</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. apartment building - sherman and campbell - day
27</strong>: come out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dragging themselves to their sports training
classes, they keep themselves so thin, they look like X-ray pictures.
Sports-trained to death.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: ’Morning, Mr. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: ’Morning, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Bill, sir. My name is Bill.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes, of course. Campbell, say hello to
Tony.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Hi, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: ’Morning, Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>28a angle - sherman 28a</strong>: puts Campbell on a school
bus. The bus pulls away…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sherman was a master of the universe. He
deserved better.</p>
<p><strong>29 omitted 29</strong>: thru thru 31 31</p>
<p><strong>32 int. bond trading room - sherman - day 32</strong>: walks
into the chaos and moves through the din, a smile of pleasure and
anticipation on his lips. We catch bits of conversation.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I said pick up the fucking phone, please.
I’m asking nice. I’m asking you to pick up the fucking phone.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: If you can’t see the goddamn screen,
then I can’t help you. If you can’t see what the hell we’re talking
about, then what are we talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: Well, then why do you think everybody’s
stripping the twenty years?!</p>
<p><strong>fourth man</strong>: Bid eight and a half. And then I want
you to work hard on this, see what’s happening with the escrow, do they
forfeit or no?</p>
<p><strong>fifth man</strong>: This Goldman order really fucked things
up. And the banks are calling it 73. Why are they pissing on us like
that?</p>
<p><strong>sixth man</strong>: Look, look, look. Let me say this again
so we’re clear. I want the turkey rice soup. I don’t want the chicken
rice, I want the turkey rice!</p>
<p><strong>seventh man</strong>: I’m telling you somebody’s painting you
a fucking picture! Can’t you see that?! I’m telling you to swap them.
You got all this downside protection if the Jap market rallies. Just do
it, do it, do it!</p>
<p><strong>34 angle - sherman 34</strong>: approaches his own desk, his
own telephone, his own computer terminals. He dials a number.</p>
<p><strong>taped voice</strong>: Hi. This is 555-8771. Leave a message
and I will get back to you as soon as is humanly possible.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, where are you? I’ve been trying to
reach you for days. Please call me at the office. I have to speak to
you.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Gene’s on from London. Let’s go! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Calm down, Rawlie. Let’s not get
over-excited.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Yes, Sherman. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Calm. Cool. Colated. Let’s not lose our
composure over a few hundred million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Jesus Christ, Sherman. You must be made of
ice.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Just remember, Rawlie. A frantic salesman
is a dead one. A dead one, Rawlie.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: But what the hell is this crazy Giscard deal
going to cost us, Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I need six hundred million to buy up the
bonds…</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Jesus. You want us to sit on six hundred
million dollars worth of French government bonds?!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m confident on this, Gene. It’s a real
sleeping beauty.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Where are you, Gene?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Tottenham Park. At a cricket match. Somebody’s
just hit the hell out of the ball. The ball’s kind of dead, though.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Who’s playing?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Don’t get technical on me, Rawlie. Bunch of
nice young men in white flannel pants.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What do you say, Gene. Are we in or
out?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Gold has to hold steady. And if the franc
starts to drop…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Bernard Sachs is already in for three
hundred million. Does that make you feel better?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Sherman, you’re going to make me an old
man.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: A rich old man, Gene. A rich old man.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What was that? Oh. It’s over. Is it over? The
game’s over. Well. That’s that, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I guess you had to be there. Eh, Gene?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What? What was that?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: At ease, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>36 angle - sherman 36</strong>: moving through the bond
trading room to his desk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The roar enveloped him. Music to his ears.
The sound of educated young white men baying for money on the bond
market. Six hundred million in his hands. Six million off the top for
Pierce &amp; Pierce. One point seven million for Sherman. All in a day’s
work. He was there. At the top – impervious, untouchable, insulated by
wealth and power. A great height from which to view the rest of the poor
world. A great height from which to fall.</p>
<p><strong>36a angle - fax machine 36a</strong>: SPITTING OUT the
message: “Sherman, Arriving New York on the Concorde tonight. Best,
Maria.”</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, you are an absolute angel coming all
the way out here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I had to talk to you. I did the most stupid
thing last night.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, dear. Are we going to talk about it right
now?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. We have to.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Don’t you want a little poon tang first?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria. Please. This is important.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Alright. Tell mama all about it.</p>
<p><strong>40 ext. mercedes - night 40</strong>: moving off the Van Wyck
and onto the Grand Central Parkway.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. mercedes - sherman and maria - night 41</strong>:
Maria is laughing. She is fiddling with the back of Sherman’s neck and
chewing on his ear while her other hand is in his crotch. Maria is
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I know it has its funny side but it isn’t
funny.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well, it’s your own fault for getting caught
like a red herring.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You mean red-handed.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: That’s what I said… Couldn’t we just forget
about your wife and go on over to our little hideaway on 59th Street and
hide away a little?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I think she knows.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well, of course she knows. That’s not the
point.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman, honey. You are so sweet. I could
eat you alive, if I could get this zipper down. Sherman, aren’t we
supposed to turn there?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>42 his pov - sign 42</strong>: reading “Manhattan” way off to
the right, several full lanes away.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m sure that’s the turnoff to Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, I can’t get over there now. We’ll
have to exit and get back on.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. mercedes - night 47</strong>: is suddenly off the
expressway and driving at ground level – a dark street, piled at one
side with car tires – totally bleak.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, where are we?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We’re in the Bronx.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It means we’re going north. All I need to
do is make a left and go west and find a street back to Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>50 angle - street life 50</strong>: surrounds the car –
people, MUSIC, cars, colors. A boulevard of dizzy sounds and sights.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. mercedes - sherman and maria - night 51</strong>: As
it stops for a red light.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Where are all the white people?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Christ. She’s not touching the car, is
she?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, I’m from the South and I’m beginning
not to like this very much.</p>
<p><strong>54 prostitute 54</strong>: leans on the hood of the car,
stands up and continues her pursuit of the pimp.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me, please don’t touch the car.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, get us out of here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I have a red light.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hey, baby. We having a party?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Drive, Sherman. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. mercedes - night 57</strong>: leaps across the
intersection and continues down the boulevard.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Look, there’s no need to panic.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: That’s what you think. I have all my luggage
with me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I just don’t want to do anything stupid. If
we keep our heads, we’ll be perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Christ. We’re in the middle of a goddamn war
zone and you’re worried about doing the right thing. Look! There!</p>
<p><strong>59 ext. street - sign 59</strong>: reads “895 EAST GEO. WASH.
BRIDGE.” And just beyond the sign, a ramp leading up to the
expressway.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: There! George Washington Bridge, you see
it?!</p>
<p><strong>maria - night</strong>: As Sherman pulls toward the ramp.
Another pothole jolts the car. Maria’s luggage flies forward, hitting
Sherman in the back of his neck. At the same time, Maria sees something
in the road ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman! What’s that?!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s a body.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It looks like…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s an animal.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I think it’s a…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Is it dead?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It’s a wheel, that’s all. It’s a tire.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It’s a dead tire!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Calm down, Maria. Please. It’s a tire and
some ash cans or something.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, I can’t drive around it, can I?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You’re going to move it?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. That’s exactly what I’m going to
do.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: For God’s sake, be careful of your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>61 ext. mercedes - sherman - night 61</strong>: gets out of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>61 continued: 61</strong>: He leaves the door open. Above
him, the tremendous CLANGING noise of CARS POUNDING along the
expressway. But he can’t see them. He can only hear them and feel their
vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the
place and of his own situation – the tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A
little chill of lone- liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the
tire – a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman!</p>
<p><strong>63 his pov - two figures 63</strong>: walking toward him. One
big, young, powerfully built . He looks dangerous. The other slight,
hesitant, a few steps behind the first one . They are both black.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Yo! Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>64 quick cuts - scene 64</strong>: Sherman is standing there
holding the tire. The two young men are moving steadily toward him.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What happened, man? You need some help?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No thanks. Hi. No, I don’t think so.
No. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>64 continued: 64</strong>: He starts to move toward the car,
still carrying the tire. Roland steps in front of him. They both keep
moving.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Where you going with that tire?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh. Is this yours? Here. You take it.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh. Sorry. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>65 angle - maria 65</strong>: HONKS the HORN again and drives
the car toward Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>68 angle - maria 68</strong>: opens the car door for
Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, get in this car.</p>
<p><strong>69 angle - sherman 69</strong>: jumps into the car, pulls the
door shut and hits the lock mechanism just as…</p>
<p><strong>72 angle - maria 72</strong>: hits the brakes and puts the
car into reverse.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>76 his pov - henry 76</strong>: moving around the rear end of
the car.</p>
<p><strong>77 angle - maria and sherman 77</strong>: Maria pulls the
wheel hard to the right. The car fishtails.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Be careful. There’s…</p>
<p><strong>78 his pov - rear of car 78</strong>: as before – except that
Henry is gone. Roland is run- ning after the car.</p>
<p><strong>82 ext. mercedes - night 82</strong>: pulls off the Drive
onto 59th Street. The car pulls into a parking space. Sherman and Maria
get out. They move toward a brownstone apartment building.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I wonder if we should report this to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The police?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I mean we were almost robbed and I think
maybe it’s possible you… we hit one of them. There was this kind of…
There was this sound. Did you hear it? Like we hit one of them.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Did you see him get hit?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Neither did I. So if the question ever comes
up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us
and we got away. That’s all we know.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. brownstone - sherman and maria - night 83</strong>:
climbing the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But if we called the police now…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes, let’s call them and invite them over
here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us.
The police and the press and all the rest of the ‘mediarites.’</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Meteorites?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes. Newspapers, radios, televisions. I can
see it now. Mr. Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue and Mrs. Arthur Ruskin of
Fifth Avenue, recuperating after their adventures in the Bronx – explain
that to your wife.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. You have a point.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’d just feel better if…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You don’t have to feel better, Sherman. I was
the one who was driving. And I’m saying I didn’t hit anybody, and I’m
not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you
will support me in that decision.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We were in the jungle… we were attacked… we
fought our way out.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It’s true. We could have been killed.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We fought. I feel like an animal.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You drove the hell out of that car.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The hard part was getting into the seat,
getting over that gear shift.</p>
<p><strong>84 continued: 84</strong>: She opens his shirt. She is
suddenly all over him.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It was instinct.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: That tire…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: He was big… wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You were bigger, Sherman. You were great…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We were both great.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This could be the best sex we’ve had in a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t know. I still think…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Don’t think, Sherman. Don’t think. Just
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>85 int. courtroom - statue - day 85</strong>: A thirty foot
rendition of “blind justice” – a gigantic woman with the scales of
justice in one hand and a bronze sword in the other.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Mr. Sonenberg!?!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Where is Mister Son-nenberg?</p>
<p><strong>87 continued: 87</strong>: – children running about as if
they were in a day care center, clumps of people in the spectator
section waiting their turn, people talking, going in and out paying
little attention to the Judge until…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Where the hell is Mister
Son-nen-berg!!!</p>
<p><strong>88 angle - judge whit 88</strong>: addresses the
DEFENDANT.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Alright, Mr. Lockwood, you sit down.
And if and when your lawyer deigns to favor us with his presence…</p>
<p><strong>lockwood</strong>: Two to six, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>lockwood</strong>: Two weeks ago he told me two to six…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Mr. Lockwood…</p>
<p><strong>lockwood</strong>: Two to six or we go to trial…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Nobody wants to go to trial,
Mr. Lockwood.</p>
<p><strong>lockwood</strong>: I’ll go to trial.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Listen, you son of a bitch. You’re a
nice boy, you’re young, you got a lot going for you. Try to understand
me. We got 7,000 felony indictments in the Bronx every year. And we got
room for 650 trials. And you are not going to be one of them.</p>
<p><strong>lockwood</strong>: I go to trial.</p>
<p><strong>89 angle - jed kramer 89</strong>: coming into the courtroom
and moving toward Ray Andriutti.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: You go sit down, that’s what you go do!
And when your asshole lawyer shows up, you’re gonna take whatever plea
bargain we give you and you’re gonna kiss my ass and thank me that I
didn’t put you away for twenty-five years. Which, if this case ever did
come to trial is exactly what you would get. Now get out of my face.</p>
<p><strong>91 angle - kramer 91</strong>: sits at the table next to Ray
Andriutti. As they talk, Kramer takes a pair of black shoes out of a
plastic bag. He takes off the Reeboks that he’s wearing and puts the
shoes on.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He pulled a knife on a seventy- year-old lady,
robbed her, raped her and then shoved her in a garbage can.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Welcome to the South Bronx.</p>
<p><strong>92 angle - the scene 92</strong>: as the Clerk announces the
next case.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: People versus Harold Williams. Indictment
number 294721.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: This case was dismissed three weeks
ago.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go get him, tiger.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: What is this case doing here?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: May I approach the bench, Your Honor?</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Uh, Kramer, sir. Assistant District…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: You’re new here, Mr. Kramer. Let me
explain something to you. This case is what we call a piece of shit.
Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Your Honor, the District Attorney,
Mr. Weiss…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: I know who the district attorney is. I
know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case
is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice
big house in Riverdale.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I don’t follow, sir…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Because this is an election year.
Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are
black and the other ninety-nine percent don’t even speak English. But
they do vote.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: So Mr. Weiss, your boss, the District
Attorney – who dreams every night that someday he is going to be mayor
of New York City – what he needs is a white man. He needs to find him,
book him, and throw him in jail. Then he looks good to everybody. The
press likes it, the voters like it, even your mother will like it. You
follow me now, Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: So you go tell your boss, the district
attorney, Captain Ahab Weiss that I know he’s out there looking for the
great white defendent… but Mr. Williams over there is not it.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. corridor - kramer and andriutti - day 93</strong>:
come out of the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe he didn’t like your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you Andriutti?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. What?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m Martin. This is Detective Goldberg. We
just come from Lincoln Hospital. You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, what do you got?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We got a kid named Henry Lamb, showed up at
the hospital last night with a broken wrist.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So they fixed him up in the emergency room
and they sent him home.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So this morning his mother brings him back,
he’s got a concussion. He goes into a coma and now they classify him
likely to die.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: You talked to him?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. He was already out.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: He’s in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. There’s a nurse there busting my balls.
She says the kid told his mother he was hit by a car. A Mercedes. And
the car left the scene.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Hit and run.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: The mother tell you this, too?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The mother won’t talk to us. She’s got a
shitload of parking tickets and she doesn’t want to talk to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So why are you coming to us? You got a victim
who’s unconscious, you got no witness, no driver – you got what we call
here a piece of shit. Ain’t that right, Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What we got here is a problem.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: You ever hear of Reverend Bacon?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, no. Not me. Kramer, this is all yours. I’ll
see you gentlemen later.</p>
<p><strong>95 omitted 95</strong>: &amp; &amp; 96 96</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: This is a tragedy. A fine young man has been
struck down. God- fearing, church-going, never in trouble, graduating
from high school, ready for college – and somebody comes along – some
rich white people in a rich white man’s car and wham! They run him down
and never even stop. Now what are we going to do about these parking
tickets?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Well, uh… first of all, Reverend … Is it
Reverend?</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Is, was, and always will be.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: First of all, Reverend, we have no evidence
of…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: This is your evidence…</p>
<p><strong>98 angle to include mrs. annie lamb 98</strong>: coming up
the aisle behind them.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Oh, sorry, ma’am. I didn’t see…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Mrs. Lamb is not speaking to the police.
Until we have proper counsel, I will speak for her.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Alright, then. Let me see if I have this
straight. The boy was hit by a car…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: On Bruckner Boulevard. Innocently walking
along, minding his own business… A clear case of hit-and-run.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: No, Reverend. I’m sorry. But you see, you
have no witness. Without a witness, there’s no case of anything at
all.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: You got what he told his mother.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: That’s hearsay. You may believe it and I may
believe it, but it’s not admissable in a court of law.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: If this boy was born on Park Avenue and he
was run down by two niggers in a Pontiac Firebird, then you’d have a
case! Wouldn’t you?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I work Park Avenue and I work Bruckner
Boulevard, Reverend. There’s good and bad in both places. Now we’ll do
everything we can for this lady. But we don’t have a hell of a lot to go
on.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Gentlemen, I want you to make an investment
here. An investment in steam control.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Steam control?</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: That’s right. Steam control. Because a
righteous steam is building up in the souls of my people and that steam
is ready to blow.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I see. Well…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Now, on judgment day, I am your safety valve.
Because when it blows – and it will, my friend – how grateful you will
be that I am on your side – the one nigger who can control the steam and
save your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so
to speak.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: You think this car was driven by a white
man, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: I seldom think. I just plain know.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Well, Reverend. I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: The next time you gentlemen hear from us, it
will be through our lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lamb</strong>: He said it started with an ‘R.’ That was
the first letter. The second letter was an ‘E’ or a ‘B’ or maybe a ‘P.’
Those were the first two letters of the license plate. If that’s any
help to you.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. road - license plate - day 99</strong>: of Sherman’s
Mercedes – RPH 633.</p>
<p><strong>100 angle - car 100</strong>: approaching Southampton.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. car - sherman 101</strong>: is driving. Judy and
Campbell are with him. No one is talking. Then…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We should move out here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Have you ever thought, I mean, what if we
moved out of New York? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Do you think we could leave New York?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: My father did it.</p>
<p><strong>jduy</strong>: You are not your father.</p>
<p><strong>peter fallow</strong>: She knew how to hurt a guy. No. He was
nothing like his father. His father, the lion of Dunning, Sponget and
Leach. His father, who took the subway to work every day of his life.
His father, who still believed in principals and ethics, whose repeated
lessons concerning duty, debt and responsibility had whistled through
his son’s head. No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, what are you looking for in that
newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Nothing. I… uh… no, nothing special.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: But what’s a bond?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: A bond is a way of lending people money.
Let’s say you want to build a road or a hospital and you need a lot of
money. Well, you issue a bond…</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Do you build roads?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No, I don’t actually build them… I think
you’re in over your head.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn’t build
roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for
the people who raise the money.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: That’s what he said. Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice
of cake. Now you didn’t bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody
a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off.
And you’re allowed to keep those crumbs.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Crumbs? Really…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. And that’s what Daddy does. He passes
somebody else’s cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to
imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden
crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every
little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That’s what Daddy does.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, you can call them crumbs if you want
to…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s the best I can do. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Well… Now it’s not about anything, is
it? Except the money.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We’re having a little… It’s nothing
serious. Really.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Of course, up to this point in our story, I
was blissfully ignorant. I had no idea of the storm that was gathering.
Never even heard of Sherman McCoy. Hadn’t the faintest notion that soon
his name would be inexorably tied to mine. That his fate would be
inextricably bound to my own destiny.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I had my own problems. And I simply had no
idea that Sherman McCoy was the solution I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Caroline. You devil. Come and have a drink
with us.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Peter. You pig. I’m with someone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. And a very pretty someone he is,
too.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: This is Filippo Chirazzi, the artist. This
is Peter Fallow, the has-been.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Enchante. We’re a little crowded.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why don’t you squeeze in next to Billy
Cortez. Billy, you keep your hands to yourself. Now, Filippo, you sit
down on top of Billy and I’ll see if I can get Caroline to sit down on
my face.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: No thanks, Peter. The last time I sat on
your face, I ended up with a yeast infection.</p>
<p><strong>106 angle - gerald moore 106</strong>: standing over
Peter.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: Good evening, Peter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Gerald. Well. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: No, don’t get up. You know my daughter, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Evelyn. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: This is one of my invisible employees. One of
the many journalists who are supposed to be writing for my newspaper.
You’re very fortunate to see him because I hardly ever do.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Gerald, have a drink. Please, I can
explain.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: Thanks, no. We’re having a private little
dinner in the back.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ah. Yes. Well…</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: You know, I was at a dinner party last night.
And in the middle of the pudding, this four-year-old child came in
pulling a toy wagon around the table and on the wagon was a fresh turd.
Her own, I suppose. And the parents just shook their heads and
smiled.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Incroyable!</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: I’ve made a big investment in you, Peter.
Time and money. And it’s not working. Now I could just shake my head and
smile. But in my house, when a turd appears, we deal with it. We dispose
of it. We flush it away. We don’t put it on the table and call it
caviar.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I see. Yes. Yes, of course. Well, I am on to
something right now… and I think I’ve got… it’s just a matter of… this
is something that is really going to break open!</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: I sincerely hope so, Fallow. I sincerely hope
so. Come, Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It was the end of the road for me. I could
see it coming. See it coming? Christ, it was here!</p>
<p><strong>107 ext. street - peter fallow - dawn 107</strong>: is
sitting on a park bench. He’s been up all night. He staggers across the
street into the City Light newspaper office…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’d had my chance and I’d blown it away in a
bottle. It was over. And I had to face up to that fact.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I could always go back home. Small town,
small newspaper. Or I could take the time off, write a novel or two. Or
I could slit my wrists. This last suggestion actually seemed the most
appealing because, in fact, it required the least amount of effort.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And then the telephone rang.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hello? Peter Fallow speaking.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Peter? Albert Fox. Yeah. You sound terrific.
Any pulse? Ha. Ha! I called the office, but nobody seemed to know where
you were or even who you were. Anything I should know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Nothing to know, I’m working at home today,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Good, good, good. I got something I want to
talk to you about, Peter. I think there’s a hell of a story in it…</p>
<p><strong>110 omitted 110</strong>: thru thru</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: … and the cause of these little people will
always be dear to my heart, whether it be discrimination or job security
or simply the right to have urinals at the proper height so that
accidents like this do not happen.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Have you ever thought of giving up the law
and becoming an actor?</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: I am an actor.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And a damn good one too.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: Well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>albert</strong>: When the rights of any people are threatened
– no matter how big or how small – Albert Fox will always be on the
case.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Your help is greatly appreciated, Albert.
Not only by us but by all Americans.</p>
<p><strong>voice from booth</strong>: And cut. Thank you, ladies and
gentlemen. And thank you, Albert Fox, for being our guest.</p>
<p><strong>114d angle - peter fallow 114d</strong>: on the sidelines,
looking through a folder of papers.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Cute, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh… yes.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: And they weigh a ton. You want a drink? You
look like you could use one.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. No. No. No. No. Thanks. No.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Do you want to cancel City College?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No. I got to do it. It’s important. For one
thing, it’s the only place I can still get laid. These girls all want to
sleep with their fathers. And if you’re old and famous, and you know how
to use a condom they’ll fuck your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>114e ext. studio - night 114e</strong>: Fox, Peter and the
Assistant come outside and descend the escalator..</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You look at the Henry Lamb material?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, yeah, but… Look, it’s an unfortunate
situation. But I’m not altogether sure there’s a story in it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A poor, innocent black kid, walking down the
street, minding his own business. And boom! Hit and run. There’s a story
in it for somebody, Peter. The black community is up in arms. And I’m
telling you, when Reverend Bacon gets a feather in his ass, the shit
flies high.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I see. Yes, but what’s your interest
exactly?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’m a lawyer, Peter. I want to see justice
done. That’s all. And, of course, Reverend Bacon is a friend of mine.
This would be good for him. And knowing a little about your situation, I
thought if you were the one to break the story…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My situation?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Your boss was at my house for dinner the other
night. He said a few things…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you have a daughter?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yes. I do. A little girl.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Does she have a little toy wagon?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Yes. I think she does. Yes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll have a Scotch and water.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Good. Good. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Too many.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I could lose my job for this. What are
you going to do with this information?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: You’ll read all about it in the
newspapers. Come on. Let’s do R.E., R.P. and R.B. and see what we
get.</p>
<p><strong>117 ext. long island suburb - ed rifkin - day 117</strong>:
is in his driveway sipping a beer and painting a “For Sale” sign. An ’81
Corvette is parked in the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Henry Lamb? Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In
your English class.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: He was? What’s he done?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was seriously injured. I’m a journalist. I
write for a newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Oh. I don’t remember him.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What I would like to find out is what kind of
student he was.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Well, if I don’t remember him, I guess he
was okay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Would you say he was a ‘good’ student?</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: ‘Good’ doesn’t really apply to Ruppert High.
They’re either cooperative or life-threatening. There’s no
in-between.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: His mother says he was considering going to
college.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Well, she means City College. They have an
open admissions policy. So, if you live in the city and you graduate
from high school and you’re still breathing, they have to take you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, is there anything at all you can tell
me about his performance or aptitude – anything at all?</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Look, Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fallow.</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: I got sixty-five students in every
class…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Do you have any of his written work?</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Oh, Jesus, there hasn’t been any written
work at Ruppert High since… oh, fifteen years. Maybe twenty.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, there must be some record of how he
measures up to the others…</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: No. See, you’re thinking about grades and
honor students and high achievers. We don’t make those kinds of
comparisons. We’re just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert
High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn’t piss
on the teacher.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an
honors student?</p>
<p><strong>rifkin</strong>: Well, he never pissed on me. So by that
standard, yes. I guess he must be.</p>

that to next January or to term or both.</p>

hell, they’re not even problems. So let’s not get ourselves whipped up
into a-a-a coma. Jesus Christ! No, not you, Bernard. Felix, let me see
that paper.</p>
<p><strong>127 continued: 127</strong>: Felix hands him the paper.
Sherman tries to read the article and talk to Bernard at the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: ‘Wait’? What do you mean, ‘wait’?! What the
hell are you talking about? Now you listen to me, Bernard. We can’t
wait! We’ve got to move now! You’re raising phantom issues here. It
doesn’t matter what happens to gold and francs on a day-to-day basis!
We’ve got to pull ourselves together and just fucking do it!! Look,
Bernard. I’m sorry. No. Wait a minute. Wait, Bernard. Bernard! Don’t
leave me! Don’t leave me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But it was too late. It was gone. Six hundred
million dollars. On Wall Street, a frantic salesman was a dead salesman.
And Sherman knew it.</p>

you. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Have you seen this? Have you seen this
perversion of the truth?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Don’t I get a kiss first?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Have you read it?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman, you know I only read the
newspapers spasmodically.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Sporatically, Maria. Sporatically.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes. Me, too. Now come on in and have a
drink. I know just what you need.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Absolutely wrong! All of it. And who is
this Peter Fallow? He has everything wrong. They don’t even mention the
other boy. And what about the ramp and the tire?! They’re talking about
a little saint here who was on his way to get milk and cookies for his
widowed mother.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Excuse me, but what is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: We’re putting in a new intercom system. All
the apartments. The super let me in. Are you…</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Miss Caroline Heftshank? I need you to sign
a receipt.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well, uh… I don’t live here. I’m just a guest
of Miss Heftshank. So…</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Okay. No problem. I’m all done.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Christ. That was close.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Nothing. Caroline pays $351 for this place.
It’s rent controlled. I sublet it for eleven hundred a month. But it’s
not legal. They would love to get Caroline out of here. But they have to
prove she doesn’t live here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You don’t think it’s weird this fellow
showed up today. After that unconscionable piece in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman. You are completely paranoidical.
Look, I have to leave for the airport in twenty minutes. So we don’t
have much time.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You don’t think they could possibly trace
the car to me?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: How? They don’t have the full number, they
don’t have a witness, and the only one who could recognize you is in
terminal comatosis.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Right. There is the other boy, however.
Suppose he came forward.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: If he was gonna materialize, he would have
done it by now. And the reason he hasn’t, is because he’s a criminal.
Would you get my blue jacket out of that closet?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What a wretched painting.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Filippo Chirazzi. He’s a friend of Caroline.
Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I hope not. God, Maria, it looks like
you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No. No. How could it be? Come on, give me a
hand. I’m taking it with me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The airport. I told you. I have a car coming
in – oh, God, ten minutes. We have time for a quickie. What do you
say?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m upset, Maria. I just lost 600 million
dollars. And possibly my job. I don’t feel terrifically sexy at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You know I’m a sucker for a soft dick.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, you are incorrigible.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I suppose we could still go to the police.
We could get a very talented lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And put our heads right into the horse’s
mouth? I’m the one who was driving the car. Don’t you think I’m the one
who should make the decision? And I say, no. No, Sherman. Trust me.
Nothing is going to come of this little newspaper article. Absolutely

understand me? I could have had every newspaper and T.V. station
spreading this news thinly, too thinly across the airways. But I have
chosen only you two. And I expect big coverage, in-depth coverage.</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: Well, then let’s get to work.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, Reverend, aren’t you afraid we may be
trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill here? I mean, honestly…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Honesty has nothing to do with this,
Mr. Fallow. This is show business. And I’ve never known the two to go
hand in hand.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, I am a journalist…</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: You’re a drunk, Mr. Fallow. That’s what I’ve
been told. And you’re almost out of a job. Aren’t you? Or am I
misinformed?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think maybe you’ve got the wrong man,
here.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Oh, I don’t think so. I don’t think so at
all. Get with the program, Mr. Fallow, you may have been a knight in
shining armour back in Kansas. But this is New York City. And I’m
telling you, when you come to work in a whore house, there’s only one
thing you want to be – and that’s the best whore in the house.</p>

crowd.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Brothers and sisters. I stand before you with
a heart that is broken. And I stand before you with a heart that is
angry. Heart broken because our brother, our neighbor, our son, Henry
Lamb has been stuck down in the prime of his young life. And now he lies
in a hospital, broken like my heart. But my heart is also angry. Angry
because the driver of that car did nothing for him! And neither did the
police. And neither did this man – Mr. Abraham Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: This man has turned his back on Henry Lamb.
And I, for one, am not going to stand for it. No sir!</p>
<p><strong>148a angle - buck 148a</strong>: passing out placards to
Rev. Bacon’s audience. “Weiss justice is white justice.” “Lamb
slaughtered by indifference.” “Hit ‘n’ run ‘n’ lie to the people.”</p>

Bacon is speaking.</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: He’s something, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. He certainly is.</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: But, listen, he’s on the level with this
one, isn’t he? I mean this is a legitimate story.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh. Yes. Sure. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: I mean this Henry Lamb is… was … is a nice
kid. No record, neighbors seem to like him, an honor student.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No question about it.</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: Because, well, I don’t give a shit, but
he’s gonna be a saint by the time we get through with him. So it would
be good if it were true. You know?</p>
<p><strong>148c angle - annie lamb 148c</strong>: is being led by

Bacon puts Annie in front of the crowd as if he were introducing a queen

throwing shit right in my face!</p>
<p><strong>corsaro</strong>: And while authorities are dragging their
feet, the protesters were sending a message to Bronx district attorney
and mayoral candidate Abe Weiss – ‘If you don’t launch an investigation,
we’ll do it ourselves!’</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: That’s my name. That’s my own fucking

<p><strong>fox</strong>: I am here to join with the black community in
expressing not only its grief but also its outrage. And, of course,
whatever I can do to help Mrs. Lamb, I will do.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Now they’ve got Albert Fox with them.</p>
<p><strong>anchorwoman</strong>: … while at the same time, sources at
Motor Vehicle say there are less than 200 Mercedes with plates beginning
with the key letters… RE, RB or RP. There was no comment from the
District Attorney’s office about Reverend Bacon’s demand for justice.
Meanwhile, protestors are threatening if Bronx district attorney and
mayoral candidate Abe Weiss doesn’t launch an investigation – Quote
‘We’ll do it ourselves!’</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: And how did they get this information out of
Motor Vehicle? Whose side are they on?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Calm down, Abe. We had this information a week
ago.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Then why aren’t we doing anything? Why aren’t
we tracing the car? What am I, the Wizard of Oz, I don’t know
anything!?</p>

witness. We don’t even know where it happened. We don’t even know if it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Trace the car, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We don’t have a case, even if we find the car.
Even if we find the owner and the owner says, oh, yeah, gee, yeah, I hit
this kid, yeah, the other night, and yeah I didn’t stop and I didn’t
report it. I did it. I did it. Then we have a case.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Just trace the fucking car.</p>

And the Wasps. They love this shit more than anybody. They love laughing

<p><strong>weiss</strong>: All the rich sons of bitches. They still
think they own this city. They sit in their co-ops, Park Avenue, Fifth,
Beekman Place, snug like a bug, twelve-foot ceilings, one wing for them,
one for the help. They think money is going to protect them? Stupid sons
of bitches. I’d like to light a bonfire under all their lily-white
asses. Let them see what this feels like. Let the whole Third World see
the smoke and come after them. Let them feel what it’s like when every
Puerto Rican, West Indian, Cuban, Korean, Chinese, Albanian, Filippino,
black man from every corner of every borough – you don’t think the
future knows how to cross a bridge? You laugh. You laugh. Alright. Now
this is what we’re going to do. We’re going to turn this thing around.

Hymie. By November, they’re going to be thinking of me as the first
black District Attorney of Bronx County. They’re going to beg me to be
mayor. We’re going to walk away with that election. That’s what we’re

we gotta look for the car. And that means bothering a lot of innocent
people. We’re sorry about the inconvenience. But it’s a routine sort of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I understand. But if it is a routine, well,
I should, I guess I ought to… well, follow the routine that’s
appropriate to me, to someone with a car in this situation. You see?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No. I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, I mean, if you have a routine in an
investigation like this – I don’t know how these things work, but there
must also be a routine for a person like me, an owner of a car with a
license number – I think that’s what I need to consider. The
routine.</p>

tell us. Before things get complicated.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No. I just think… I think that, just to be
sure, certain, safe… I think…</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Let me put it this way, if you want to
cooperate, that’s great. If you have reasons for not cooperating, then I
should tell you that you don’t have to say anything. That’s your right.
If you want, you can say nothing at all. You also have the right to an
attorney. I mean, for that matter, if you lacked the ‘funds’ for an
attorney, the state would provide you with one – free of charge. If
that’s what you wanted.</p>

should… I should talk this over with an attorney.</p>

Ain’t that the truth, Marty?</p>

shit?</p>

<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I think he’s the type we could smoke out.
Bring him in for questioning. Go public.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go public?! You got nothing here. Your only
witness is in a hospital likely to die. Don’t listen to this shit, Abe.
You got to get to Manhattan. You got a speech to make.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I’ll tell you what you got to do, sir.
You’ve got to send a signal out to the poor people of this city. You got
to let them know that justice is blind. You got to let them know that if
you’re white and rich, you get the same treatment you get when you’re
black and poor. You got to give people hope!</p>

from a tube down his throat.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: No. But maybe he can point.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Point?</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Yeah. I got an idea. We take a picture of
Sherman McCoy over to the hospital, to this kid. And three or four other
guys, white guys, and we put them by the bed, the pictures. And the kid
comes to… and he points to McCoy’s picture. And he keeps pointing…</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Might work. That might work. It’s a long
shot, but it might work.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Mr. Kramer?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yeah? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’ll kill him. He wakes up out of a coma and
sees four white men in suits and ties staring at him from the end of the
bed, he’ll shit and die.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: It’s worth a try.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t believe what I’m hearing! Some poor
gook with a tube down his throat pointing at a picture. That’s your
case?! It’s never gonna stand up.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: I know that, Ray. I know that. I just want to
bring the guy in! Just bring him in. That’s all. We get the press. We
get the attention. Then we can relax and do the right thing.</p>

No. We cannot do that. No way.</p>

<p><strong>killian</strong>: I believe you. It was a set-up. They were
going to take you off. Sounds to me like he’s got good reasons not to
come forward. You just sit tight. That’s what you do.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Look, you were recommended as the best
criminal lawyer around. I’m not disagreeing with you. But I didn’t come
here to… I mean, I want to pre-empt this whole situation. I don’t want
it to go any further.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: It means I want to take the initiative. I
want to go to the police with Maria – Mrs. Ruskin – and just tell them
exactly what happened. I mean, I don’t know about the law, but I feel
morally certain that we did what was right – in the situation we were
in. And I don’t see…</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Ayyyy! You Wall Street honchos are real
gamblers. Ayyy! Whaddaya whaddaya! They would devour you. They would eat
you up.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Forget it’s already a political football.
Forget the T.V. and Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an election coming up.
Forget that and remember that when you work in the D.A.’s office and
every day you prosecute people with names like Tiffany Latour and Sancho
Rodriguez and Chong Wong and Shabazz Kazan Tamali, you are dying to get
your hands on a nice white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin. Biscuit
city, ehhh! You open your mouth and they will arrest you. And they will
make a big show out of arresting you. And it will be very
unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>180 continued: 180</strong>: Sherman sits down. He is
depressed. The PHONE RINGS.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: That is guaranteed. Believe me, you do not
want to be arrested in the South Bronx. Yeah. Oh. Put him on. Yeah? I’ll
hold. I need to talk to your friend, Mrs. Ruskin, too.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I understand you went to Yale.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Yeah. You, too. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What did you think of it?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: It was okay. As law schools go. They give
you the scholarly view. You know. It’s terrific for anything you want to
do – as long as it doesn’t involve real people. Hey, Andruitti, you
guinea, how are you? Yeah. Well, I’m sitting here with Sherman McCoy.
Yeah. That’s right. Well, I don’t know if he needs a lawyer. What do you
think? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what does that mean? Okay. Yeah.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: They’re going to arrest you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Tell him to wait. We’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I know it was six hundred million, Rawlie.
Just stop saying it. I’ll straighten it out with Gene first thing in the
morning. Well, not first thing. I have a previous appointment.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman. Please. What is the matter with you?
You’re not even dressed and the car is already here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What? What car? No, Rawlie, I can’t change
it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Leon and Inez Bavardage. They are taking us to
the opera. Eight o’clock. Tonight. And the car is here.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Rawlie, I’ll call you later. Just stay
calm. But why do we need a car? They only live six blocks from here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Because after the opera we’re going to the
museum for the Benefit.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We could walk.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t walk down the street in this dress. A
small wind would turn me into a kite.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Then let’s take a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why are we having this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Because a car is going to take us six
blocks and wait there for five and a half hours and then drive us
another six blocks home and it is going to cost us three hundred and
forty-six dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money, Judy. It is pouring out
of us with every beat of our heart. Isn’t that worth talking
about?!?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re right. It might be cheaper in the long
run to hire a permanent chauffeur.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy, please…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’ll talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We have to talk now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We can’t hire a chauffeur in the next fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We haven’t talked about anything for the
last three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well there’s no reason to start now.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes, there is. Something is happening here.
You have to know about this. Tomorrow morning…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, this is a very important evening. It
will determine whether or not I will be chairman of the museum benefit
this year. I cannot be upset now. We can talk about it later.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m going to be arrested in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Really, Sherman, you’d do anything to ruin
this for me. Wouldn’t you? Now please. Get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>184 int. opera house - onstage - night 184</strong>: The last
scene of Don Giovanni is being played out. The Commandatori has the Don
in his grip, urging him to “repent.” The Don refuses. The MUSIC THUNDERS
threateningly.</p>
<p><strong>187 his pov - text 187</strong>: and the word “repent” in
English and Italian.</p>
<p><strong>188 angle - stage 188</strong>: as the floor opens up around
Don Giovanni. Flames and demons reach for him.</p>
<p><strong>189 angle - sherman 189</strong>: breaking into a sweat. He
reaches for Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>190 angle - stage 190</strong>: as Don Giovanni screams and
falls into the jaws of hell.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey buffing</strong>: There he is, Don Juan, in the vise-
like grip of fate, facing his crime, facing his entire life of selfish
consumption and profligate wasting of himself and others…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re Judy McCoy’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m in real estate. And, darling, I’ve seen
your apartment. Any time you even think about selling…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, it’s unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Have you met Aubrey Buffing the poet? He’s on
the short list for the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Ah. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He has AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: We were talking about the opera…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: ‘The wrath of heaven must be at hand, its
justice will not tarry. I see the deadly thunderbolt poised above his
head! I see the fatal abyss open before him.’</p>
<p><strong>196 his pov - judy 196</strong>: is being introduced to Maria
on the other side of the room.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>198 angle - arthur ruskin 198</strong>: speaking to Judy.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: … My wife lives on airplanes. She goes back
and forth to Italy like a Ping-Pong ball. She took a house on Lake Como.
She’s crazy now all of a sudden for anything Italian.</p>
<p><strong>199 angle - sherman 199</strong>: comes up next to Judy.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh… Judy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman! Have you met Bobby Shalfet, from the
opera? And Nunnally Voyd – oh, and Arthur Ruskin and his wife Maria.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, hi.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: And what do you do, Mr. McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Bonds.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Well, the only bonds I know about are bail
bonds.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I was arrested last year in Montreal for
pissing on a tree…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, couldn’t you try just once, to be a
little bit interesting.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I want you to meet Aubrey Buffing.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: The poet. He’s on the short list for the
Nobel Prize. He has AIDS. You’ll love him.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sherman, we are alone in the middle of the
room. A married couple, talking to each other. You simply don’t do this.
Now go and mingle. Please.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: And even when repentence is offered, he
refuses. He refuses to deny his life. The food, the drink, the flesh –
fatal as they may be – he cannot resist them…</p>
<p><strong>201 angle - maria 201</strong>: talking in French to BORIS
KARLEVSKOV, a ballet dancer. Sherman approaches.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman! We have to stop meeting like this.
Do you know Boris, the ballet dancer?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Boris, je te presente Monsieur McCoy.
Sherman, voila Boris Karlevskov. He’s defective.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You mean he defected.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I mean he doesn’t speak any English.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes. Watch. Boris, darling, would you like me
to eat your ass?</p>
<p><strong>boris</strong>: Encore du champagne, s’il vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You see? It went right over his head.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, I need to talk to you. Something
very… unexpected is happening.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Of course, darling, but keep smiling. My
husband is watching me. Look at him. He’s so pleased with himself. He’s
just closed a new deal. A charter business. He’s going to take Arabs to
Mecca on airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m going to be arrested in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Of course, the airplanes are all from
Israel…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: By the police, I imagine.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He’ll make a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t think it will be too bad. My lawyer
– if you can call him that – has received assurances that it will all be
handled in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He called me a whore today. Right in front of
the servants. I mean, really. How does he expect me to run the house if
he humiliates me in front of the help?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Well. You have a point.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m sorry, Sherman. What are we talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: The other guy has come forward. He says I
was driving the car. I’m going to be arrested tomorrow morning. I need
to know from you … I mean, what do you want me to say?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman, what…?!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bavardage</strong>: Maria, darling, I need your advice
about something. My designer has gone bonkers about jabots and
chintz.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bavardage</strong>: Jabots and chintz, jabots and chintz
everywhere, everywhere!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. bavardage</strong>: Sherman, have you met Aubrey
Buffing? He has AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: Like so many of us now, with death and
retribution waiting for us. Yet we go on whirling about each other…</p>
<p><strong>202 his pov - maria 202</strong>: goes to Arthur, whispers
something in his ear. They leave quickly. For a brief moment, she looks
back at…</p>
<p><strong>203 angle - sherman 203</strong>: walking with Aubrey, trying
to see where Maria went.</p>
<p><strong>aubrey</strong>: We are unable to stop, until death itself
takes us into his arms and burns us with the fever of living, dragging
us like Don Juan into the bonfires of hell. The words of the ghost
ringing in our ears… ‘Repent! Repent!’</p>

<p><strong>killian</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Top notch. Look. You said this was just a
formality.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: No problem. They promised me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I told Maria. I saw her last night. In case
we need her.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: That explains it. She left the country this
morning. You know some Italian painter named Filippo Sharutti, something
like that?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t know. Why?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: I think your girl friend found a new
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: It’s not going to be so bad. This is
routine. I talked to Andruitti again last night. He promised me. We’ll
be in and out of there. No problem. Nobody is ever going to know it
happened.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We got to cuff him.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The zone captain is gonna be there. And the
press.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Wait a minute. What the fuck?! What press?!
I talked to Ray last night. He promised no bullshit.</p>

<p><strong>killian</strong>: Don’t talk. What’s going on here?!</p>
<p><strong>214 angle - crowd 214</strong>: near the door to the building
comes alive. Slowly, at first. They turn their heads toward the car and
then they start moving, walking, running, racing toward the car.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t know me but I’m…</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Jesus Christ! Get out and get that door
open or we’ll never get him out of the fucking car.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Bullshit reigns. Put the cuffs on him.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m going to jail. Aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Let me get out first. Now listen. You don’t
say anything. Don’t cover your face. Don’t hang your head. You don’t
even know they’re there. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>217 ext. car - martin and killian 217</strong>: help Sherman
out of the car and all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p><strong>someone</strong>: Sherman! Hey, shitface. Over here!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Sherman, how you going to plead?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: You ever been arrested before? Who’s the
brunette? What were you doing in the Bronx? Why didn’t you stop,
Sherman? Sherman! This way! This way! How’s your wife taking this,
Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: How much did you make last year? Hey,
fuckhead! How do you like this cocktail party? Why’d you hit him? Give
us a statement. Come on, Sherman, give us a break. Give us a little
something, you fucking racist.</p>
<p><strong>218 angle - sherman 218</strong>: assaulted by cameras,
microphones and people as he is pushed through the metal door. Killian
is being left outside.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Don’t make any statements! Don’t talk to
anybody, especially in the pens! I’ll be upstairs when they bring you up
for arraignment…</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: You may have a long wait, Mr. Killian. If I
have anything to say about it.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Yeah? Fuck you, too, Kramer.</p>

Bend over.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: I ain’t going to touch you. Just bend over
at the waist and back through the gate. Real slow.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Slow. Slow. Slow. A little farther, little
farther. Little farther. Little farther…</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Hey, Martin. Come here. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Okay, Sherman. Do that again. Real
slow.</p>
<p><strong>b222 continued: b222</strong>: Sherman repeats the
humiliating action. When finally his head reaches the gate, the ALARM
SOUNDS again.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: It’s his head! Swear to Christ. It’s his
head. Open your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>goldberg</strong>: Look in there. You want to see some
metal?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Jesus Christ. Set of teeth look like a
change-maker.</p>

<p><strong>judge white</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I am very sorry. Please forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Just say, not guilty.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: For my life. For everything. I am truly
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Your Honor, the defendant is under extreme
stress. He pleads not guilty.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I repent all the sins of my past life. I
repent…</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Just shut up, Sherman. Defendant pleads not
guilty!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Bail has been set at $10,000…</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Your Honor…</p>
<p><strong>spectators</strong>: No bail! No bail! Lock him up! Bang it
shut!</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: We do not believe it will serve the
interests of justice to allow this defendant to go free on a token
bail…</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Your Honor, Mr. Kramer knows very well…</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Given the emotions of the community…</p>

him!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: If your office has information bearing
upon the bail status of this case, I instruct you to make a formal
application. Until then, I am releasing Mr. McCoy under a bond in the
amount of $10,000. Now get this side show out of my court.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Your Honor, your action will do irreparable
damage not only to the People’s case…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Mr. Kramer, I have spoken.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: … But to the cause of the people as
well.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Mr. Kramer…</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: It ill-behooves the criminal justice
system…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Kindly behoove me no

<p><strong>228a ext. courthouse - peter fallow - late afternoon
228a</strong>: is sitting on the steps of the courthouse. He is still
covered with mud from having been trampled earlier. He takes a long swig
from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag. He is drunk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It was too much for me. All of it. Sherman
McCoy had been swept away from me. Before I could even speak to him. And
as the day progressed, I began to appreciate the power, the magnitude of
the force that had been unleashed by my little story.</p>
<p><strong>228b angle - moving crowd 228b</strong>: of reporters,
television people, photographers, etc. They run up the steps past Peter

<p><strong>voices</strong>: It’s over! He’s coming out! Let’s go! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>228c angle - peter 228c</strong>: dodges the onslaught, pulls
himself up, and starts moving in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jackels. Dogs. Yapping at the heels of their
prey. And I was one of them. Well, let them have it. Enough is enough. I
was finished. I summoned what little dignity I had left and decided to
go home…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me, do you know where I can find a
taxi?</p>
<p><strong>228d angle to include sherman mccoy 228d</strong>: who has
just come out the side entrance of the building. Peter is
flabbergasted.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Sherman McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. I know. I know that. What are you…?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I need a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You need to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>228e angle - crowd of reporters 228e</strong>: change
direction and start moving away from the front entrance and toward the

the back! Move! Move! Move!</p>
<p><strong>228f angle - fallow and sherman 228f</strong>: see the mob
moving toward them. Fallow grabs Sherman and pulls him toward a
subway.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This way. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh. I don’t normally ride the subway.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me either. Especially on a first date. But we
don’t really have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>228g int. subway car - sherman and peter - day 228g</strong>:
Sherman is dazed, still in shock. He looks very fragile.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh, fine. Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, I owe you an apology…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No, you were very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: That’s alright. Thanks. I should go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look. Sit down. Just sit down a minute. I’ll
get you home.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Would you like a drink? I happen to have a
little something…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh. No. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go on. Fuck it. What are they going to do?
Arrest you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Does this train go anywhere near Park
Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not in a million years.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: My father took the subway every day of his
life.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah. But he didn’t live in the South Bronx.
Did he?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You look like shit. And you smell, too.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I think, when I was in the jail, I pissed
in my pants.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I can’t think.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s okay. Have another drink.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: … and then this newspaper thing started,
this Peter Fallow person, and all the facts were wrong, total disregard
for the truth. Why do they do this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is you. You’ll be right on Lexington
Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: They call me by my first name. Like they
know me. Like they own me. Newspapers, lawyers, police, people I don’t
even know. How did I get to be so important?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re not important. You’re just dinner. You
know what I mean? And a week from now, a month – nobody is even going to
remember what they ate.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I should have called the police right away,
when it happened. But I couldn’t you see? It wasn’t really my
decision.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I mean, I wasn’t driving the car.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>228-i continued: 228-i</strong>: The doors to the train start
to close. Peter tries to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>230 angle - sherman 230</strong>: stops near the building.
The basketball flies toward him. He catches it. Before anyone sees him,
he enters through the service entrance.</p>
<p><strong>232 int. elevator - sherman - night 232</strong>: looks like
he feels – unclean, unshaven, slightly drunk, his clothes soiled, torn
and disheveled. He seems to stoop slightly under the weight of his
humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>233 angle - elevator doors 233</strong>: open and suddenly we
are in the midst of…</p>
<p><strong>234 angle - party 234</strong>: in high gear. Most of the
guests are recognizable from the previous party at the museum. Sherman
is shocked. But before he can get his bearings…</p>
<p><strong>bobby shalfet</strong>: Sherman! You sly fox. Great to see
you. Everybody! It’s Sherman! Bravo! Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>nunnally voyd</strong>: Sherman, my boy. Whatever you do,
don’t let the newspapers get you down.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fruit flies. That’s all they are. They swarm.
They hover over the faces. You take a swipe at them, they run away.</p>
<p><strong>nunnally voyd</strong>: Yes. But they always come back to the
shit. Don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And I always thought of you as such a dull
person.</p>
<p><strong>man with ponytail</strong>: Sherman, has anybody talked to
you about television?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Uh… no. What?</p>
<p><strong>man with ponytail</strong>: We’d have to play down the racial
thing and try to make you a little more sympathetic. You know,
sympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>235 angle - rawlie thorpe 235</strong>: approaches
Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Sherman. Gee. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Rawlie.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt
anything.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Gene asked me to come by…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yeah. I haven’t really been able to talk to
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: He just wanted you to know, anything we can
do…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh, well. I should be down there in a day
or so…</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Oh, that won’t be necessary. That’s what I
came to… I was sent to tell you. I mean, you don’t have to… I mean, you
shouldn’t come down. I mean, they don’t want you to come down.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh. I see. Well.</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Jesus, Sherman. I’m sorry. But between all
this and the way you handled Bernard on the Giscard deal. I mean, six
hundred million…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: That’s final, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rawlie</strong>: Well, the firm feels…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Yes. Of course. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Judy. What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This is a dinner party. It was planned weeks
ago. If you ever bothered to look at your calendar…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But Judy, I mean, under the
circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. I know the whole story. I heard it – saw
it all on television. On television?!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m sorry. I am. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You betrayed us, Sherman. Me. Campbell. Even
yourself. On the other hand, I am going to chair the museum benefit
thanks to you and your escapades on the public airways. What can I say?
Life goes on. I can only make the best of an absolutely appalling
situation and carry on.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But can you forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I suppose I can forgive anything, but not
television. I’m leaving you, Sherman. After the party. Now if you’ll
excuse me, we have guests.</p>
<p><strong>237 angle - to include sally rawthrote 237</strong>: as she
sails into the kitchen, she sees Judy leave.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh, my darling, is this a bad time?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I beg your pardon…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What am I saying? Of course it’s a bad time.
But I just wanted to see if I can be of any help.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, that’s very kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You know I haven’t been in this apartment
since the McCleods had it. That was before the Kittridges. I hope I’m
not being out of place.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Not at all… uh…</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Sally.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Anyway, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No, really, anything I can do. With the
apartment, is what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: The apartment?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I find people often need to be as liquid as
they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half
right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon – it’s the celebrity
appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn’t
come along every day. You have to ride the wave.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Excuse me. I have to… uh… Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Pollard. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Sorry to interrupt your dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Not at all. The more the merrier.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I’ve been in touch with the co-op board,
well, most of them, and we want you to know you have our support.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You know, at first I wanted to die.
Standing there in court, people calling my name…</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Yes. Of course. Hard to believe.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: And then I thought, I have a gun. Twelve
gauge. Double barrel…</p>
<p><strong>240 int. study - sherman 240</strong>: goes to the closet and
pulls out the shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Sherman, we’ve known each other a long
time. We went to Buckley together. My father knew your father. I speak
as a friend. But also as president of the board. Is that a gun?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I wonder if I can get both barrels into my
mouth. That’s what I was thinking. And how do you pull the trigger. I
read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger
with his toe.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Yes. This can’t be a comfortable situation
for you.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: And where would I do it? Who would find
me?</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Exactly. Yes. Have you considered… changing
residence until things quiet down?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You want me to leave?</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: This is my home…</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I understand that…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: This is the only safe place I have. People
are threatening my life. I have to protect myself.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: There are people demonstrating in front of
our building. Black people with basketballs! You’re putting everyone at
risk. It’s not your fault. But that doesn’t alter the facts.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Alter the facts?! The facts are that I have
no place else to go! And you want me to move out?! Is that what you’re
saying, Pollard. You want me to move out of my home?!</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: You are a shareholder in a cooperative.
Look, we’re not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Why don’t you move out, Pollard? If you’re
so fucking terrified!</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: Sherman, please…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: And you can start by moving out of this
apartment right now. Out! Now!</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I came here in good faith.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat
blowhard at Buckley and you’re a ridiculous fat blowhard now.</p>
<p><strong>pollard</strong>: I will have to enforce the provision
concerning unacceptable situations.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Another word out of you, Pollard, and
there’s going to be an unacceptable situation right up your ass! Now
march!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: And that goes for the rest of you, too.
Out. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>242 angle - sherman 242</strong>: waves the smoking shotgun
at them.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Out! Stinking lot of anorexic parasites.
Get out of my house!</p>
<p><strong>242 continued: 242</strong>: He FIRES another SHOT. The room
clears. Judy comes running from the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Out of my house, out of my life!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Say goodbye to Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: ’Bye, Daddy. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You can see him on television.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Sherman McCoy is dead. Sherman McCoy of
Park Avenue and Wall Street and Southampton – gone. Dead. I will never
be Sherman McCoy again. Never!</p>

<p><strong>248 int. leicester’s - close on peter - night 248</strong>:
who looks very depressed.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That same evening, just a few blocks away, I
was being praised and congratulated. It should have been a very
triumphant yours truly at Leicester’s. But it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: … my little encounter with Sherman McCoy was
spoiling everything. The truth has a way of doing that.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Beautiful stuff, Peter. First rate.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He looks like a real killer, this McCoy fellow.
Doesn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>another woman</strong>: You can see it in the photographs.
You can see it in his chin.</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: Arrogant son a bitch, isn’t he? I hope
they throw the book at him.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Daddy. Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: Yes, darling. Shall we have Peter here come
along with us?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Lovely.</p>
<p><strong>moore</strong>: I want to give this story our full attention,
Peter. It makes us look better and better, the more we do for this Lamb
family. Poor little Lambs, poor little fuzzy-wuzzy wogs.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Excuse me, Peter. There’s a phone call for
you upstairs in the office.</p>
<p><strong>250 int. upstairs office - peter and caroline - night
250</strong>: come into the office.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where’s the phone?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I lied. I wanted to see you alone. I’m
going to do you a favor.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t tell me I’m finally going to get into
your panties.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: You don’t deserve this, Peter. But I’m
going to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen, Caroline. I’m sort of with some
people tonight.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Relax, darling. Do you remember my pretty
little Italian friend? The painter.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Yes, I do. Franco or Federico…</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Filippo. The little shit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Caroline, you’re absolutely soused.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Well, Filippo has run off with a little
slut you should know about.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Caroline, isn’t that dangerous? Or at least
unsanitary?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Shut up, Peter. You’re not listening. Her
name is Maria Ruskin.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: She was subletting my apartment. She was
also subletting Filippo. And, as it turns out, she was also in the car
with Sherman McCoy when the accident happened.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: I never joke. She was in the car.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But how do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: The apartment was bugged. They had a wire
in the intercom. They were trying to prove that I wasn’t living there.
Which I wasn’t. Now I’ve lost the apartment and the boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You don’t know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: No. But I’m trusting you to find them. And
when you do. Give them this. Tell them this is the little lady who
turned them in.</p>
<p><strong>caroline</strong>: Maybe I should advertise…</p>
<p><strong>252 int. restaurant - maitre d’ - day 252</strong>: points
Fallow toward Arthur Ruskin’s table.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Monsieur Ruskin is already here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Arthur. Thanks for meeting me on such short
notice.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Peter Fallow?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. We’ve never met but I’m a good friend
of… your wife.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: My wife! My wife! I’m glad she’s not here.
Otherwise I couldn’t have a drink. Give me a Couvoisier V.S.O.P. No. Put
it in a sidecar.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Uh… where is Maria, by the way?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Italy. Every time I turn around, she’s in
Italy. I’m not supposed to drink. But I love a sidecar. It was Willi
Nordhoff introduced me to them. So. You’re on the City Light?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh, yes. And we’re doing a little profile
piece. We’re calling it the ‘New Tycoons.’ And, naturally, we thought of
you.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good. Good. I like that. New tycoons. So
what do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, there’s no hurry. So Maria is in Italy.
Where abouts?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: She’s in Lake Como someplace.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, there are some great hotels in Lake
Como. Is she at the Excelsior?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: What do I know? I just pay the bills. Well,
she’s young. She needs young people. I’m not stupid. I know what goes
on. We should order. I don’t have too much time.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’d like to talk to her, too. If I could. If
I could get in touch with her…</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Call the office. I’ll give you her number.
She’s something. I always said it as a compliment, but she’s a lot of
pussy to handle. Excuse my language. What do you want to eat?</p>
<p><strong>254 angle - waiters - later 254</strong>: are bringing the
main course to the table. Arthur is guzzling wine as he talks. Peter is
bored silly.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: … But the best is just a few weeks ago, one
of these jackass pilots, he lands long and the plane goes off the
runway. I was there. I was on the plane. We’re going into Mecca, see.
And the plane is full of Arabs and all these animals – sheep, goats,
chickens. They won’t travel without their animals. We had to put plastic
in the cabins. You know, they urinate, they defecate…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Anyway, the plane goes off the runway and we
hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the
sand and the plane skids around in a circle! 360 degrees before we stop!
We’re scared shitless. Panic. And we look into the cabin and there’s
everybody calm, quiet, they’re picking up their luggage and their
animals and they’re looking out the window at the little fire that
started on the wing and they’re waiting for the doors to open like
nothing happened. And then it dawns on me. They think this is
normal!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: They think this is the way you stop an
airplane.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: You stick one wing in the sand and you spin
around until you stop. What do they know? They never rode in an
airplane. They think this is how you do it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Arthur? Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me. Waiter!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mr. Ruskin seems to have suffered some kind
of – well, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think you’d better call someone.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Freddy? Attention, s’il vous plait!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is he choking? Let me give him the Heimlich
maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Excuse me, Monsieur Roberts. You are not
a doctor. And there are legal complications.</p>
<p><strong>mr. roberts</strong>: Yes, I see, but…</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: For your own protection and mine and my
restaurant, we leave Monsieur Ruskin in the hands of God and we go back
to our escargots.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well, somebody has to do something.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: We have called the police. An ambulance
is coming. There is nothing more we can do. Would you like some coffee
or dessert?</p>
<p><strong>mr. roberts</strong>: Gee, buddy. I think he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Eh, voila.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: L’addition, s’il vous plait.</p>

not accept credit cards.</p>

<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Ruskin?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to
offer my sympathy.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: How very kind. Did you know Arthur?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to
him when he died.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’ve reprobated myself over and over again
for being away…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>258 ext. terminal - maria and peter - dusk 258</strong>: move
toward Maria’s waiting limousine.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well, thank you for the kind words. I must go
now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. Just one other thing. I understand
you’re a friend of Sherman McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m sorry…?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. I gather you were not only in the car
with him when he had his unfortunate accident in the Bronx. But I
understand you were driving.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman would never tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I was hoping you might tell me exactly what
happened that night.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Look, Mr…. Mr….</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fallow.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: … Peckerhead. I am here for my husband’s
funeral. Understand? Now go away. Disappear. Disintegrate.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What kind of muckracking yellow journalist are
you!? You print a story like this without so much as a by-your-leave to
me or to Reverend Bacon here! Who the hell do you think you are.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Please, you have to keep your voices
down.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, don’t you understand? It is very
possible that Sherman McCoy was not driving that car. And I can almost
prove it.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: So what?! So what?! So what?! This is our
case.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Right here. You see? It’s the hospital that’s
the guilty party.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The hospital?! What are you talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A young man comes in here with a cerebral
concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist. That is our case! That
is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital. That is
what we have been working toward all this time. And you are confusing
the issue! Do you understand me?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is
a great story. This is my exclusive. And it’s also the truth!</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: It’s a little late for you to start telling
the truth, isn’t it, Pete?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t just drop this now. I can’t just let
it go.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Sure you can. There’s gonna be other stories,
other exclusives. Don’t worry. We’ll take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: That’s right. You’re our boy, Peter. You take
care of us and we’ll take care of you. I promise you, that’s going to be
a very profitable relationship for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Annie, I know that nothing can heal the wound
that you have suffered. But ten million dollars in damages will
certainly make your grief more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, yes, I could use a few things,
Reverend, thank you. I been worried about my clothes for instance. I
feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed. As
a model to black mothers everywhere, I think I should have the right
wardrobe. So if you could have Mr. Fox’s limousine pick me up in the
morning, I could do some shopping.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why certainly.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’ll need some furniture, too. And a new
refrigerator. And although I should probably continue to live in that
shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, I
would like to start looking now for a co-op in Manhattan – for me and my
son – something with a view of the river and preferably in a
neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How could I turn my back on the plight of
this grief stricken woman? How could I turn my back on a ‘profitable
relationship’? I was touched to the depths of what was left of my soul…
and my bank account.</p>
<p><strong>260a omitted 260a</strong>: thru thru</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So I printed their little story. Well, why
not? Why not be the best whore in the house? And anyway, I was beginning
to see even greater possibilities in my situation.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Now they’re going to sue the hospital. You
see? All they want is money. Imagine using a terrible tragedy like this
for your own selfish motives.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, sir. It is terrible.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Shut up, you asshole.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: What’s happening to my case? The People
versus Sherman McCoy? Where is my issue? Where is my cause? Where is my
hope?</p>
<p><strong>andriutti</strong>: I think we better talk to this
Mrs. Ruskin.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: You go to the press. You tell them we’re
going to question the woman, and if she is the woman who was in the car,
she faces possible charges, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p><strong>andriutti</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: And you, Mr. Wise-Guy-Know-It-All- Shitface,
you’re the one got us into this, you’re going to get us out. You go to
this broad, you tell her she’s in a whole lot of trouble, lay it on.
But, but, but – if she is willing to cooperate, if she will say what we
want her to say, then we will grant her immunity.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: Go on, go. What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Well today is her husband’s funeral.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: I don’t care if today is her mother’s bar
mitzvah, you go talk to her!!!</p>

wiring in this building.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: In less than three minutes, I had what I was
looking for. It was more than a story. I had the makings of a book here.
A great book. A prize winning effort. All I needed was a big finish.</p>

say?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: That’s us! That’s me! That’s Maria! How did
you get this?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Shhh! Listen.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I suppose we could still go to the police.
We could get a very talented lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And put our heads right into the horse’s
mouth? I’m the one who was driving the car. Don’t you think I’m the one
who should make the decision? And I say, no. No, Sherman. Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You mean the apartment was wired – bugged –
all that time?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Yeah. I checked it all out. Whoever sent me
this tape is either a big fan of yours or a not so big fan of Maria
Ruskin.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Then we have this as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: No. It’s an illegal tape. Totally illegal.
The guy who did this could go to jail for this. Now if this were your
tape, it would be legal. But it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What do you mean, ‘my tape’?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: Well, if you were wired and you recorded
your own conversation that would be okay. But there is no way that this
tape can be used as evidence in a court of law.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Then what good is it?</p>
<p><strong>killian</strong>: It gave me an idea.</p>

in black enters and walks down the aisle. People stop her and offer
condolences.</p>

<p><strong>269d angle - sherman 269d</strong>: wearing dark glasses and
a raincoat, hiding near a door- way that leads into an adjacent “family
room.” As Maria passes, he signals her. FOLLOW Maria INTO:</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman! Whatever are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I’m sorry, Maria. I have to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You seem to be doing all your talking to the
newspapers these days.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Believe me, I had nothing to do with that.
We didn’t want your name in the papers any more than you did.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I see. Well, here we are, Sherman. The couple
that all New York is talking about. And we’re not even a couple
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I thought you’d run out on me. I didn’t
even know where you went. And I was left sort of holding the bag, trying
to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman. Would I do that to you? Sherman,
Sherman, Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What are we going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You have to help me, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: But how can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Well, I know this may sound like a strange
request, but you could start by telling the police what really
happened.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest thing. But
I’m not sure anybody knows what really happened. Not anymore. And if
anybody does know, it certainly isn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: But you were driving the car that
night.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Was I? I don’t remember. Isn’t it funny how a
little thing like that can slip your mind? God, there’s something about
funerals that is so stimulating. My panties have been wet all
morning.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, please…</p>
<p><strong>270 int. viewing room - director 270</strong>: is still at
the microphone.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: And now, in accordance with the wishes of
Mr. Ruskin…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: … Manny Leerman will play a medley of
Arthur’s favorite songs.</p>
<p><strong>273 angle - kramer 273</strong>: leaving the viewing
room.</p>
<p><strong>274 int. hallway - kramer - day 274</strong>: looking from
room to room.</p>
<p><strong>275 int. crypts - maria - day 275</strong>: is trying to
embrace Sherman. He remains “hunched” over, trying to stay away from her
and keep her hands off his back.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman. What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Then why are you all hunched over?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, we have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman, what’s this on your back?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: This lump, this piece of metal, this thing on
your back?!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t know – my belt, belt buckle.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You don’t have a belt buckle in the back.
There’s some sort of subterfuge afoot here. Isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You are secreting something on your body!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I want to see what it is.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, are you crazy!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And a wire! A wire!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Eeeooowww!!!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You rotten, dishonest bastard!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, I didn’t want to do this, but you
gave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Mrs. Ruskin.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Go away whoever you are!</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: This is Jed Kramer. From the district
attorney’s office.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: My, my, my, Mr. McCoy. I’d say your goose was
just about home- fried.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I have protected you, Maria. I have been a
gentleman. I have done my best to keep your name out of this. But you
have got to help me. You have got to do the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Never. Never. Never. I hope you die and hang
in the electric chair!</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: … I’m with the District Attorney’s office. I
wonder if I might have a few words…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He just ran out that back door.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Who?!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sherman McCoy!</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m sorry if I alarmed you. But he was acting
very strange. My name is Maria Ruskin.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Kramer, Jed Kramer, Jed. I’m the Assistant
District Attorney for Bronx County.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh. I see. And what a handsome District
Attorney you are, too.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I’m not the… uh… I’m the Assistant D.A.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Well, you and I have a lot to talk about.
Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, we do.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes. Because if I’m going to testify I’m
going to want to know exactly what I should… and should not say.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>278 int. sherman’s apartment - sherman - night 278</strong>:
is sitting alone in the empty apartment. Almost every- thing is gone –
furniture, rugs, paintings. Sherman has a tape recorder in front of him.
In his hand he holds two tapes. There is a KNOCK at the door.</p>
<p><strong>279 continued: 279</strong>: MR. McCOY</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I usually come in the back way now.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Sure. Sorry. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Judy… uh…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. She moves quickly.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: She has a good lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: No. Of course not. Jesus. Or this apartment
for that matter. For what it cost, for what you paid for it. Or the
furniture…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Or my car, or my work, or my clothes, my
life, my money… For Christ’s sake, you didn’t come here now, you didn’t
come all the way here on a fucking subway probably to tell me now…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I mean, I’m not going to get, at this late
date, I’m not going to get the ethics and morality speech, not now, when
I have to do what I’m going to do in that courtroom tomorrow, if that’s
what you’ve come to give me, Jesus… No. No. I’m sorry. I came here to… I
don’t know how to do this. You didn’t call. We wanted to help. I came
here to tell you that we are here for you. That you are our son and that
we love you. ‘We.’ I don’t mean we. I mean I. That I love you. That’s
all. Please. Well. What you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: There’s only one thing I can do. I want to
see the truth come out and burn every one of them. And there’s only one
way to do that.</p>
<p><strong>280 continued: 280</strong>: MR. McCOY</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Lie.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes? And yet, if the truth won’t set you
free, yes. Why not? Lie.</p>
<p><strong>281 int. courtroom - judge white - day 281</strong>: is
banging his gavel, trying to silence the overflowing courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>282 angle - statue of blind justice 282</strong>: Some
demonstrators are climbing on the statue to get a better view.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: … And this incident occurred on the ramp to
the expressway or on the avenue itself.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Why, on the avenue. Right on the street.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: And was there any obstruction or barricade
of any kind that caused the car to stop?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, no. Nothing like that at all.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Finally, one last question. Can you tell us,
Mrs. Ruskin, who was driving the car when Henry Lamb was hit?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Why, Sherman never let anyone drive his
car.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Sherman McCoy was driving the car.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>284 various angles - everyone 284</strong>: Sherman and
Killian at the defense table. In the audience, Bacon, Fox, Gerald Moore,
Weiss and finally Peter Fallow taking notes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And there it was. The end of Sherman McCoy.
And it wasn’t the ending I was hoping for. He was finished. She might as
well have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. There was no
hope now. The darkness closed in around him. And then I noticed the most
peculiar thing. Sherman was smiling.</p>
<p><strong>285 angle to include sherman 285</strong>: smiling.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: … and I wanted to report the incident but he
wouldn’t let me. He said he was driving and it was his decision to
make.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: You were surprised?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I was shocked. There are certain qualities of
virtue that I admire in a human being, virtues that I hope I possess
myself…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We have time for a quickie. What do you say,
Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I don’t feel terrifically sexy at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: What in hell…?!</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You know I’m a sucker for a soft dick.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Maria, you are incorrigible.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I supppose, we could still go to the
police. We could get a very talented lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And put our heads right into the tiger’s
mouth? I’m the one who was driving the car. Don’t you think I’m the one
who should make that decision.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Whose tape is this, Mr. McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: That tape is mine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: If Your Honor please…</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Shut up, Mr. Kramer. Mr. McCoy, I
remind you that you are still under oath. Now, did you record this
conversation?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh, yes, sir, I did. I recorded this
conversation on this tape. My tape. This is my tape of my conversation.
I recorded it. Yes, sir. Yes, sir, three bags full.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Get out of my face. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: I want some fucking order in here!</p>
<p><strong>286 continued: 286</strong>: He bangs the gavel until the
noise subsides.</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: So you insist on testing the will of
this court!!!! Now you shut up and sit down!! All of you! Very well. In
the case of the People versus Sherman McCoy, the Grand Jury has returned
an indictment. Based on the evidence contained in this recording… … and
pursuant to my authority to supervise the Grand Jury’s proceedings…</p>
<p><strong>demonstrators</strong>: Whitewash!! Whitewash!!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: … I am ordering the indictment
dismissed in the interests of justice, without prejudice and with leave
to re-present by the District Attorney.</p>
<p><strong>288 angle - white 288</strong>: rises on the bench like an
eagle. He pounds the gavel repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>demonstrators</strong>: Justice. We want justice!!! We want
justice!!!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: Justice! You want justice?! I’ll give
you justice!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You racist pig!</p>
<p><strong>judge white</strong>: You dare call me a racist! Well, I say
to you, you – a mob who dares to come into these walls – I say to you,
what does it matter … the color of a man’s skin? If witnesses perjure
themselves… and a prosecutor, a sworn officer of the court, enlists the
perjurers … and a district attorney throws a man to the mob and lawyers
carve up that man for his money… and men of the cloth, men of God take
the prime cuts! Now you tell me –</p>
<p><strong>is that justice?!</strong>: Silence.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I don’t hear you!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’ll tell you what justice is not. Justice is
not the will of the few and it’s not the will of the many. Justice is
not politics. Justice is the law. And the law is man’s feeble attempt to
set down the principles of decency. Decency! And decency is not a deal.
Or an angle, or a contract, or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a
bid for sympathy. Decency is not the beast that bays for money, power,
dominion, position, votes and blood! Decency is what your mother taught
you! Decency is in your bones! Do I make myself clear! Now go home. Go
home now. Be decent people. Be decent.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’re free to go, Mr. McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>289 angle - courtroom 289</strong>: as another blood-curdling
roar goes up from the crazed mob. They close in on the Judge and
Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: You bald-headed Uncle Tom pussy!! Are you
going to take this Park Avenue justice!? Are you?</p>
<p><strong>292a int. corridor - sherman and judge 292a</strong>: come
out of the courtroom, pursued by the spectators. They are pressed
against a huge statue of “blind justice” at the end of the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>292c angle - statue 292c</strong>: teeters.</p>
<p><strong>292d angle - kramer 292d</strong>: in the mob, pressing
toward Sherman and the Judge.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: We’re not finished with you, McCoy. You’ll
be back in this courtroom. This decision will be appealed until I see
you behind bars! You hear me, Judge.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Get your fucking face out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: This fucking face is going to see you
shining shoes in Grand Central Station.</p>
<p><strong>293 omitted 293</strong>: &amp; &amp; 294 294</p>
<p><strong>295 angle - statue 295</strong>: falls. People scream and
scatter. The statue shatters as it hits the floor. The bronze sword
slides across the floor and comes to rest at Sherman’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: This fucking face is going to see you
selling pencils, you black son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>296 continued: 296</strong>: Sherman whacks Kramer with the
sword. Kramer falls away. Sherman helps the Judge down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>296a angle - bacon and fox 296a</strong>: coming out of the
courtroom, intercepting Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>bacon</strong>: Sherman McCoy! You shall not escape. You
shall live in fear on this island, in the mighty sea of people, for the
people – and justice – are waiting for you!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You’ve been woefully misrepresented here,
Mr. McCoy. I think you should give me a call…</p>
<p><strong>296b angle - weiss 296b</strong>: giving an interview for a
TV news team.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: … and I promise you and the people of this
city that Henry Lamb will not be forgotten. Henry Lamb will live, like
the Alamo, as a symbol of slaughtered innocence.</p>
<p><strong>weiss</strong>: And this man’s name will live in infamy. Like
Adolf Hitler! Like Son of Sam! Like Idi Amin! John Wilkes Booth! Ted
Bundy! Jesse Helms!</p>
<p><strong>297a angle - fallow 297a</strong>: approaches Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>fallow</strong>: Sherman! Sherman! Congratulations. This is
going to make one hell of a story!!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You again! Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, sorry. I’m Peter Fallow. I’m Peter
Fallow. Ha. Ha. Ha.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks. I needed that.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’m alright. Damn hooligans.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: And you. You, too. You go home now. And be
decent. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I hear you, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>299 angle - peter fallow 299</strong>: through the iron
gates.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It was the last I saw of Sherman McCoy…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And so we come to the end of our story.
Sherman, you see, who started with so much, lost everything. But he
gained his soul. Whereas I, you see, who started with so little, gained
everything…</p>
<p><strong>301 omitted 301</strong>: thru thru 303 303</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the
National Book Award and just about every other prize you can win, ladies
and gentlemen, Mr. Peter Fallow!!</p>
<p><strong>304 angle - peter 304</strong>: As he rises unsteadily to his
feet the room goes wild with applause. Peter waves and makes his way
toward the podium.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But what does it profit a man if he gains the
whole world and loses … Ah, well. There are compensations.</p>
<p><strong>306 int. hospital room - henry lamb - night 306</strong>:
lying in his bed. Perfectly still. And then his nose twitches. His hand
comes up and scratches his nose. His eyes open. He sits up, looks
around, figures where he is. He gets out of bed, disconnects the
I.V.</p>
<p><strong>307 ext. hospital - henry lamb 307</strong>: comes out of
hospital, he smiles and walks away down the street.</p>
