<p><strong>e.) channel 7</strong>: has been changed to CHANNEL 8</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: Mister Foreman, have you arrived at a
verdict?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We have, your honor. We find the defendant
guilty of all the charges.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Your honor, may I approach the bench?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What’s going on? “Guilty”! What is this?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I got your bail continued.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bail, for Chrissake! I’m innocent!</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: Mister LaPlante, I have been persuaded
in view of your continued employment and your lack of prior convictions,
to continue your bail under the same conditions heretofore, pending
sentencing six days from now. In the meantime you will make an
appointment with the probation officer who will make a recommendation to
me regarding your sentence. I urge you to use these six days to set your
personal affairs in order in anticipation of incarceration.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: “Anticipation of incarceration”?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I know what he means. I’m not a prison kinda
guy, Miss O’Day. I’m a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I
“augment” my income a little with some “business deals,” maybe summa the
guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I’m not an investigator.
You can’t make it on a wage no more, not in this country.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I think our best course right now would be to
focus on the Probation Officer’s report…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He gives a good report and I walk?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: We can hope. You still have your job,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I
got the flu.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Are you pretty involved in his
upbringing?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn
paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can’t afford a lawyer? You
know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh,
more experienced…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I understand. How often do you see your
son?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Often, uh.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: How recently?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: It’s November.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: She don’t like me to see him. Says I’m a bad
influence.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I think you should visit your son. And try
and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You
need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with
familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Uh, I know you’re having financial
difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if… I mean, the money I
loaned you…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Some of it. Right here. I got some of it.
I’ll get the rest as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I know things are difficult for you, Mister
LaPlante. I don’t want to take your last dime…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Right. I better keep some if I’m gonna see
the kid. For gas and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Wow! Look at that one!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: If you were in there, he’d kill you, wouldn’t
he…Dad?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, yeah, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This guy, this “friend” your mother’s
seeing, he’s a fireman, huh? He ever… spend the night, whatsisname?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Sometimes. His name’s Elliot. He saved a guy’s
life one time. In a fire.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh yeah? A hero, huh? Was he in the ’Nam,
this guy Elliot?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: “The Nomm”? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Were you in it? In the war?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You never saw that picture, huh?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What picture?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Me in my uniform. Used to be on the
bookcase.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Whatcha gotta do there, buddy, is ya gotta
get in close so ya don’t piss on yer shoes. It don’t matter <u>now</u>
cause you’re wearin’ them sneakers but the time’s gonna come when you’re
gonna be wearin’ good shoes, expensive ones, and you don’t wanna piss on
them, you wanna protect ’em. From piss, from tough guys, from
everything.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What I don’t like about public restrooms is
how you’re always standing in piss. It don’t matter to you, you got
those sneakers but I’m standing in piss in very expensive shoes. It’s a
breakdown in custodial services.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Are you gonna take me somewhere next
weekend?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m working on that. It’s just I got some
business problems and… whatsa matter?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Somebody lost a wallet.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You give it to the manager, he pockets the
dough, throws the wallet away. Most people who work in supervisory
positions… I’m not saying all… are crooks.</p>
<p><strong>bag laoy</strong>: Excuse me, sir, could you spare…?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: No way, lady, not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You gotta resist the urge to be nice to
those people, they’re con artists, they take advantage of the soft
heart. A lot of ’em are financially better off than the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What I’m gonna do on this wallet thing is,
Monday, day after tomorrow, I’m gonna have my secretary phone this guy
up from the name on his driver’s license Let the guy come and get his
wallet and make sure you get a reward. You deserve a reward. You want
one, doncha? A reward? Gwan, get in.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Whatcha gotta do, you gotta look out for
number one. It sounds harsh, but it’s a goddamn jungle out there, kid.
That’s why you gotta keep a low profile! Right? A low profile! It’s
where you don’t give nobody nothin’ to shoot at, stay outta sight, be
parta the woodwork, don’t ever tell ’em your name, they’ll use it
against you.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Here. Get off here.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Thanks. Thanks, pal.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Listen, buddy, I’m really enjoying this
relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you
better. Thing is, I got all this business stuff…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I could go to a movie Thursday night. ’Cause
we don’t have school on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Here we are. Yeah, that’s a possibility. A
movie. Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time. Point
that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that. She’s
still like that, right?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah. I’ll see ya… dad.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Bernie! Where ya been, Pal?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Some guys been looking for me, Chick?
Spanish kinda guys.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Spanish kinda guys!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven,
willya?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: What is it, five days now I don’t see
you!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: ’Cause I’m up to my ass in shit is why. I’m
broke, plus I got legal problems… Nobody was asking for me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Nope. Legal problems, you gotta have a good
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: My attorney, she’s just outta law school,
about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You gotta kid? How old’s your kid?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice
kid.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I can’t afford no better. My ex, she
attached my pay check for child support payments. You looking for Bernie
LaPlante by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I didn’t even know you had a kid.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The thing about kids is, they’re so… young!
They don’t know nothin’ yet. When you’re a kid, you think you’re gonna
grow up an’ be a “wonderful person” instead of an asshole, like
everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: We’re all assholes, Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be
this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.</p>
<p><strong>espinosa’s voice</strong>: You Bernie Planta?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: LaPlante. Bernie LaPlante. You the guys
Bunny called, huh?</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: Three hours is old, man. Very old.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, he might not of reported ’em at all
yet. He might not know for a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>vargas</strong>: You pick his pocket?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, more or less. Trust me, these are very
very fresh.</p>
<p><strong>broadman</strong>: To be honest, I can’t make sense of it
either, Ms. Gayley. Things seem to be on the upswing, our differences
with the SEC have been favorably resolved. In a business sense, I
believe we’ve “turned the corner…”</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Mister Broadman, your wife and children are on
their way here as we speak. Don’t you think – ?</p>
<p><strong>broadman</strong>: I feel I’ve done very well in life: good
health, wonderful family, much wealth. I guess what we’re talking about
here is a kind of despair. I just have the feeling that everything from
here on is going to be… downhill… At a time like this, I think I’m
entitled, as the saying goes, to “look out for number one” and put my
own needs first. That pretty much concludes what I have to say. Thanks
for coming out here to let me talk to you and your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Oh my god! Chucky, tilt down.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Did you get it? Jesus, did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Yeah, I got it. Sports training. You learn
to follow the ball. How about you do a wrap-up from up here? I’ll pan
off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Suicide number 137 of this year in this city
was neither a destitute nor a lonely man, but a successful executive
with a loving family and forty million dollars in the bank. If there’s
nameless “despair” in executive offices, what can there be sixty stories
below where the hungry and the homeless, the brutalized and the
addicted, fight their daily battle for survival. From a ledge sixty
stories above the street, I’m Gale Gayley for Channel Four News.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Whadja think of the fall shot, Chief? The
guy drops twenty stories in perfect focus, center frame while I go
smoothly from F16 to F5.6.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Helluva shot, Chucky, beautiful. Parker,
run this down to Frazier, tell him we open with it at six, eleven and at
seven a.m….</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Hi, Chief. You like the suicide?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Never reach out!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Hello, Mister Wallace.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: He’s right. It’s unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: If you reach out, you could get pulled over
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What’re we talking about? Reach out for
what?</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: I told them how you were upset we didn’t
save the guy…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Saving people is not our job. It’s as wrong
to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You wouldn’t push the guy, would you?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I didn’t say I thought we should have saved
him..</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: You didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I said I wished it had at least occurred to me
to consider saving him.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What good would that do?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It would make me feel like a human being
instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman. Besides it wouldn’t be a bad
story, would it, “Newswoman Saves Suicide?”</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You just can’t bear the idea of good news.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: You’re sitting on your ticket.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Ticket! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: She’s flying to New York. She’s been
nominated for a Silver Mike…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: A Silver Mike! You’re covering us in
glory!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I haven’t won it yet. I notice you’ve got me
scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: An hour after…! Deak, for Heaven’s sake!
Let’s give her a night in New York City. We’ll put her and her boyfriend
up at a good hotel…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: She broke up with her boyfriend. Listen,
babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human
interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded
heart of the heartless metropolis.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: The story behind the story, the ugly scandal
behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: That too.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Would the station put me up at a good
hotel…?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Absolutely!</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Okay, hell with it. Party hearty… is that
what they say? I’ll figure something out. She’s just pretending she’s a
person. She’s really a reporter. Fifty bucks she’s on the first flight
back.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: You know what I don’t get? I don’t get why a
guy who’s gonna jump asks to talk to a TV reporter?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Cause how’s he gonna know he’s jumped if
it’s not on the six o’clock news.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey! Do I have a record? Have I ever done
time? I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn’t? Parking tickets
for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff! Have I ever been convicted of
anything?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mister LaPlante…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Take a look at my employment record, you got
my employment record there, right? You see any unemployment there, any
welfare? I’m a taxpayer. They eat me alive, the tax people, they got
taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms! Taxes and forms so
I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff,
guys like me pay your wages…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mister LaPlante…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Do I hit anybody? You see me shoot anybody?
Hey, drugs! Do I sell drugs? Jesus, I don’t belong in prison. I’m a
family man.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Mister LaPlante…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Look, I got this kid. We got a goddamn
relationship! I’m takin’ him to a movie tonight! He worships me. If I go
down what’s this do to my son? I’m his goddamn role model for Christ
sake!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Listen, if I coulda afforded an experienced
attorney, I woulda walked. It was a shitty case, very circumstantial.
You gonna send me downstate for having an inexperienced lawyer? How you
gonna feel about the system if you do that?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Thank you, very much. I’m grateful for this.
Since you’re all colleagues here, you know what kind of a team it takes…
to put a story on a screen. I don’t have to explain to you how much the
cameraman, the editor, the assignment editor and the news director, to
mention a few did to get me this award.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: This is an onion. It’s a metaphor for a news
story. Only a few hours ago I was standing on a ledge sixty stories
above a street interviewing a man who subsequently jumped to his death.
Forty million dollars in the bank, happily married, good health.
<u>Great</u> <u>story</u>!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: There’s gotta be more. We’re pros, right? Some
kinda extramarital hanky panky, maybe? Another good story! Maybe the
guy’s been accused of child molesting. Terrific story! Then it turns out
the accusation was false. Wonderful! More story.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Maybe the alleged mistress was lying, setting
the guy up. Sensational story! We keep going, keep digging, keep
investigating. We expose the guy’s whole life, his family. Why? Because
we’re pros! Because… <u>we’re</u> <u>looking</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u>
<u>truth!</u></p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: But what if, after all our digging, after all
our painstaking investigation, what if <u>it</u> <u>turns</u> <u>out</u>
<u>there</u> <u>wasn’t</u> <u>any</u> <u>truth?</u> Just stories! One
story after another, one layer, then another layer, until there’s
nothing left. And if it’s like that, do we have any. obligation to stop
at any point? Or do we just keep going, digging, digging, digging,
peeling, peeling, peeling, until we’ve peeled it all away, until we’ve
destroyed what we were investigating in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I’ll bet all of you, like me, yearn for just
one story that isn’t about uncovering layer after layer of human
weakness; a story that reveals with each new layer of investigation,
something finer and nobler, something even… inspirational.</p>
<p><strong>bag lady/tv</strong>: First rule out here on the streets is
you gotta watch out for number one. If you go down… break a bone or
something… you’re gone! Nobody’s gonna pick you up.’</p>
<p><strong>winston’s voice</strong>: Shitty color! Looka the skin
tones.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Chrissake! Homeless people are supposed to
have shitty skin tones. Look!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: There you go! Skin tones! Listen, you gotta
fish or cut bait. I wouldn’t even do this if I didn’t have these legal
problems. Two fifty. That’s it. I gotta get outta here, I gotta take my
kid to the movies tonight, I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I’ll go two hundred.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Two hundred! How about a jacket? Wanna buy
me a jacket?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It’s very nice actually. “For Excellence in
the Pursuit of Truth.” Uh, listen, I just wanted you to know I got a
seat back on the early flight after all so… What?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What do you mean you gave it to Conklin?
Conklin wasn’t on that ledge! Conklin wasn’t…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Gale, you were gonna do the town, remember?
Fancy suite at the station’s expense, see a show, get laid maybe. What
was I supposed to do?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Okay, okay, you get back tonight, doll, and
I’ll take Conklin off your suicide. Fly carefully… and congratulations
on the award.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What’d I tell ya! They’re all like that,
the good ones. They’re junkies for the story. They can’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Thank you. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There’s another credit card on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I know why it’s raining. I coulda predicted
this. It’s raining because my wipers are fucked up. If my wipers were
okay, the fucking sun would be shining right now. At night!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>p.a. system</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your
Captain. We’re experiencing a high reading on one of our indicators. Ten
to one, it’s a malfunction in a gauge, but just as a precaution I’m
going to ask you to fasten your seat belts while the Flight Attendants
run through some safety procedures with you. I apologize for the
necessity and the inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: First make sure your seat belts are fastened
securely. Then brace your arms against the seat ahead at you like this.
You can use pillows or blankets…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Mommy, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Everything’s going to be fine, honey.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: – when you reach the bottom of the chute you
should immediately move as far away from the plane as possible in the
event of a fire on the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Those of you who can should help others who
may be unable to move quickly.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m late already! Don’t quit on me now, for
Chrissake! This ain’t the time!</p>

<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Please, everybody, one at a time. Please,

<p><strong>richie</strong>: Please, Miss, my father can’t move. He can’t

<p><strong>leslie</strong>: Sir, you can’t go back in. Sir, you’re

I…OW!</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Lady, you’re not okay.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Miss, please, you’ve got a broken
arm.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It’s my leg. My leg hurts… CHUCKY! OVER HERE,
CHUCKY! CHUCKY!</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: Holy shit! It’s Gayley!</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: Gayley! You were on the plane?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: This is my story, Conk. I did the
research.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Please, she’s injured, she’s gotta go to
the hospital…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Get the Flight Attendant, the one who manned
the door. Also some guy, a passenger, pulled me out. Talk to him. Then
get down to the hospital and I’ll do an interview and an intro and
close. Make sure…</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: She’s a real piece of work! Unbelievable!
“It’s ’my story, I did the research.”</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: You’re not going to believe the shot I got
back there. Major Awards!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Christ! My car! Where’s my car?</p>
<p><strong>state police officer</strong>: Where are you hurt, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Huh? Hurt? What?</p>
<p><strong>state police officer</strong>: How about coming over to the
ambulance, sir, let the medical people check you out.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, I don’t need no ambulance. I’m just
looking for my car… It musta burned up or something.</p>
<p><strong>state police officer</strong>: You weren’t in your car, sir,
you were in an airplane crash. But everything’s going to be okay, we’ll
just go see the doctor and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. brown</strong>: Please, please, my husband’s been
waiting for medical attention…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This shit has gotta be great for the paint
job!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He waited for you three hours!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!
Absolutely fantastic! I’m on my way –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Ev, it’s not my fault! I’m trying to tell
you this incredible –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!
You screwed up my life, now you’re gonna screw up Joey’s life, but
you’re never gonna accept responsibility for anyth–</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Is he here, your friend. The fireman?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He had an emergency call… a <u>real</u>
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Why doncha let me in so we don’t wake
everybody in the neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I’m trying
to tell you what happened. What happened is…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The same thing that always happens! You blew
it! And this time you broke your son’s heart instead of mine! He was so
proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father… and you let
him down! Like you let everybody down, always! What did you do, take a
mudbath?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to… to… okay,
nevermind. Just lemme talk to Joey to… to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He’s in bed! You’re not gonna wake him and
make him crazy, do you understand? He comes home from the zoo, he wants
to know if Elliot’s a “war hero” like you… he wants to know how many
people you killed…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: “Elliot”? The heroic goddamn fireman?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I had to explain your tendancy to
“exaggerate”, How you were actually “in country” all of two weeks and
how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your
outfit, no more, no less…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Three weeks, Ev. I didn’t tell him I killed
anybody…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Maybe not,… but you let him believe it! And
then I gotta explain about the homeless…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The homeless!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: How not all of them own apartment complexes,
how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent
babies when they’re panhandling. He’s ten years old, Bernie!
Impressionable!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Listen, it’s important, Ev, I gotta see him,
I got my reasons, very goddamn important…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow,
he’d like to hear from you. Where’s your other shoe? Never mind! I don’t
want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I was giving him some advice is all.
Preparing him for life. You don’t want him to grow up soft, Ev , it’s
tough out there, it’s a goddamn jungle.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Back to the jungle, Bernie. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Sorry, Ev, to bother you again. This is for
Joey, his reward… for this wallet he found. When I, uh , returned it I
told the guy he hadda give my kid something for finding it, for the
honesty. So the kid would learn how honestly pays.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Just give it to him, okay, Ev?</p>
<p><strong>bubber’s voice</strong>: You actually went into it? A burning
airplane?</p>
<p><strong>bernie’s voice</strong>: “Into it”! “Into it”, for Chrissake!
I was practically living in the goddamn thing… every time I turned
around, some other person wants me to save ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Couldn’t see a fucking foot in front of me,
smoke… then booooom! It explodes! I could be dead!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: And you pulled people out? You’re… a
hero.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nah, I fucked it up. I was tryin’ to impress
this kid, don’t ask me why. I was gonna rescue his old man, but I
couldn’t find the poor bastard. He musta blew up. I got the hell outta
there. I didn’t have the nerve to face the kid.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: A lotta people wouldn’t have tried. It was
pretty brave even trying…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Try stupid.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Sorry about that. Just toss them in back. A
lot of people would say that’s what heroism is… stupidity. Doing
something that if you thought about it, you wouldn’t do it, it’s not in
your… interest.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You got a drinking problem or what?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I sell them at the recycling center. Gives
me a little for gas and food.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Looks like you live in here, for
Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: In bad weather, yeah. Mostly I camp out in
the woods. I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked
you up.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Down on my luck! Hey, I toldja, a goddamn
plane fell on me outta the sky. In America, for Chrissake! See this
shoe! Hundred dollar pair of shoes. One shoe!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You should give it to someone with only one
leg.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: One leg! Like the Red Cross or
something?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I know a guy who only has one leg.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Sell it to him. You get a couple bucks, it
pays for the ride. I got a job, nice apartment. I do okay.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: They interview you or anything? At the plane
crash?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, do I look crazy? I don’t go for that
shit… interviews, media. They’re manipulators. “Keep a low profile,”
that’s my motto.</p>
<p><strong>bernie’s voice</strong>: Besides, I got these legal problems.
My attorney don’t want me giving statements to the press.</p>
<p><strong>gale.</strong>: I don’t understand. You can’t <u>find</u>
him?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: There’s a lot of confusion around what went
on last night, it’s not clear…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You said all the passengers were accounted
for…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Apparently the guy who pulled you out
wasn’t a passenger…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: A paramedic? A fireman? He didn’t have a
uniform…</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: From what we could get, there’s a kind of…
sort of… “mystery guy”… involved.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: We’re piecing together different accounts
and…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: A “mystery guy!” “Not a passenger.” Who?</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: We don’t know who he is, he…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: He disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: A non-passenger, non-rescue-worker went into a
burning plane and pulled me out and… <u>disappeared</u>?</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: Not just you. Apparently this guy is the
one who opened the emergency exit from the outside…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Everybody! He saved everybody on the plane!
Because of him, no fatalities! I don’t think you’re supposed to move
around like that, Gale. You’re attached there…</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: And all of a sudden, this… “civilian”…
rushed <u>into</u> the plane. Next thing you know he’s hauling Freddy…
he’s the other flight attendant… out and then <u>he</u> <u>goes back
in</u>. That’s what gave me the courage to hang in there even though I
knew the plane could blow any minute…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: It was just this face, all dirty, it just
appeared. I really thought I was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Did he say anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: He… asked if I was “Fletcher.”</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: ONE WORD! ONE WORD, LAPLANTE, AND YOU’RE
FIRED! GOT THAT? ONE WORD!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bill, I…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: DON’T SAY “BILL,” BERNIE! DON’T SAY ONE
WORD! DIDN’T I SAY “ONE WORD AND YOU’RE FIRED?”</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT’LL BE AN
<u>EXCUSE</u>! IT’LL BE “BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE
HUNDRED AND SIX.” NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE. THAT’S HOW
MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I
HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bill, I got some legal problems and I…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: THAT’S IT! YOU TALKED! YOU’RE FIRED! OUTTA
HERE! GET OUTTA HERE!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bill, listen…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: OUT! I TOLDJA. JESUS CHRIST, I GOT
CUSTOMERS WAITING! AN’ YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT? AN’ MEET THE
PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bill, I got financial problems and…</p>
<p><strong>robinson</strong>: I DON’T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS,
I’M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU’RE</u> ONE A MY
PROBLEMS. GET OUT! OUT! OUT!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He was asking for Mr. Fletcher…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: My son and I got separated in the
confusion and smoke. The very courageous stewardess at the exit told me
my boy had got out so I got out too. But my son had already told this…
man that I was still in there.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: I thought my dad was still… still in there.
So I asked the man to save my father.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What did the man say, Richie?</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: He said… uh… he said… “I’ll save him.” He
said, “I’ll save your father.”</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Back. Go back. You missed it.</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Now. Go forward again.</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: There! Right there.</p>
<p><strong>man could do better… a tiny, anonymous figure, alone,
against</strong>: A GIGANTIC MOUNTAIN OF PURE FIRE. AND FROM NOW ON IT
WILL BE REFERRED TO AS “THE IMAGE.”</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: That’s him?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Who else? We’ve accounted for everyone else.
That’s our hero!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: I didn’t see the guy when I shot it. I
thought I was getting the last survivors when I panned over.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Any chance we could do some kind of
electronic enhancement, you think? Get a clear picture, identify
him?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: There’s no face really, nothing to work with.
Big dots, that’s all you’ll get.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Look at the guy! He just saved fifty people.
Now he’s going to disappear. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>richie/tv</strong>: He said… uh, he said… “I’ll save your
father.”</p>
<p><strong>leslie/tv</strong>: – all of a sudden, this… civilian… He
rushed <u>into</u> the plane.</p>
<p><strong>freddy/tv</strong>: I woke up in an ambulance. Leslie, the
other flight attendant, told me the guy dragged me to the exit.</p>
<p><strong>leslie/tv</strong>: “Here, give this guy a hand,” he said.
The next thing I knew, he was going back in there, into all that
smoke…</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith/tv</strong>: I was crawling around on the floor. I
thought I was a goner!</p>
<p><strong>young people, old people, rich people, poor people,
convicts,</strong>: DENTISTS, BLACK PEOPLE, BROWN PEOPLE, WHITE PEOPLE,
CHINESE PEOPLE are watching the report in…</p>
<p><strong>-home</strong>: -BARBERSHOP -ELECTRONICS SHOWROOM -JAIL CELL
-SKID ROW HOTEL LOBBY -SHADOW LOUNGE CHICK watching the report.
-CLASSROOM JOEY watching the report in a classroom. -EVELYN’S KITCHEN
EVELYN watching the report in her kitchen. -ALLEY BUBBER is listening to
the report on a radio in an alley.</p>
<p><strong>gale/tv</strong>: – out of the darkness… out of the smoke and
the fear… came a man with no name… no uniform… but an abundance of
courage.</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voiceover/tv</strong>: A man who was thinking not
about himself but about others, risking his own life for ours… He’s out
there now somewhere… and… whoever you are, I, and the other survivors of
Flight 104, say, “Thank you! God bless!”</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Not bad. But if you gotta wear a cast, you
oughtta feature it more it’s parta the story. Network’s taking
everything we give ’em. They wanta feed off our six o’clock whether we
find the mystery guy or not. We’re very big nationally.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: It’s a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love
it.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: We’re gonna feature Gale’s cast more. The
trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we
have Gale and there’s no mystery guy, we’re the center of the story. But
if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive…</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: What about a reward for coming forward?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: There could be problems with something like
that Mister Wallace. What if…?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>gale/voiceover/tv</strong>: A phone check with survivors has
confirmed that the shoe does not belong to any of the crew or passengers
of Flight 104. Several witnesses recall the mysterious man who saved
fifty-four people referring to his missing shoe. The conclusion; the
unknown hero, know to many as “The Angel of Flight 104,” wears a size
10B shoe.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn’s voice</strong>: Joey! Dinner! Now! Turn that thing
off.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: He lost a shoe!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Who lost a shoe? Wash your hands.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: The “unknown hero.” They found his shoe right
beside the plane crash.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Superman, you mean? Lost a shoe! What
next?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Elliot! The man saved hundreds of
people!</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: Fifty-four! I was there, remember? You know
why I didn’t rush into that plane? Because I’m a trained fireman, that’s
why! Part of a team! A disciplined team. We take risks all the time,
save people. But we don’t take crazy chances. This guy does something
really <u>dumb</u> and he lucks out. So the media go crazy about his
shoe for god’s sake! What kind of message are they giving to youth?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What kind of message are <u>you</u> giving
to youth? Sneering at someone for sticking his neck out. You sound like
my ex for heaven’s sake… Mister Cynicism.</p>
<p><strong>elliot</strong>: So what can I say? Give your ex credit for
being smart enough not to do something stupid. Maybe the man’s not all
bad. I’m gonna watch TV, hoping it’s not all this “Superman stuff.”</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: My father didn’t have his shoes on when he…
when he came here.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You were in bed. Weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: I… I saw him out the window.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You think your father would do something
like that? Rescue people? Your father is Bernie LaPlante, Joey. It’s
against his religion to stick his neck out.</p>
<p><strong>channel 4 anchorperson/tv</strong>: – where the leader of a
religious group claimed today that the mysterious hero is, in fact, an
angel who is anticipated in scripture.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Bernie, how’sa kid?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You don’t wanna know, Chick, you don’t wanna
know. Those guys been in here?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You in business with those guys or what? I
wouldn’t want a problem for the establishment, Bern.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You couldn’t have a problem, Chick, because
I personally have got them all. I cornered the whole goddamn market. You
wouldn’t believe… Oh, how ya doin’…?</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: We bring our frenn this time, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Excuse me here, Chick, I gotta do these guys
a little favor.</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: Hey, vato! Vamos.</p>

<p><strong>mendoza</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>vargas</strong>: The “plane crash guy”.</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: Is that all of them? Eight?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What “plane crash guy”?</p>
<p><strong>vargas</strong>: The one-shoe dude who saved all those
people, man. Channel Four gonna give him a million for an interview.</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: Come. on, hombre, we doin’ business here.
You got more or not?</p>
<p><strong>wallace/tv</strong>: The offer is absolutely unconditional.
All he has to do, is satisfy our reporter, Gale Gayley, and the other
passengers who had contact with him that he is indeed the brave man
who…</p>
<p><strong>bernie’s voice</strong>: HEY! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? WHAT’S
GOIN’ ON HERE?</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: You have the right to remain silent, you
have the right to –</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, this is bullshit! Do you guys know who
I am? You know where I got the goddamn plastic? I got a million bucks
coming. I’m the guy who…</p>
<p><strong>espinosa</strong>: You have the right to the counsel of an
attorney…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: CHICK, CALL MY ATTORNEY! THIS IS BULLSHIT!
ENTRAPMENT! I GOT A MILLION BUCKS COMING, FOR CHRISSAKE!</p>
<p><strong>news vendor</strong>: ONE MILLION DOLLAR REWARD TO THE
UNANIMOUS HERO! ONE MILLION BUCKS FOR THE “ANGEL” WHO SAVED FIFTY PEOPLE
AND TOOK OFF!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: PLEASE, IF YOUR FOOT ISN’T A SIZE 10-B,
DON’T REMAIN IN LINE. WE’RE ONLY SEEING SIZE 10-B “HEROES.”</p>
<p><strong>african american</strong>: Thass a racist perspective,
assuming that because something heroic was done that a white man done
it. A man with mud on his face could be a man of any color, most likely
was, which is true in this case cause it was me! With mud all over
me.</p>
<p><strong>1st fighter</strong>: You call me a liar, I’m gonna kick your
ass.</p>
<p><strong>2nd fighter</strong>: Hey, it’s not just <u>me</u> sayin’ you
ain’t no hero. Everybody in the goddamn line says you ain’t the
hero.</p>
<p><strong>another wannabe</strong>: Can you believe this? Must be more
than a thousand phonies after my reward.</p>
<p><strong>mud-face wannabe</strong>: HEY, MISS GAYLEY! HEY, GALE!
REMEMBER ME? I’M THE GUY! I SAVED YOUR LIFE! REMEMBER –</p>
<p><strong>tall wannabe</strong>: My foot’s only eight and a half but I
wear a ten B for the comfort. I swear! Hey, Miss Gayley, I saved your
life!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey, Miss Gayley, there’s a cop looking for
you. From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton. He wants you to call
him.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: I didn’t ask him.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Call him back. Ask him. I’m a little…busy.</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: Bail in this matter will remain in the
sum of five thousand dollars. Next.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: “The Angel of Flight 104!” You’re telling me
you’re the A…?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: “Angel!” I didn’t say “angel,” that’s a
little strong. Listen, here’s the thing, I gotta get over there to the
TV station to collect my million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you,
but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. The D.A. is asking
your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were
arrested again while you were out on bail…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Twenty-five grand is peanuts! All you gotta
do is get me outta here long enough to collect.</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: The People versus Bernard LaPlante.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Your honor, my attorney here says the
prosecutor there wants twenty-five grand bail…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Mister LaPlante, you will be silent unless
the court recognizes you…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: –which is fine by me. I got no problem with
that at all. In fact, your honor, I’d be proud to double it. Fifty
grand! A tip for “the people,” your honor, if I could just…</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: Mister LaPlante, unless you stop
chattering immediately, I am going to ask the Bailiff to…</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: DAMNIT! I SAID I WANTED ORDER!</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: Sorry, your honor…</p>
<p><strong>second bailiff</strong>: We got carried away.</p>
<p><strong>detaglio</strong>: They found him.</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: Found who?</p>
<p><strong>clay</strong>: The “Angel of Flight 104”.</p>
<p><strong>second bailiff</strong>: It was on the news! Just now! He’s
gonna be on Channel Four at noon!</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: We’ll sustain bail at twenty-five
thousand dollars. That ought to keep Mister LaPlante out of trouble for
a minute or two…</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: But your honor, my client is a responsible
family man with limited resources who…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: But finally you did come forward. Why?</p>
<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: The money, Gale. I wouldn’t have come
forward at all if it wasn’t for the reward.</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Cut right there, right on that
look!</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You didn’t mention he was cute.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>gale/tv voice over</strong>: –were shocked to learn that the
hero who appeared out of the smoke and the fire and pulled them to
safety was indigent and tragically hadn’t slept in a bed in more than
three years.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The guy’s a fake, for Chrissake! He’s a
goddamn homeless bum. He ain’t no here, trust me on this, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>big prisoner</strong>: “Trust you”!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: I thought they’d all go “It’s him! It’s
him!” and hug the guy or something.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Relax, Wally. He had the shoe and the shoe
checks out.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where’d
we put him?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite. Never stop
worrying. I figure we’ll do a sidebar on what it’s like to go from
sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest
suite in town. Also Gale’s onto something, digging into his
background.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Excuse me, Ms. Gayley. That guy Inspector
Dayton… he’s recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery
Detail who was looking for you. They caught the guy who stole your
credit cards trying to sell them and he wants…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Nobody stole my credit cards. They burned up
in the crash. Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the
reservations?</p>
<p><strong>tough prisoner #1</strong>: You mess with me, I’m gonna cut
yer heart out and eat it.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Very good, sir. It’s a special privilege to
serve you.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, er… I…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You were saying you don’t want a million
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Well, I’m not entitled to a million dollars.
I… I… didn’t expect… I didn’t expect…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: All the adulation? It makes you feel like a
fake, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, actually… yes… I… should never have come
forward and presented myself as –</p>
<p><strong>millionaire</strong>: You’re a credit to the goddamn human
race. Coulda been me in that plane. Or my family.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.
<u>You’ve</u> known John Bubber all your life, you’re used to him, you
know you’re the same human being you were before all the excitement. So
you feel like a fraud…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: …unworthy of the adoration. We all do.</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: I’m going to donate a half million to
charity in your name. Would small animals be all right?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, “small animals”?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: I knew a man like you would adore small
animals. God bless you, Mister Bubber. And you, my dear, you do so much
for women.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Is she… serious? A half a million dollars?
In my behalf?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You’re a celebrity, John. People are going to
want to please you… or use you… or both.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Come on, John.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Hey, hey, uh, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You, uh, want me to sign this? Uh, what’s
your name?</p>
<p><strong>sylvia</strong>: S-sylvia.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Hey, if I sign this, will you do me a
favor?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: What I’d like is… – maybe some of the rest
of you could help Sylvia here – what I’d like is if you’d scrounge up
some blankets – used ones, fifty maybe – and take ’em to the folks down
at the corner of Fifth and Grand. Pass ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>fat kid</strong>: Fifth and Grand!</p>
<p><strong>skinny kid</strong>: He means the homeless people. The
bums.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It gets cold down there at night. And
<u>you’ll</u> feel warmer for every person you give a blanket to.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I’ll bet they do it. I’ll bet they get some
blankets.</p>
<p><strong>gorgeous blonde</strong>: Uplifting! What you did was so
uplifting! You’re a saint, John Bubber!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, no. But I, uh, wonder if you could up
support… support a program to help the needy and…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: John, I’m sure she could support just about
anything. I think I’ll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard. Make
sure no harm comes to you.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a
small airfield…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It’s been sometime since, uh, I received
any, uh, of that kind of, uh… attention. A couple of… years.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Years? There are going to be lots of…
opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Gale… you’re a very nice person. I wouldn’t
want to hurt you… in any way…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I… I know that, John…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You… you think I saved your… life. I can’t
take advantage….</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You did save my life! And it’s <u>me</u>! I’d
be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I’m a reporter, John, an experienced
professional… I…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I… no… I don’t have the right… I…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: No, I don’t have the right. You’re a
<u>news</u> <u>story</u>!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, right. A… news story.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I know the truth, John. I’m flying in some
guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow. Interviewing them live on
network hookup!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Vietnam!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Goodnight, John.</p>
<p><strong>tom/tv</strong>: Next thing I know, I’m in this medical unit
an’ I see the other dude, the one who was with me when we got jumped,
the one who I thought was dead. There he is in the next bed. I says
“How’d we get here, brother? We dead or what?” He says, “That crazy
white brother, Johnny Bubber, he come back for us, hauled us out.” He
shoulda been wrote up, got a medal, but it was fate. Wasn’t no officers
around to observe it or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>charlie/tv screen</strong>: The sonofagun goes out in the
paddies, pulling us outta there, one after the other, six guys. Hey, it
don’t surprise me one bit it was Johnny Bubber went into that plane!</p>
<p><strong>bernie voice</strong>: Fifty bucks says the asshole was never
even in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>tough prisoner #2</strong>: Shut your face, dirt bag… That
guy’s a goddamn hero and you’re nothin’ but a cynical little turd.</p>
<p><strong>gale/voice over/tv</strong>: After an emotional reunion,
Bubber’s fellow veterans watched as station manager James Wallace
presented Bubber with a check for one million dollars…</p>
<p><strong>gale/tv</strong>: As Bubber reacted to his sudden wealth,
word came that the Secretary of the Army, responding to an urgent
resolution from the Senate has conferred on John Bubber the Medal of
Honor. This for his actions in Vietnam more than 20 years ago, heroism
that was not acknowledged at the time because it was not witnessed or
reported by a ranking officer. Later I spoke to him about his sudden
change in circumstances…</p>
<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: Well, I don’t feel… right… about all that
money, Miss Gayley. That’s too much money for one person. What I’m gonna
do is donate, uh, most of it to different organizations like the
Homeless Vets and stuff, and start up some programs… to help people.
See, when you’re out there in the cold like I was, on the streets or
sleeping under bridges or in your car, the worst thing, even worse than
the hunger and the cold, is the… feeling… that you’re just plain…
useless. You don’t matter to a single soul in this world, nobody needs
you, nobody wants you.</p>

<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: I guess when I… did what I did… I was
trying to save my own life more than anything else. Trying to connect
myself with people again and be… part of the whole. You have to help
others to do that, you need a role to, play… even if it’s a very humble
role, it gives you self worth.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Is he like that in real life? So gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He’s pretty… remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: You didn’t… get it on with him?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. I’m a reporter.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Reporters don’t have hormones?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Reporters… have to… rise above their
hormones.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: The guy’s… a natural.</p>
<p><strong>gale/tv/voice over</strong>: I asked John Bubber about the
Medal of Honor.</p>
<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: As far as the medal goes, well… that
medal’s for something me and my buddies did almost twenty years ago in
Viet Nam. So if I’m a war hero today then I was a war hero last week
when I was selling cans and sleeping in my car… when I didn’t have a
medal. I don’t think a medal makes a hero. You don’t need machinegun
fire or burning planes to be… brave. People do heroic acts every day
only there’s nobody around to take their picture or decorate them.
Little things can be heroic. Helping someone day in and day out, giving
up your life a little every day instead of all at once… to help. Maybe…
maybe we’re all heroes.</p>

fire, out of a nightmare of fear… came The Angel of Flight 104. John
Bubber saved fifty-four people. This is his story and theirs. A drama
featuring the actual people who actually lived those moments of terror.
No make-up, no music, no actors. This is the <u>real</u> <u>thing</u>.
Thursday night. Channel-Four. Be there!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Upset! What’s he upset about?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Said he’s not an actor.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: He’s not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor,
that’s the whole point. He’s a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all
he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero. That’s the
<u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.
Did she call him back?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: She’s talking to him now.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: We paid him a million dollars. You’d think
he’d want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He’ll do it. You really-should have talked to
him first.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: He might have said no.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Whaddaya mean they didn’t reduce the bail?
If they didn’t reduce it, how’dja spring me?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I took a loan on my car and my computer.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You whaaaaaat? You paid it? You gave a
bondsman ten percent?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his
neck out for others, how he took a chance…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy
who’s been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars?
A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>! You’re s’posed to
be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake! You’re s’posed to have <u>good
judgment</u>!</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: Well, as you like to point out, Mister
LaPlante, I’m relatively inexperienced. My naivete may have worked to
your benefit in this instance.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Well, you’re right, I’m glad you got me out,
I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five
hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: So you can call me “naive,” Mister
LaPlante.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, you could call me “Bernie,” forget the
“Mister LaPlante” stuff. You are naive.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: I read the probation report. It’s not good. I
think you’re going… going to prison, Mister… Bernie. I know that scares
you but..</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: TAXI! HEY, TAXI! Well, at least I’m gonna
get my goddamn million bucks. TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I seen on the TV where that do-gooder
asshole’s gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty. Children’s Hospital,
on the double.</p>
<p><strong>donna</strong>: You mean John Bubber?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That bozo don’t just owe me a million bucks
for my shoe, he’s a goddamn <u>menace</u>! Look what he done to you!
He’s makin’ people <u>insane</u>. He’s a <u>whacko</u>, he’ gotta be

<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Listen, kid, you gotta hang on. I know
you’re scared, we all get scared, but that’s when you have to fight…</p>
<p><strong>doctor.</strong>: I’m afraid he can’t hear you. He…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: He can hear me…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Listen… Allen, you’re in the darkness there
and it’s scary. The doctors are working on you but the tough part is for
you. You can’t quit!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I know you don’t know it, but you’re a hero.
Sometimes you don’t know how brave you are… and sometimes you don’t
know… you can do something… until you… until you surprise yourself and…
do it. But I know you’ve got the stuff, I know it in my heart. I want
you to struggle kid… for yourself, for all of us. For me. I… I really
need you to do this for me. I <u>need</u> you to get well, Allen.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, buddy, you’re with the media, right? I
got a story for you. Something fantastic. That guy Bubber, he’s a fake,
he…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: HEY! WATCH OUT! HOLD ON! FOR CHRISSAKE!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You were… very… inspiring.</p>

<p><strong>bubber</strong>: GOD BLESS US ALL!</p>
<p><strong>bernie’s voice</strong>: YA GODDAMN PHONY!</p>
<p><strong>bernie’s voice</strong>: BUBBER, YA GODDAMN FRAUD! THAT’S MY

<p><strong>bernie.</strong>: Don’t tell me what I can and can’t say.
This is America.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, suit yourself, buddy. If it makes you feel
better to insult a man who’s worth about a thousand of you, go ahead.
Like he says, “We’re all heroes,” pal. Even you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bullshit! What a lotta bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, have it your own way: you’re not a
hero.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, I don’t blame you for bein’ sore. I
know I screwed up gettin’ busted in here. You got a right to throw me
out.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I’m not gonna throw you out, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Thanks, Chick. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter/tv</strong>: The doctors who had believed the boy
had little or no chance for survival, now predict a slow but complete
recovery.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Helluva guy, ain’t he? Vietnam, plane crash,
now miracles.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Sorry, sir. Closed to the public..
No media either, sir, they’re taping a show and… Oh, right. Sorry about
that, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Now you lean down and free me from the seat. I
was caught and… that’s it. Good.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Now you help me up. Boy, you seem… taller. It
must be psychological… now that I know you saved my life…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Gale! I can’t go through with this! It’s…
it’s all wrong!’</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You’re doing fine. You didn’t actually lift me
though. It was more like you supported me.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: That’s not what I mean…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can
support me anytime, John.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Gale…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I just remembered. You were talking about
bodybuilding and swearing.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Bodybuilding!</p>
<p><strong>director’s voice</strong>: WE DON’T WANT ACTING, AS I SAID.
BUT WHEN WE DO A TAKE, GUYS, PLEASE DON’T LAUGH, OKAY? IT HAS TO PLAY
SERIOUS. IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS THING… UH, ALSO, JOHN, MAYBE YOU COULD
LIFT HER MORE, SORT OF CARRY HER. I KNOW THAT MAY BE BENDING REALITY
JUST A TEENSY BIT, BUT IF YOUR JOURNALIST’S INTEGRITY CAN HANDLE IT,
GALE, I THINK IT WOULD “PLAY BETTER” ON THE SCREEN. OKAY, GANG, LET’S
RUN THROUGH IT FROM THE TOP ONE MORE TIME, THEN WE’LL DO A TAKE.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It’s not right, Gale…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It’s no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better
carrying me. Oh, you mean because I wasn’t carrying my purse at the
time.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You’re an inspiration, John. You’re making us
better human beings. Less cynical. More open, more giving. Do you
realize that?</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: You leave her here… and you go back in
again.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a
burning plane an’ saved a buncha people, Chick, an’ risked my
goddamnlife?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: You mean like Bubber? The hero?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, like that. Same thing.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Well… I mean… what am I supposed to say here,
Bern? Is this a riddle or what?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya
wouldn’t, would ya?</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: It’s a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you
wouldn’t do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he’s
a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we’re not… heroic. It’s not our
nature. It don’t mean we’re bad or nothing. We’re just not so inclined.
What about it?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: I wouldn’t be depressed about it, Bern. A guy
don’t have to be heroic to be a human being.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The thing is, Chick. I’m goin’ down.</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Down. You mean jail? For that credit card
stuff? For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>bernie,</strong>: Not jail. Prison. And not that credit card
bullshit, that’s nothin’. I got a conviction. Sentencing tomorrow. Some
cases of paint I got involved with. Latex. I see this parole officer, he
writes a report to the judge says I’m “anti-social.”</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: “Anti-social.” Jesus, Bernie. How much paint
are we talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: A lot.</p>
<p><strong>youthful director</strong>: That’s a wrap, guys. I want to
thank you all. I think we did something very important here this
evening.</p>
<p><strong>make-up artist</strong>: Just let me get that gunk off your
face, Mister Bubber.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Uh, it can wait, I…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mister Bubber… uh, John… Kelly wants you to
sign an autograph for John Jr.</p>
<p><strong>dayton</strong>: Won’t take more than ten minutes. Fifteen at
the most. I’ll buy you, a cuppa coffee down the street.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Gale!</p>
<p><strong>smith</strong>: I breathe, I see the sun, I thank you. God
bless you. I’m alive because of you, every moment of life I owe to
you.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: How… how does this, whatsisname, the
“sleazebag,” <u>say</u> he got my cards?</p>
<p><strong>dayton</strong>: LaPlante? Ha! Which version? This bozo has
more stories than a newspaper. In one of them, <u>he’s</u> “the angel of
Flight 104!” <u>He</u> pulls you off the plane, saves your purse for
you, but forgets to return it. That’s Version 63. In Version 64, he kept
it to pay for his “hundred dollar shoes.” The guy’s a bullshit artist,
he’s already got a sentence pending for dealing stolen goods. Listen, I
know. this is pretty off the wall… that guy, the hero, Bubber… he was a
homeless guy, right? Down on his luck? He couldn’t have swiped the
wallet, could he? While he was rescuing you? And sold it to this guy
LaPlante?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: John Bubber risks his life to save me and
fifty-four other people and… swipes my purse?</p>
<p><strong>dayton</strong>: Too far-fetched? I mean, I’m not trying to
make problems for John Bubber, I just want to make sure this creep
LaPlante does some meaningful time. If we can’t figure out how he got
the cards, it makes it more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Tell me more about him.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Homework. You’re doing homework,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Homework, homework, homework! No homework,
no zoo trips, no movies. Hello. He’s doing his homework.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Look, I’m going away, I just wanna say
goodbye to… never mind where. I just wanna say… He can’t call me back
later, my phone’s disconnected…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s your father. If you don’t talk to him,
he’s going to call all night.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, Joey, how ya doin’, pal, it’s me. Your
old man. You get the twenty dollars? What? Well, she’s right on that,
Joey, that’s the best place for it, a college fund. I was gonna tell ya
that myself. Look, about how I didn’t show up the other night I… what?
You seen me out the window…. One shoe, yeah and the mud… So you thought
I mighta been the heroic guy, huh? An’ what’d she say when you…?
“Against my religion,” huh? Well, you know Joey, this kinda stuff, we
gotta talk about it some time, man to man. But I gotta go off on this –
this damn business trip now… for a while. So… so I won’t be seein’ you.
What you gotta do, you gotta listen to your mother, she’s smart, very
smart, knows what’s best for you and… No, no, no, it ain’t ’cause I
don’t like you, Christ! I mean, not “Christ,” you know… I mean I don’t
<u>wanna</u> go on this business thing, I love you Joey, but I
<u>gotta</u>! That’s part of growing older, all these goddamn business
things you have to do. Which reminds me, this “hero” business… one of
the things you learn as you get older is that life gets very
<u>complicated</u>… <u>weird</u> actually… people aren’t exactly like
they seem… nothing is… life gets unbelievable… this is normal as you
grow older and… huh? I was talking to Joey.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Your son actually wants to spend time with
you. If you let him down this time after popping back into his life…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Ev, you gotta understand, it’s this… this
goddamn business trip, no wait, don’t hang up, Ev, just a sec, listen, I
just wanna say one thing, okay? One thing! I know I kinda act like an
asshole sometimes. I know that. I know you were a good wife. I know I
fucked it up. I had a good thing an’ I blew it. I just want you to know
I know that, okay? I gotta go now. Business trip. It’s gonna be a
while.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: LaPlante! That asshole! I don’t… Hey, is
that you, from the tee vee? In person?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: We’re from Channel Four, yes. We’d like to
find –</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: “This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four
News!” Incredible. Unbelievable! For Bernie LaPlante! He’s a celebrity
now? ’Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: We couldn’t find his name on the buzzer or on
the mailbox, but…</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: “Low profile.” That’s his big motto! He
don’t put his name on anything. Come on, we’ll go look.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Shouldn’t we have buzzed him to let him know
–</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Half the time he don’t answer even if he’s
home. Know why? ‘Cause he don’t want no bill collectors to find him. I
don’t mean to be judgmental, but he’s a scumbag. He don’t have no
friends. Who’s gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin’ him a favor
on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin
you get on my set, Miss Gayley? Purple! That’s what color skin you got
on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Bernard! Bernard! Hey, LaPlante, open the
door. Television Interview! Fame and fortune. Open up, Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Hope the silly bastard didn’t kill himself.
He’s all upset about this sentence he got. He’s going to prison. That a
camera you’re carrying? If he killed himself, you could take
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: No dead body. Too bad. Not too often you
guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there.
Exclusive!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I wonder if you’d mind if we waited for him
here, Mister Winston…</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: What’s he gonna do, sue? You people, you’re
the media.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: We’re gonna wait here? The guy could be
hours.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is
important somehow.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Hey, listen, great that you’re a
career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You’re lucky, Chucky, you… OW!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: This sofa is a lethal weapon. The springs…
are… the springs… what…?</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: The…Silver…Mike…Award!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: This guy LaPlante won an award?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: “For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth.”</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: LaPlante!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Who the hell are you? What’s goin’ on
here?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Camera, Chucky. Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?
What is your relationship with John Bubber?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Turn that thing off.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?
Hey, put that thing down. This is my goddamn apartment, you can’t
just…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: What’s your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are
you forcing John Bubber to do? What are you – ?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: HE’S GONNA JUMP! BUBBER’S GONNA JUMP! IT’S
ON CHANNEL THIRTEEN!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Thirteen!</p>
<p><strong>channel 13 reporter</strong>: – say that they cannot rig a
net below him because they are afraid it will trigger his decision to
jump. Bubber has said repeatedly he will only talk with Gale Gayley a
local television reporter.</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>channel 13 reporter/tv</strong>: So far, attempts to reach
Ms. Gayley have not succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Your phone! Quick.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He’s green for Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: No shit! You took advantage of me,
LaPlante. It’s a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You gotta tune it, ya bozo. You gotta adjust
it.</p>
<p><strong>channel 13 reporter/tv</strong>: Meanwhile, as you can see, a
crowd has gathered here at the hotel, many of them in tears, pleading
aloud with John Bubber not to jump.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: For God’s sake, tell him I’m on my way. Let’s
go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too,
LaPlante.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Me!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: If you’re not in the car in ten seconds, I’ll
have the cops pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The cops! What kinda bullshit is this? Is
this America or – ?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Here! Here… ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much
have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Come on! Let’s go! John’s in danger.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Christ, you media people think you can just
buy people. Cheap.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: My fault! My fault! This nut case goes out
on a ledge and it’s my fault?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister
LaPlante I’m going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the
law.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?
I don’t get this. What about…?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John
Bubber. The whole country, in fact. And they’re not going to be happy if
he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little
money-grubbing low-life fence…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: “Harassed.” Cause I yelled at him when he’s
riding in his limo? The guy’s a thief, he took my…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic
moment of weakness. That’s not the same thing as a lifetime of petty
crime…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I’m not
perfect but I don’t get this at all, your attitude. I saved your…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your
sleaziest accomplishment yet… blackmailing a national hero…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: – saved your… whaaaaaaat? What?
Blackmailing…?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: You think I haven’t figured it out? Just
because the cops aren’t on to you yet doesn’t mean you’re home free. I’m
a veteran reporter. I’ve seen your kind before, the underbelly of
crime.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Underbelly!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment
of weakness. He’d been down and out, destitute, living in his car. It
was just an impulse, stealing my purse.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Swiped your purse! While he was saving you?
You gotta be kidding!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence,
who’s now trying to blackmail poor John.</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: He’s gotta be a nut! He saves all those
people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He
was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.
He didn’t expect the media to lionize him. He didn’t expect a million
dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him,
some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane
when “good sense” told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some
credit cards he sold to LaPlante…. For how much, LaPlante? A couple of
bucks? Did you give him enough for a decent meal?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: All this is off the record, Chucky, because if
John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance
that there will be no more “misbehavior” on his part. What’s more he’s
going to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m going to apologize to Bubber?</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I could deny I had those credit cards on the
plane with me, LaPlante…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Lie, you mean…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well, maybe I wouldn’t lie…but I could tell
the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that
John is even more of a hero, and that you… you’re the lowest thing that
ever crawled. Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and
blackmail. You won’t get a cent.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I got a kid, you know. I’m a person, for
Chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Well, for your child’s sake, show some decency
then, rise above your sleazy instincts. You may have already killed
him!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: No! He’s with us, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>channel 8/channel 13/conklin</strong>: Police are escorting
Reporter Gale Gayley to the fifteenth floor where she will be able to
talk to Bubber.</p>
<p><strong>police chief</strong>: He’ll only talk to you, Ms Gayley.
Just lean out and we’ll hold you from behind.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: John! Don’t do it! Everything’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Gale! This is for you. I want you to know I
never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: John, I know all about it.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: NNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: It’s all right, John! It’s nothing! A little
mistake. Everybody will understand!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: “A little mistake”!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: No, John, you’re too hard on yourself. I’ve
got the creep here, the guy who’s…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hold on! Hold on! Lemme talk to him for
Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, Bubber, c’mere! I gotta talk to you,
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: LaPlante!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Come on, John, don’t be an asshole. I don’t
like heights.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Listen, LaPlante, I’m really sorry. It’s all
in my letter to Ga… uh, Miss Gayley. I was all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Turn that thing off! You want him to
jump?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I just wanna talk with you for a minute.
Then you can jump. You can jump twice for all I care.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Talk from there. You can talk from
there.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: In private. They got cameras and alla that
crap in there. Microphones.</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: It looks like someone is out on the
ledge with John Bubber. We can only presume this is a rescue specialist
of some kind from the police or fire department. He… he’s moving toward
Bubber, crawling. He does not appear to have a safety rope tied to him
and, as we’ve explained, the fire department has been unable to rig a
net.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: That’s for Ga… Ms. Gayley.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What am I, a goddamn postman? I’m way the
fuck up here, I’m scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?
Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: That’s close enough. It’s a confession. The
truth. Jesus, I’m sorry, LaPlante. I had the shoe, you said you didn’t
want, publicity because of your legal problems.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t recall saying I didn’t want a
million bucks…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I never really thought they’d go for it. And
then… you didn’t come forward, they investigated my war record… I kept
expecting you to show up and expose me…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I was in the can, for Chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: The bathroom! For two days?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jail! Listen, Bubber… This is crazy. We
could fall off of here.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You should go in. You’re risking your life
again…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m beginning to… be aware of that, John.
Listen, I’m not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that,
buddy. Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don’t have no
tricks, I’m not that smart. You could, like, rest up for the jump.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: What have I done? I was dirt poor and
useless… but I was honest.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Lighten up, John. You think <u>you</u> got
problems for Chrissake?</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: – still don’t know why John BUbber, hero
to the nation, stepped out onto the ledge fifteen stories above the
street more than an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: But we now have the identity of the man
who has been talking to him for the last fifteen minutes at great
personal risk. He has been identified as Bernard LaPlante, former
employee of Gumley’s Carpet Care.</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: There is speculation that LaPlante is an
old friend of Bubber’s, perhaps a war buddy.</p>
<p><strong>joey’s voice</strong>: MOM! MOM! IT’S MY FATHER! MOM!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: I’m gonna grab the high ground, get a hot
overhead angle.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You stole her purse! While you were saving
her?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What’s the big deal? You decided to pretend
you were me. A little moment of weakness, right? So I sorta swiped her
purse. I got feet of clay too, bUddy.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: And she thinks you’re blackmailing me?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Which don’t sound like such a bad goddamn
idea, John.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Huh? Whadda you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.
It’s a goddamn mess an’ I’m halfway to doing serious time in the joint
an’ the TV lady’s so stuck on you she don’t want it to come out you
stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions. Looka
those maniacs, willya? They love you, for Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I don’t need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I
can’t face people… the looks in their eyes… after the trust they gave
me!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Great! You make this big goddamn mess, then
ya jump. Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I
seen you with those little bastards .</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It was you! I thought I heard…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m not saying I hate sick people or
anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.
There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>. I
probably woulda vomited on him.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Allen? He… he’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: See what I mean? You remember his
<u>name</u> for Chrissake! I mean, I remember my <u>own</u> kid’s name…
but I’m always forgetting his birthday. Plus when they stick cameras in
your face and ask all these stupid questions, you <u>smile</u> at them.
You got a kinda… a kinda… “gift,” there, John, if ya know what I mean.
People wanna be saved by you. Even <u>me</u>! If I was gonna be saved I
wouldn’t wanna see Bernie LaPlante comin’ outta the goddamn smoke an’
darkness an’ fear an’ stuff. I’d wanna see <u>John</u> <u>God</u>
<u>Damn</u> <u>Bubber!</u></p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: You got those people out of the plane,
LaPlante, not me.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you
wouldn’ta thought twice… Trust me on that, that’s the kinda guy you are.
For a guy like me, it’s a momentary loss of sanity. I wasn’t thinking
clearly. Listen, I’m no hero, John. I just want some dough and maybe a
little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder
bullshit? You didn’t spend it <u>all</u> didja?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Well, I donated a lot to different causes,
uh… La…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bernie. Call me Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: –but there’s a lot of it still left, uh,
Bernie. Almost half.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna
know everything. Who’s this screwball LaPlante for Pete’s sake, what the
hell’s he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You’re
supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don’t… “Quit!” You can’t quit! It’s
unprofessional!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Quit? She wants to quit?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Listen, Gale, I know you’re emotionally
involved. Don’t be emotionally involved, be professional. No, Gale, you
are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are. You are
a goddamn cream puff! Try and be a hard-ass!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: She wants to quit?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: She can’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: My God! It… it <u>is</u> him!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Wh-why’s he… why’s he up there, mom?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Where’s your coat? Get your coat!</p>
<p><strong>channel 8 reporter/tv</strong>: – just learned that LaPlante
is a convicted felon due to be sentenced tomorrow for trafficking in
stolen goods. According to our sources, LaPlante knowingly purchased
twelve cases of stolen latex paint which he subsequently sold to…</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she’s
the one who found this clown LaPlante! She let Channel Eight get a beat
on us.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got
something to hide? What if he’s the wrong guy, not really the hero…?</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Helluva story!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: No, Deak, not a great story. We backed this
guy, he’s our boy! We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a
million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>conklin’s voice/tv</strong>: Something’s going on, Bubber is
communicating something. Both men are…</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: – still sitting on the ledge but Bubber is
motioning to someone in the window, he seems to be calling out to them
and now… now he’s holding up two fingers. He’s signalling something,
holding up two fingers.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: If I gave you the impression I hated him I
didn’t mean to. I… I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>… he’s selfish and
self-centered and cynical…</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: What’s “cynical”?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s when you say, “Everybody else cheats
why shouldn’t I?” But I don’t – I don’t <u>hate</u> – him. I… loved him
once, Joey. Very much. I just got… tired. Maybe it wasn’t all his fault.
He… What’s happening? Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: – FIREMEN LEANING OUT THE WINDOW! THEY HAVE
WHAT APPEAR TO BE LONG POLES AND THEY’RE REACHING THE POLES TOWARD THE
TWO MEN ON THE LEDGE, JOHN BUBBER AND HIS COMPANION, BERNARD
LAPLANTE!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What’s happening? What are they doing…?</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: LAPLANTE AND BUBBER ARE REACHING FOR THE
POLES! THERE’S SOMETHING AT THE TIP OF THE POLES. THEY’RE TAKING
SOMETHING FROM THE POLES! IT LOOKS LIKE – IT LOOKS LIKE… I THINK IT’S…
WAIT A MINUTE, I HAVE A REPORT HERE…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: COFFEE! IT’S COFFEE! WE’RE TOLD THAT BUBBER
AND LAPLANTE ASKED FOR TWO CUPS OF COFFEE.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Coffee! Just like your father to request
something totally inappropriate. Thousands of people watching and he
wants a cup of coffee. I remember when you were in the hospital, when
you had the appendicitis, your father stayed all night by your bed… and
he hates hospitals, always thinks he’s going to catch something… and
then that time when your Uncle Howard got hurt… It seems like your
father is at his best in a crisis… when things go really wrong or
there’s some kind of emergency, your father forgets to be Bernie
LaPlante and acts sort of like… a human being.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: We’ve learned that the devices the firemen
used to “deliver” the coffee… I described them as “poles”… are, in fact,
oversized tongs used by the hotel staff to change difficult-to-reach
lightbulbs…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You got it? Four year scholarship to a top
college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay
off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual
consulting fee…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: And give a deposition to the jUdge.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Listen, John, you better double my
attorney’s fee. She’s very inexperienced, but she done a great job for
me. And give her your autograph. She thinks you’re some kinda holy
man.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie… I
mean there’s no way I can promise anything. I can’t tell him what we’re
up to…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You’ll tell him I talked you out of jumping,
right? Just keep me outta prison.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: I… I’ll do the best I can, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That’s good enough for me. You better take
that “letter” there and get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: They’re getting to their feet. They’re
standing up!</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: After what I did, how do you know I’ll come
through? How do you know you can trust me?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Cause, bottom line, John, I ain’t no
different than all those dumb assholes down there. We all trust you for
Chrissake! We…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Th-this was really dumb, coming out
here.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Slow and easy, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: What made you do it, Bernie? Go in the
plane?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I dunno. It was… an impulse. Me, wearing my
good shoes.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Same with me, pretending I was you. An
impulse. Why not? I had this shoe.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: There was this kid there saying, “Go in
there and save my father, mister.” And I’m thinking about my boy Joey
and this goddamn fireman my wife’s seeing. It was like I was supposed to
save myself.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed
to pretend the shoe was mine.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.
Everyday you gotta be everybody’s hero. People watching you all the
time. Waiting for you to make… a slip. Slip up.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Easy does it, partner. It’s gonna be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>bubber’s voice</strong>: Don’t look down. Keep your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh my God! Bernie!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Get in here, buddy. You can’t help him.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Don’t reach out. He’ll pull you over!</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: NO! NEVER REACH OUT!</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Grab this! Now! Save yourself, you can’t
help him, he’ll pull you over!</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: I’m gonna put this line around you.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Put…the…line…on…him.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: You can’t hold him, he’s gonna pull you
off.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: If he doesn’t make it… I… don’t… make it.
Got it?</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Yessir! I got it! Loud and clear!</p>
<p><strong>chucky</strong>: Zooming in tighter yet, he captures the
stark drama at great personal risk. “Was I afraid? Well, you don’t think
about yourself at moments like that. You think about the f-stop, you
think about focus, you think about the 11 o’clock news, everybody
counting on you.”</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: Bernie? Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: LaPlante, you crazy bastard!</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: He’s one of your <u>clients</u>?</p>
<p><strong>judge goines</strong>: LaPlante. Mmmmmmmm. LaPlante.</p>
<p><strong>a series of tv sets and watching faces all over america,
young,</strong>: OLD, BLACK, WHITE, EVERYBODY IN AMERICA IS STARING AT
THE SCREEN, MESMERIZED…</p>
<p><strong>-home</strong>: -MOTEL ROOM -CHEAP HOTEL LOBBY -BAR -JAIL
CELL</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Looking… good, partner. Hang in there.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Y-you’re a g-god damn saint, John.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It was a moment of terrible weakness. I was
feeling… I guess you’d call it “overwhelmed” by all the pressures and…
the expectations of… fame… celebrity. I just didn’t feel… adequate… to
everybody’s image of me… so… I took my despair out on that ledge with
the intention of… jumping…</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: In doing that I endangered the lives of
hardworking policemen and firemen who attempted to rescue me, not to
mention the life of my dear friend, Bernard LaPlante…</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Who is Bernard LaPlante? Did you know
that LaPlante is a convicted criminal? What is your relationship with
Bernard LaPlante…?</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Bernard LaPlante is a close friend who came
to me in a time of need… at considerable risk to himself.</p>
<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: I guess Bernie’s made some mistakes. I
know I’ve made plenty myself. In fact I don’t know anyone who hasn’t. I
think Bernie wants to be a private person and I I’m going to respect
that.</p>
<p><strong>reporters/tv</strong>: What’d he say to you? What’d you talk
about?</p>
<p><strong>bubber/tv</strong>: Well, what he said to me was private. But
he gave me confidence in myself. He told me I had a special opportunity,
the chance to do some good in the world.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey! How’d you get in? Nobody’s supposed to
come in here!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: I snuck in.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You media people, you think you can just go
anywhere you want, spy on people.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Listen, Mister LaPlante… uh, Bernie… Who… are…
you?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Who am I? You’re asking me? You’re the big
expert for Chrissake! I’m what? The “Scumbag,” right? The sleazebag
something or other, the blackmailer, the…</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my
life?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Me? Listen, I don’t give no interviews. That
was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my
attorney, Miss O’Day.</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: Mister LaPlante… Bernie… I… just for a few
moments… I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I’m somebody who
was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came
out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and… and he… saved
my… life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was?
Because you took my purse? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Lady, do I look dumb enough to run into a
burning plane and save a bunch of strangers? I ain’t the type.</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: – standing here in the lobby of the
hotel with Evelyn LaPlante who says she is the wife of the mysterious
Bernie LaPlante who was rescued from a fifteenth story ledge twenty
minutes ago by John Bubber.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh shit! Ev! Joey! For Chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: Mrs. LaPlante just told me that Bernard
LaPLante spoke to her earlier today about “going away on a long trip”
and wanting to say “goodbye” to his ten-year-old son, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn/tv</strong>: I didn’t know Bernie’d try and jump off a
building. I didn’t understand. I just thought he was up to his old… I
mean, I didn’t even know…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: TV! Christ Almighty! You cannot believe one
word on TV! Not one goddamn word!</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: What kind of man is your ex-husband
Mrs. LaPlante?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn/tv</strong>: Bernie LaPlante is a wonderful decent
human being. Deep down. You just have to know him…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It’s all bullshit! I swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: I guess you love your father too,
Joey?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: LEAVE MY BOY ALONE, YOU ASSHOLE!</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Yeah, my dad’s great. He took me to the
zoo.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: JOEY!</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: How did you feel, Joey, seeing your
father up there on that ledge?</p>
<p><strong>joey/tv</strong>: I was scared but… but… but…</p>
<p><strong>conklin/tv</strong>: But what, son?</p>
<p><strong>joey/tv</strong>: But I knew John Bubber would save him!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Were you afraid? Look this way, John. John,
over here. Mister Bubber, do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>gale’s voice</strong>: Mister Bubber! Mister Bubber!
JOHN!</p>
<p><strong>gale</strong>: John Bubber… how does a person know when he’s
a hero… and when he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: Well, like. I said, Miss… uh, Gale, I think
we’re all heroes. If you catch us at the right moment. We all have
something noble and decent in us trying to get out… and we all have
moments of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>bubber</strong>: It’s the media that notices one moment and
one person and not another. I’m just another human being like the next
person, full of frailty with some courage and decency mixed in.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What a crock of shit! Have you ever heard
more bullshit and drivel from somebody who wasn’t President?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: It’s not unthinkable.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: The Presidency. The public loves him.</p>
<p><strong>deakins</strong>: For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.
I’m sick of him and I’m always about ten minutes ahead of the
public.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You remember where I said how I was gonna
explain about life, buddy? Well, the thing about life is… it gets weird.
See people are always gonna be talking to you about “truth.” Everybody
always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something
and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older
is, there ain’t no truth. All there is is bullshit . Layers of it. One
layer of bullshit on top of another. So what you do in life, like when
you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that’s
<u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Mmmmm. Well, it’s complicated. Maybe when
you’re older. Anyhow, what I’m gonna tell you here is in strict
confidence, okay? It don’t go no further. What happened is, you remember
that night I was gonna take you to the movies an’ it was raining like a
sonofabitch, ..?</p>
