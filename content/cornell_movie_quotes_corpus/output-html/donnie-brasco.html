OFFICE. American flag, FBI seal, and a plush c arpet– Fed eral blue .
CLENDON HOGUE, 40s, barrel chest, shrewd eyes over half-moon glasses,
PRESIDES behind a vast desk. The impressive mien of earned authority.
Before him: JULES BONOVOLONTA, late 40s, Green Beret veteran,
SUPERVISOR, 140 pounds of pugnacity and gristle. Ex-street agent cramped
by headquarters. PAT MARSHALL, late 30s, a CASE AGENT, compulsively
organized, with haunted choirboy’s eyes. CLARENCE LEBOW, early 40s.
Assistant SECTION CHIEF. Brooks Brothers, heavy starch.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: It’s going down tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Says who? A fucking wire.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: A reliable wire.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: A fiction writer.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: is that the 209, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: There’s going to be a war between Sonny Red
and Sonny Black–it’s all over the streets.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Clarence, you couldn’t find the streets with
an asphalt detector.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Sonny Black goes, everyone with him
goes.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s doesn’t mean it’s tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: Even if it’s not tonight–and I ’ m not saying
it’s not tonight–it could still be tonight because it could be any
night.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Fuck you, Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: Heyl I’m a Mormon 1</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: You have some objection to these guys killing
each other? .</p>

us.</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: An informant?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: An agent. Undercover.</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: Then why are you depending on an informant?
What does the agent say? When’s the last time you spoke to him?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Three weeks and two days.</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: He checks in every three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He checks in when he checks in, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We had to make up the rules as we went
along–</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: My predecessor started this?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: His predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: It’s been five years.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Five years and three months.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I am not gonna blow a chance to cripp le the
entire fucking Mafia just because some fucking empty suit in Blue Carpet
Land–</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: I am so sick of your superior New Y or k a tt
it ud e–</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: –thinks there’s gonna be a Shootout tonight
after the fucking tarantella.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: You’re going to risk a man’s life just to
make cases.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Making those cases is his life.</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: And how many cases do we have?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: A hundred, two hundred…</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>jul es</strong>: The truth is we don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>hogue</strong>: Let me get this straight. Nobody knows where
he is. Nobody’s spoken to him. He’s been undercover five years. He might
very well get killed tonight–at a fucking wedding– not because he’s one
of us. but because he’s one of t;hem. -</p>

the table. Jules delivers a TOAST. Supered below:</p>
<p><strong>blackie’s. washington, d.c.</strong>: 1975.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: …And so, Joe, we wish you bon voyage with
this farewell drink. We’d give you a farewell dinner - but why spend all
that money when you’ll just come crawling back to your old desk?</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: I would love to know how you sold them on
this.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I told them I wanted to get far away from
you, Clarence, They got it instantly.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: We’ve had our best guys on this s ince, wha
t, Va lachi ? Twe nty years?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: W ho knows? We never tried anything like
this.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The Director thought it would be too
corrupting.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Then maybe I should do it. I’m in a mood to
be corrupted.</p>
<p><strong>lebow</strong>: You know what these people are l ike. They
’re a ll ma rried to each other’s cousin.</p>

Jerse y.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re kidding1 You got transferred?</p>

suit but th ere’s al ways a button that comes off or a stain that won’t
come out —it’s li ke the suit knows I don’t belong in it. I sit in a
room w ith Clarence and the rest of them and the only way I know
something’s funny is when everyone else laughs. Everything, all day, it’
s just this much off.</p>
<p><strong>ma ggie</strong>: You ’re as smart as they are.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I could be a fucking Ph.D. from Ha r vard and
it wouldn’t matter– I cannot win. To do something th at’s never been
done, that they sa y can’t be done, that they ca n’t do– don’t you see?
That’s th e only way I’m ever gonna fit in with them. On my terms.</p>
<p><strong>m aggie</strong>: Well, at least you warned me. Re member?

<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Yeah. I told you, in California.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: That’s a good thing. One broad’s enough.
She’s a good woman, Louise. My son Tommy, she’s more of a mother to him

Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: …He comes home at all hours of the night,
without announcing when or why, or where he’s been for three weeks. Or
three months. Then he expects everything to be just the way he wants it.
Be vacuums the entire house. Do you know another man who vacu ums? It’s
abno rmal. Of course, he expects the girls to drop their lives when he
shows u. . . p</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I ’ m their father, Maggie. I ring that
doorbell I expect them home.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: They think it’s a Jehovah’s witness. You’d
think he’d tell me where he goes or w ha t h e’ s d o in g–</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: That’s for your own protection.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hal I know he’s ch ea t in g o n m e–</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I don’t have to listen to that bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, why don’t you just leave? That’s what
you’re good at.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Please just listen without saying a nyt hin
g–t hat ’s t he tas k f or today. Oth erwise you just rep lay the old
pathology. Maggie, you were talking about Joe’s disappearances.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I nev er go o ut any mor e. What couple
wants to go out with a- t hird whee l? Even wh en he’s ho me it’s not
like we have any friends any more.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: So you resent him for expressing your
autonomy needs?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes, I resent him.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: For expressing your autonomy needs.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: And you, Joe–what do you think you’re
running from?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I ain’t runnin’ from nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: ‘I ain’t runnin’ from nuttin’. The man I
married was a college man. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Being the distancer forces Maggie into the
role of the pursuer. That gives you a feeling of power. Simultaneously
you resent Maggie for expressing the very intimacy needs that in your
own li fe yo u ’v e–</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: . I ’ m an undercover agent for the</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I didn’t marry the FBI, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Okay. I want yo u to spli t the week in
half. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are Joe’s intimacy days. Tuesdays,
Thursday s, and Saturdays are Maggie’ s. On your day, you make one
intimacy request. Your partner agrees in advance to meet it. Whatever it
is.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: What’s that—an intimacy request?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: A n i nti mac y r eque st. Li ke ‘Ru b my
back,’ or ‘Help me work out this problem with the kids.’ Odd day, even
day, Sunday’s off. And mastur bate. I r ecommend i t, for both of you.
It’s a good way to blow off stress.</p>
<p><strong>47 int. evening. cadillac</strong>: Donnie drives. Maggie
SULKS, looks out the window.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: How much is this costing?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Okay, Maggie–I want you to answer my
question. This is my intimacy request.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: A hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: That was a hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That’s what I said, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: A hundred dollars. And how many of these do
you think we’ll need?</p>
<p><strong>. . maggie</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: One hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Is this still your intimacy request? Because
otherwise I’d rather not discuss it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I gotta work a ten hour day risking my life
to make a hundred dollars!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Who are you risking your life for? Not me,
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: ‘Will you rub my back’? Va’a’fonaooll</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re an animal.</p>
<p><strong>d o n ni e</strong>: You know wha t my intimacy request is fo
r him? It’ s very in timate. He can take that bill he’s gonna send me
and shove it up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re an animal1 Animal1</p>
<p><strong>a tractor trailer</strong>: Donnie SWERVES. The car tumbles
off the road onto a soft shoulder. Maggie continues to hit at Donnie. He
wrestles with her.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I hope those guys you’re hanging out with
are laying you because I ’ m not anymore!</p>
<p><strong>kiss passionately</strong>: grappling in the front seat…He
grabs her. Pulls her toward him. Realizes that she is encumbered by
something. She deftly unhooks the bel t. Ki sses his neck. ..</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Maggie–who told you to wear a seat belt?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: It’s a simple question. You never wore a
seat belt before/ Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Wait a minute–is this–you think I’m having
an affair?</p>
<p><strong>d o n n ie</strong>: I didn’t s ay that. It’s interesting
that you would say that, though.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re right–I ’ m secretly seeing a man who
wants me to ‘Buckle Up for Safe ty’. We h ave t hree child ren, Joe–r
emember t hem? One of us has to play it safe.</p>
<p><strong>out on the shoulder</strong>: with cars whipping by…Donnie
chases after her.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I just asked a simple question. You’re the
one that brought it up with the affair.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Bulls hit. It’s so fr iggi ng ironic that
you’d think I ’ m up to s omet hing. My n ights are homework and
basketball games. What are your nights?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: You know what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I don’t know a goddam thing.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I’m doing the job. That’s the job.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I live like a widow, Joe. That’s the only
way I can deal with this, with the photographs and memories and our
children, and I go on with my life. Like you’re already dead.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: It’s for your own protection.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s not protecting me–it’s killing me.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. night. pistone home</strong>: Maggie sleeps. Donnie
lies awake.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: When did you all of a sudden from nowhere
start saying, ‘Do it’, Maggie?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: what? Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: ‘Do it.’ You never said that– ‘Do it’. You
never talked that way before.</p>

about that car…Turns again. A scowl of RECOGNITION plays across Donnie’s
face. And he goes COLD…Approaching an intersection:</p>

the intersection as the yellow light goes RED…Checks his mirror–the
other car is STUCK at the light.</p>

Black is one big fat fucking snake in the, uh, uh…</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Snake in the grass,</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: You can’t say that, Donnie. Sonny Black is
the skipper. You don’t open your mouth about ’him.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I was agreeing with you.</p>

<p><strong>calvino</strong>: Napolitan’. Banquet room, six tennis

<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: So whaddaya think?</p>

<p><strong>ni c ky</strong>: You just said you never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>lefty</strong>: That’s right. I never heard of such a fucking
thing.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: It’s like part of their religion, Left . I

<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Donnie.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The loansharking predicates are very
specific. It’s really important that you focus on these things.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: What about the boat? I need that fucking
boat. You know, I ask Berada to do something and he just says,
‘Done’.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Maybe that’s why he’s in the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I ’ m not the kind of guy that breaks his
promises.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s what Mom said.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I’m sure that’s only part of what Mom
said.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: That’s between you two.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: W ha t’ d s he sa y– sh e w an ts a divorce?
That’s just her way of blowing off steam.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: She was worried something happened to

Nothing’s gonna happen to us – I won’t le t it. Okay ?</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Look, I understand. It’s your job.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: I ’ m doing the right thing. I know i t’s a

<p><strong>terry</strong>: It was just a birthday party, D ad. You d

<p><strong>sherry</strong>: Sorry I ’ m late.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Okay. I called this family meeting because
there’s something we have to t alk a bout. I kn ow what I’m doing
involves a lot of sacrifice from everyone, but this is something
patriotic for the country that you can all be proud of. I called the
meeting because we’re gonna have to move.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: I ’ m not moving.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: This isn’t a democracy, Terry. This is a
dictatorsh ip. And that’s my decision. It’s getting too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Well, I don’t want to move eithe r, Joe. Mo

<p><strong>donnie</strong>: There’s too many people here who know
us.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Those people are known as ‘friends,’ Joe.
You told me when we started this that we’d be moving back close to the
family. That was the deal.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: We’re moving to Minnesota and changing our
name to ‘Anderson’. That’s the deal. It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: ‘Anderson’? Yeeccch..</p>

Kenny.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: That language is unacceptable, y oung lady .
You sit down.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Well, Mr. ‘Anderson’, you’ve topped
yourself. Where’d you get that name– ‘Father Knows Best’?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Where are you going? Don’t you want to
discuss this?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Apparently there’s nothing to discuss. I’m
going to get the mail.</p>
<p><strong>kerry</strong>: What about our friends?</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: You’ll make new friends.</p>
<p><strong>sherry</strong>: We’re not in the FBI, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>donnie</strong>: Minnesota’s great. Lakes and everything. We
can get a nice piece of land there. Maybe we can even get a horse.</p>

Lefty and Nicky BANGl and another flash. BANGl BANG! BANG!</p>
<p><strong>108 continued:</strong>: Then a pause. Nicky reaches up,
screws in the light bulb. Lights on. Revealing the blasted corpses of
Sonny Red and Big Trin…</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: jumps out from behind a cabinet, RUNS out the
door. Sonny wheels, FIRES. The stairs SPLINTER as the blast lands just
under Bruno’s escaping feet. Lefty moves to chase him.</p>
<p><strong>s9nny</strong>: Fuggedaboudit, Left. We’ll give the contract
to Donnie.</p>

He closes the door. Flips the light switch.</p>

his weight bench and starts to swing…</p>
<p><strong>smase1</strong>: and an electric sizzle as the television
implodes. Donnie drops the bar and throws a bookcase to the ground.
PUNCHES at the wall…Again and again and again…Then sags to the

have to argue with t hem that he hasn’t gone over to t he other

wish he’d become a gangster–at least we could pay our frigging
bills.</p>
<p><strong>jule s</strong>: Maybe you could talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Do you know what this is about, J ules? Thi

made guy.</p>
<p><strong>close on–jules</strong>: as he hears this…He knows that this
has gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: For years I tried to figure out what m ade
Joe t ick. And t hen I finally figured it out–there’s nothing ti cking.
He’ s got his rules and he’s gonna live by his rules . The job is the
job . Start what you finish. When he’s in the FBI he wants to be the
best and when he’s in the Mafia h e wants t o be the”b est–like it’s all
some frigging basketball game. Men.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Maggie…Maybe this is none of my business,

you can cheat, you can steal, you can whack out whoever you want and
it’s all completely legitimate. Being a made guy’s the greatest thing in
