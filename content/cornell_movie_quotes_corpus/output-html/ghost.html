<p><strong>molly</strong>: What a mess!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I told you!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Use your mask, dummy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Volga boat…, man.” Whoomph!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam, look, there’s a whole eight feet up
there.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And about eighty years of dust.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: We have all this height, Sam. We could add a
second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this
space.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: For space. Just space.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Be great for bumper cars.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam, this may be none of my business, but I’m
concerned you’re doing too much coke.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hey, Sam, turn around.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: How ’bout me?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll never wash again.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: All together now. One, two, three.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, look what I found. There’s a penny inside.
For luck in our new loft. It’s a good omen.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You’re the good omen.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you could
sell it tomorrow and double your investment.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What I wouldn’t do for a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s gonna be great.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move your 3:00
with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He called
yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff. Three
o’clock was the only time he could make it. Also, the board meeting in
L.A. has been confirmed for the 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m.
flight.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, Sam, relax. This isn’t brain surgery
you’re going into.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I hate pitching to these Japanese guys. They
make me nervous. I mean, what am I supposed to say, “Who do you think’ll
win that big Sumo championship”?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam, you’ll be fine. You’re great with
people.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, nice. I like those.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: …Molly.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa. That’s the
car I’m gonna drive when I’m making two hundred grand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Better pay off your Mustang first.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So Carl, what did the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: He said it was contagious. Very contagious. I
shouldn’t be going into work today. But what could I do?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And what about the rash?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Not good. It’s spreading everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: On your genitals again?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Everywhere. He said be sure not to touch
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Morning, Mr. Wheat.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Morning Rose. Listen, when the Kobiashi people
arrive, have Elenore take them right to the…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: They’re already here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They’re early!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I know. And Andy Dillon called. He said they
need $900,000 transferred to Albany by noon.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Noon? Damn!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in Albany by
noon. Can you transfer it to his payroll account?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Discretion, huh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You bet. I’ll do it right away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf of Market
Security Bank &amp; Trust, I welcome you to our city.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Arigato.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m afraid that’s the only Japanese I know. But
I realize it’s not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you
to Market Security. Rather, I’m sure, it is our banking expertise, our
ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you
know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York. But,
with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm
commitment to the international marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Excuse me. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: A man and a woman are lying in bed when the
woman’s husband suddenly comes home. Frightened, she tells the man he
has to leave instantly through the window. He has no time to dress.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh hmm.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s raining outside. The man, running naked
along the street, sees some joggers approaching.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: One of the joggers calls out. “Hey, do you
always go jogging naked?” And the man says, “Yes, always.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: And then the other jogger says, “And do you
always wear a condom?” The man looks down, embarrassed, and replies,
“Only when it’s raining.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, that’s just fine.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Now just relax and have fun, okay? It’s not
the end of the world if you lose this account. You’ve always got me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you. I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Where you guys from, the New York City
Ballet?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You bastard. Don’t do that to me. You scared
me half to death.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Better than seeing this gorgeous body
splattered all over the street. Here, look out.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam? Molly? Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl? Did you invite him?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I couldn’t keep him away.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how’s it goin?</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Where do you want this?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: In the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Wow! The place looks great. Really great.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You like it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: “Like” is hardly the word. I never imagined it
would be this beautiful. This is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam, you kept that chair?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you mean? It’s comfortable. For T.V. I
love that chair.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: But it doesn’t go with anything.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It goes with me.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s okay, I’ll paint it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It was the middle of December. I was sitting in
my old office, the one Charlie’s in. Suddenly, I heard this woman
screaming. I thought someone’d been shot or something.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: They took away my MasterCard. It was
Christmas, for godssake.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She was four thousand dollars over her
limit.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It wasn’t four thousand. And I’d already sent
in the payment! You’re the ones that lost it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s still angry.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Get outta here, Frank! You should have seen
her. All pink and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. And she’s
screaming, demanding to see the president. So Wilton brought her to
me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You? You weren’t even a VP yet.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Can you believe it? And the next thing I
know, he’s telling me his life story. I couldn’t believe it. Everything.
About his divorce, how he’d just arrived in New York, how he didn’t know
any women. And all with this Montana accent.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s a Montana accent?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: The one you always slip into it when you get
nervous. “Yes, Ma’am. Thank you, Ma’am. Can I fondle your breasts,
Ma’am?”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I wasn’t nervous.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Admit it. You liked me. You were
interested.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I thought you were cute.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Cute? Do you believe this? I should have been
Picasso’s mistress. I should have been living in Barcelona or Paris. But
no, I’m moving in with a New York banker who thinks I’m cute.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I felt inspired.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: At 2:00 am?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You notice Carl’s eyes today? They were all
over you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me tell you
something. He’s not even looking at me. It’s you he idolizes. He doesn’t
see me at all… Anyway, he’s not my type.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I feel inspired.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The matter?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing… really.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You’re worried, aren’t you? About moving in
together?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Then what? The promotion?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. A lot of things. I just don’t
want the bubble to burst… Whenever something good happens to me I’m just
afraid I’m going to lose it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You know what?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I love you. I really love you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ditto.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh Jesus. Another one.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t watch that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>correspondent</strong>: …It is estimated that 34 people died
in the crash, the second in less than two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I should cancel my L.A. trip… These things
always happen in threes.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides, you lead a
charmed life.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah. So did they.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Amazing, huh? Just like that. Blackout.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A glitch. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: The Mark Greenberg and Larry White accounts. I
can’t get in. Your MAC code doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I changed it.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Why? What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nothing. I just want to nose around a bit… Can
you keep your mouth shut?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, sure. Tell me, what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think I’ve stumbled onto something. There’s
too much money in these accounts.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Too much money. That’s ridiculous. How could
there be too much money?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s what I keep asking myself.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It must be the computer.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve been checking.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah, Mr. Fixit. Come on, move over. Let me
see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not yet. I’m gonna dig around a bit.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Okay, okay. Just call me when you’re ready for
help. So, what are you and Moll doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’re going to the theatre. She wants to see
“Macbeth” at the Spring Street Repertory.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Did I tell you what Marcia said?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Six times.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Six? No I didn’t. Sam, don’t be so blas�.
I’ll have two major pieces in the show. The New York Times reviews her
gallery all the time. This could be huge.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, the “New York Times” is some frustrated
little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school. Who
cares what The New York Times thinks?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Eight million readers, that’s who.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Your work’s beautiful. That’s a fact, Moll. It
doesn’t matter what anyone thinks.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I want to marry you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I’ve been thinking about it for days. More
than thinking. I want to do it. I want to jump in whole hog… What is
that look for?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s just been so long since… I mean, you never
wanted to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Do you love me, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you think, Moll?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: How come you never say it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You say “ditto”. It’s not the same.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: People say “I love you” all the time. It
doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sometimes you need to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me handle this.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Your wallet!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Give it to him!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Take the money. Just leave the wallet and
my…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam, No!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This isn’t happening. It’s not happening.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do it! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly? Molly!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam? What’s the matter? Is something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What is it, honey?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What is it, honey?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s happening to me?!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t leave me. I need you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t stop! I’m not dead!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re new, huh? I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Relax. It ain’t like before, you know. It’s a
whole new ball-a-wax.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m waiting for my wife. She’s in 4C. Cardiac
wing. She’s fighting it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shot, huh? That’ll do it every time. Poor
bastard. Well, get used to it. You could be here a long time. I’ll tell
you a secret. Doors ain’t as bad as you think. Zip zap. They ain’t
nothin’ at all. You’ll see. You’ll catch on.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He ain’t gonna make it. I’ve seen it a million
times. He’s a goner. See? Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could have been
the other ones. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hurry, we’re losing him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’d I tell you? Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who are you? What’s happening…?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh God, help me.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: As we say farewell to our friend Sam
Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of
spirit…</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: All that we treasure, our friends, our
loved ones, our body, our mind, are but on loan to us. We must surrender
them all. We are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same
end.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: As our loved one enters eternal life, let
us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him,
our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: …and into Your hands we commend his
spirit. May he rest in peace. In the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: What time you going back to work?… What’s
the buzz on Digital? It’s sad. He was so young… How’s your new Honda?…
Going away this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh God, Sam…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I picked up your shirts this morning. I don’t
know why. Mr. Reynolds said to tell you hello. I broke into tears. It’s
so hard…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I think about you every minute. It’s like
you’re still here, like I can feel you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I am here, Moll. I am.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Frank, what’s wrong? Frank?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait, Moll. Not that one. That’s my
favorite…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Say something. Help her, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s hard. It’s very hard.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh good. That’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam’s address book.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Dave Brubeck. Newport ’86. Should I toss
’em?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, we hated that concert.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, you want to save those?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Rolaids? What are you doin’ Moll?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I miss him, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We all do.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Wait. Wait. Not that one.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh, shit. I’m sorry. I don’t know how that got
in there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, Moll. Why don’t you come? It’s like
summer outside.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just for a stroll. It’d be good to get
out.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I can’t do it Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly… you’re not the one who died!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Okay. Just a short walk.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Thata girl.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, Molly! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>the camera moves slowly through the loft and
gradually</strong>: DISCOVERS SAM. He is sitting in a corner singing
quietly to himself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. Drove my
Chevy to the levy, but the levy was dry. Them good ol’ boys were
drinkin’ whiskey and rye, and singing this’ll be the day that I…”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You motherfucking bastard! What the hell are
you doing here? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, no! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Frank, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Stay off! This is mine!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: She came home. I couldn’t get it. Give me a
couple of days. I’ll go back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Get what? Who the hell are you? What were you
doing at Molly’s? What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Stay away from her!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Sorry ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Rosa Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Please be seated.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: My sister will be with us soon.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of your
all-seeing presence. Appear for us now.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Mrs. Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Buenos dias.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I understand you are hoping to contact your
husband.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Si. Si.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Well, I believe he’s gonna be with us
today.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Oh, tsank you, tsank you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: But there’s no telling about the other
world. You gotta cast out all doubt. You gotta believe. Do you
believe?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Si. Si. I believe. I believe.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: And remember, we don’t make no promises. I
can phone up there till I’m blue in the face, …but it don’t necessarily
mean he’s gonna be home. Them folks go shopping, they play bingo. It’s
just like here. You can’t always get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sure lady!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Okay, let’s get ready then.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: We got a problem here. I don’t think he’s
in. Wait. I feel something. Did he know someone who’s passed over,
someone named Anna… Mary… Consuela… Maria?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Si, si! His mama. She’s Maria.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Ah! I knew it. He’s with his mama.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m afraid this is gonna be too hard. Now I
got two souls I gotta contact. I don’t know about that. It’s difficult,
you know. The pain. The effort.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: I pay more. How much? How much?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Way to go. Milk her for every penny.</p>
<p><strong>clara/louise</strong>: Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>clara/louise</strong>: Have mercy! Have mercy!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are fortunate
today. The channel is clear. Many spirits are gathering.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah? Where?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: My husband?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, he is
drawing toward us now. I can see him coming.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he
look?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oh, he is a very handsome man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Handsome?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: In our Father’s Kingdom we are all
handsome.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Julio!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He is standing before me. He is wearing a
black suit.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was
buried in that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What a crock of shit!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. santiago</strong>: Julio! Julio!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Get out of here! Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Keep him away!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you talking to me?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Do something. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t believe this. Hey you. My name is Sam
Wheat. Can you hear me? Sam Wheat!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam Wheat!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Samweet?</p>
<p><strong>clara/louise</strong>: Oda Mae! Oda Mae!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Lord, I swear, no more cheatin’. I promise,
Lord. I don’t want to go to hell. I’ll do anything. Gimme a penance.
Just make him go away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Go away. Hell no. I’m stayin’ right here!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: My mama, her mama, may they rest in peace,
they had de gift. Mama always said I had it, but I never did. She tol’
me all about it, how it felt an’ all. But now that it’s happenin’ I
don’t know what to do. You’re scarin’ me half to death. Please, you
gotta go away, you gotta find someone else.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Someone else? Are you outta your mind?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m gettin’ there fast. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not till you help me.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Where? I’m right here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m standing right beside you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: “I’m standing right beside you.” Are you
white?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oh God, I knew it. He’s white. Why me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen, damn it. You can help me. There’s a
woman, Molly Jensen. She’s in terrible danger. The man who killed me
broke into our apartment. He’s going to go back. You’ve gotta warn
her.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Why would she listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She has to! This man’s a killer! He’s got a
key.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Forget it, mister. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s just a phone call. You’re all I’ve got.
Lookit. I’m not leavin’ till you help me. I don’t sleep anymore, so I
can sit here day and night. I don’t care how long it takes. I can talk
forever.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Molly? Is this Molly speaking?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: My name is Oda Mae. I’m a spiritual reader
and adviser. I’m calling for a friend of yours. He asked me to call.
This is important. You gotta believe me. Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I got a message from Sam.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What’d I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You gotta go there.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Look, I don’t care what you do to me, I’m
not goin’ nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “I’m Henery the Eighth I am / Henery the Eighth
I am, I am / I’m gettin’ married to the widow next door / She’s been
married seven times before / And every one was an Henery / Wouldn’t take
a Willie or a Sam / I’m her eighth old man I’m Henery / Henery the
Eighth I am, I am / Henery the Eighth I am / Second verse same as the
first / I’m Henery the Eighth I am…”</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Okay! Okay! I’ll go. You just shut your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I can’t believe I’m doin’ this. I gotta be
a crazy lady goin’ into the city with you. I never go there. What the
hell you doin’ in my life, huh? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: There’s nobody there.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: No, sir. I did what I promised. I said I’d
come and I’m here. I didn’t say anything ‘bout waitin’.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just one more time. Please. It’s a big
place.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall,
ninety nine bottles of beer,”</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hello, who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Don’t go away. It’s Oda Mae Brown. I called
you last night. Your friend Sam says you gotta talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to me!
this is for real. Sam is here. He needs to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says remember the starfish at Montego
Bay? Remember the picture he took a’ you in Reno? Remember his green
underwear, the pair you wrote your name on? She wrote her name on
’em?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Hey, do you mind? This here’s a private
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ask her about the sweater in the closet, the
one she knitted that’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What about the sweater you knitted that was
too big?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Four sizes.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Four sizes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She couldn’t throw it out. I saw. I was
there.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You couldn’t throw it out. He saw. He was
there. This is for real. Hey do you hear me up there?</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: I hear you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m not talkin’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Haven’t you ever heard of phones?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Kiss my behind! Listen, I’m not gonna stand
here all day.</p>
<p><strong>workman</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Forget it. I’ve had enough of this.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Molly? I’m Oda Mae Brown. You can call me
Oda.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why should I believe you? Why should I
believe any of this?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Girl, if you think I’d come down here for
the fun of it, you got another think comin’. This Sam of yours… I don’t
know, lady. I mean, you ever hear a whole night of “Henry the Eighth I
am?”</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: He did that? That’s how he got me to go out
with him.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: And he cain’t carry a tune.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy. I can’t
believe I’m talking to you like this. I don’t believe in these things. I
don’t believe in life after death.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her she’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You’re talking to him right now?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What? You think I’m makin’ it up?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: How should I know? It’s not like I can see
him. I just hear his voice.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m holding her hand.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says he’s holding your hand.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t believe you. Why are you
doing this to me? I don’t believe a word you’re saying. Sam is dead.
He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m holding her hand.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says he’s holding your hand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: God, I love her. I love her so much.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says he loves you… so much.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No. He would never say that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ditto. Tell her “ditto”.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Ditto? What’s that mean, ditto?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: To tell the truth, I don’t know how I’m
doin’ it. In fack, confidentially, nothin’ like this never happened to
me before. Now, all a sudden, I can’t turn it off. Is this you? Is this
him?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they’d be
blue.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I don’t understand. Why did he come back? Why
is he still here?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Cause he’s stuck, that’s why. He’s between
worlds. It happens sometimes, when their spirits get out too quick. He
thinks he still has stuff t’do down here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oh, oh, now he’s got an attitude.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I do not have an attitude.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: We’re having a discussion. Whataya mean,
you’re not angry? If you weren’t angry you wouldn’t be raisin’ your
voice like that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Goddamn it, Oda Mae!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don’t talk to
anybody who takes the Lord’s name in vain.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Relax, Oda Mae.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You relax. You’re the dead one. You want my
help, then you apologize. Nobody talks to me like that, understand?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I don’t believe I’m watching this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Damn it. All right. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell Molly what
I’m saying. You gotta tell her word for word.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Monsieur has a message for you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, you’re in danger.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You can’t tell her like that. And would you
stop movin’ all over the place? You’re makin’ me sick.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He’s sayin’ you’re in danger.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Danger?… What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know the man who killed me. Willie Lopez. I
know where he lives.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says he knows the man who killed him,
Willie Lopez. He’s Puerto Rican.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Write it down.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Write it down.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You do it!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Now I’m a secretary.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: 321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: 321? Hey, that’s my neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, he’s got my wallet and my key. He was in
here.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He’s got his wallet and key. He was in
here.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: In here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You have to go to the police. The Mugger wasn’t
acting alone. It was a setup, Moll. I was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He says he was set up, that he was
murdered. He wants you to go to the police.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t want nothin’ to do with
this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Don’t follow me! I’ve done all I’m gonna
do. I’m finished. And I ain’t comin’ back. So don’t you come botherin’
me again cause it’s over. I mean it. This is it. Have a nice life. Have
a nice death. I’m goin’.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, there’s no one on earth who’d like it
to be true more than me, but you’ve got to be rational about this. I
understand your desire to hold on to him, but this… this is absurd.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It was real, Carl. She was real.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She needs some
support here.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, you’re a grown woman. How can you
believe some fortune teller from Brooklyn…?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: She was in touch with him.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t believe it, Molly. Not for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on, Carl. Open your mind.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl, she knew things.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I told you, the picture in Reno, the
starfish,… damn it, Carl. She said Sam knew who killed him. That he was
set up… murdered.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh boy. This is getting deranged. We’re going
off the deep end here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Give him the address, Moll.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: She had a name, an address – Willie Lopez,
321 Prospect Place. She said he had Sam’s wallet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This is sick. This is really sick. How can you
swallow this crap? Who knows if this guy exists? Maybe she’s just
setting someone up.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: That’s what I have to find out.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Find out? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam wants me to go to the police.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam wants you to go to the police? Molly!
Jesus! Are you outta your mind? What are you gonna tell ‘em? Some
storefront psychic’s been getting messages from the dead? Do you know
how that sounds? You’re talkin’ ghosts here, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry. This stuff just really gets to
me.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You don’t believe me. You don’t believe any
of this, do you?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m trying to, but… Look, if it’ll make you
sleep any better, I’ll check it out, okay? Now why don’t you go to bed.
Try and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Way to go, Carl!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Carl, what’re you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Who’ve you been talking to?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Talking to? What the hell do you mean?
What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Some woman knows all about you. The murder,
everything. Where’s she getting it from, huh?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What the hell are you talking about? I
haven’t said a word.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: She knows your name, goddamn it! She knows
where you live!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A lot of women know where I live.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This isn’t a joke, man. You find that bitch,
whoever she is, and… get rid of her, you hear me? I’ve got four million
dollars stuck in that fucking computer. If I don’t get those codes, if
that money’s not transferred soon, I’m dead. If I lose Balistrari’s
money, we’re both dead.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Tell him you only wash dirty money on the
first of the month.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What is wrong with you? Is everything a joke?
You were supposed to steal his wallet. You weren’t supposed to kill him.
Was that a joke?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I did you a favor. Freebee.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Jesus! These are drug dealers, man. Don’t blow
this for me, Willie. I’ve risked my job here. I could go to jail. A
hundred thousand of that money goes to me. Now give me Sam’s key. I’ll
get that address book myself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You killed me, Carl. You had me killed. Look
what you’ve done to me! Look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You fucker! You mother fucker! I had a life,
Goddamn you. I had a life!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You white fascist bigot. Who do you think you
are? Bed Stuy’s part of New York, you know. This is America.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin’?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Look, you’ve gotta believe me. I don’t even
believe this stuff, myself. But this is real. Do you think I’d come here
if it wasn’t real? You told me to come if I had any new information.
Well, here I am.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. You guys use
psychics all the time.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Damn it. I know how this sounds. I hear
myself saying it and I want to cringe. But this woman knew things she
couldn’t have known, intimate details.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: How intimate?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Things Sam only said to me.</p>
<p><strong>wallace</strong>: Okay, let me get this straight. According
to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place,
watching us all the time, huh?… I’m sorry. I’ve got important things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I’m telling you. The killer’s name is Willie
Lopez. I’ve got his address. You’ve got to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: Okay. You just wait here. Let me see
if this guy’s got a record.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What are you doing? Where’s your file on
Willie Lopez?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: There’s no file for a Willie Lopez.
He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with. This
psychic woman’s record goes back a long way. Fraud, numbers rackets, you
name it. She’s a real pro.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: 1967. Shreveport, Louisiana.
Forgery, selling false ID. Served one year. 1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested
for fraud, numbers racketeering. Served ten months. 1974. Hattiesburg,
Mississippi. Fraud, seven months. 1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny.
It goes on and on.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: This woman’s a charlatan. You can’t
believe anything she said.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: This isn’t possible. There were words,
private things. How could she have known all that?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: They have ways.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Ways? What ways?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: They’ve got a million cons. A lot of
times they read the obits. All she had to do was see the word “banker”.
Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use,
letters, old papers. They don’t need much.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It
could have been anything. What about that underwear she knew all
about?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: Green underwear. I’ll bet she zeroed
right in on that.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No! She was real. She said things. She knew
about a sweater I knitted, about songs we sang… She knew about this
place we went, Montego Bay…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. beiderman</strong>: I’m sorry. I know this is hard.
People want so much to believe. They’re grieving, vulnerable. They’d
give anything for one last moment… money, insurance policies. Believe
me, these people know what they’re doing. Look, I know how you must
feel. You know, you can press charges.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: God, let this be it!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh God, yes!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Tony, this is Carl. I’m all set. We’re fine.
Everything’s fine. Just tell me what you want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We want you to transfer the money from the 12
separate accounts into a single account under the name “Rita Miller”.
Tomorrow, at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer the full
account to First Island Bank of Nassau, registry number 486- 9580.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Call us when it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Tell Mr. Balistrari there won’t be any
problems.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why can’t you hear me, Molly? I need you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, it’s Carl. Can I come up?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t open it. He’s a murderer, Moll!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hi. Thanks. I know it’s late. I’m sorry to
disturb you. I felt bad about last night. This supernatural stuff just
makes me so uncomfortable. I don’t even read horoscopes.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Don’t worry. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No it’s not. You needed me to hear you and I
didn’t and that was wrong. I want you to know that I’m your friend,
Moll.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You were never our friend.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey, I brought you some Japanese apple pears.
I know you like them.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh, that’s so sweet.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Listen, can I come in for a minute? I won’t
stay long. I’ve had one of those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, Moll. Don’t do it. Don’t let him in!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Are you alright? You look nervous, upset.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What can I tell you. It’s been tough. Hell,
you know. It still hurts so much. Then on top of it all… it’s the
responsibilities. They’ve given me my own accounts, but I’ve had no time
to adjust. My mind has been reeling.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where were you this morning? I thought you
were coming to the bank to sign those papers.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I didn’t have time. I went to the police,
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re kidding. You really did it? I don’t
believe… What did you tell them? What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You were right, you know. I felt like such a
fool. They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. It
was awful.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A ripoff artist, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly, no.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: The sad part is that I believed her. I
believed her, Carl. It was all a sham.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sometimes we need to believe.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why?… I was a fool. I don’t believe anything
anymore. Why would people do such things?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold
facts of it. What you have to remember is the love you felt. That’s
what’s real. You have to remember how good Sam was. How much he loved
you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You were everything to him, Molly. You were
his life.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I feel so alone.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re not alone. You’re young. You’ve got so
much talent. You’re fantastically gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh God, I don’t know what’s real anymore. I
don’t know what to think.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just think about Sam. Think about what he
meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Let your feelings out.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Life turns on a dime, Moll. People think they
have forever, that they’ll always have tomorrow. But it’s not true. Sam
taught us that. We have to live for now, for today.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I can’t. I’m sorry. I can’t. It’s too soon…
You’ve been great Carl, but… I need you to leave. Please. I need you
to.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sure. It’s okay. I understand. I really
do.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night?
Just talk. Can I interest you in that?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Get off my train!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Teach me how you do that! I want to learn! I’m
not leaving til you teach me!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: You stubborn asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: What are you doing? What are you doing? You
can’t push it with your finger. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: It’s your mind, you idiot. It’s all in the
mind. The problem is you think you’re still real, that you’re standin’
on the floor, that you’re wearin’ those clothes. Bullshit! You don’t
even have a body anymore. It’s all up here. You wanna move things, you
gotta use your mind. You gotta focus! You hear what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How do you focus?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: I don’t know how you focus! You just
focus!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: It’s all in the anger. You gotta direct it.
You gotta channel it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m angry all the time. It doesn’t do a
thing.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Cause you’re angry all over. You gotta be
angry here, in the pit of your stomach. Bring it down here. Let it
explode. It’s like a reactor, you know. Pow!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I did it!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Way to go.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: From your gut. What do I keep tellin’
you?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Give it time! What else have you got?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Since they pushed me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Someone pushed you?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Yeah, someone pushed me!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: What? You don’t believe me? You think I fell?
You think I jumped? Well, fuck you! It wasn’t my time! I wasn’t supposed
to go! I’m not supposed to be here!</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: I’d give everything for a drag. Just one
drag.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Who the hell are you? Why are you hounding me
like this? Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is all this? What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What’d you do, tell every spook in town
about me? I got spooks from out of town here. There’s stuff goin’ on you
wouldn’t believe. I can’t hardly believe it myself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae. You’re doing it. This is for real. How
do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on. Look at this. You’re doing great.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: Can you hurry this up? My husband’s in the
waiting room.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I need your help, Oda Mae. There’s something we
need to do.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Forget it. I’m not doin’ anything. You’re
holdin’ on to a life that don’t want you no more. Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Give it up? I’m already dead.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Dead, yeah, but you ain’t finished dyin’.
Give up the ghost.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And how am I supposed to do that?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You’re asking me?</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Are you speaking to me?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Does it look like I’m speakin’ to you? So,
are you gonna leave or not? I’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What’s a matter? You’re supposed to be
concentrating. How do you expect me to do this if you’re not
concentrating? Okay then. You ready? Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin’ to me?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Ortisha?!</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Orlando! Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Ortisha, where are you? I can’t see too
good.</p>
<p><strong>relatives</strong>: Here! She’s here!</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: In front of you! I’m right here!</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: Mother of God, what’ve you done to your
hair!?</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Orlando, do you like it? It’s Autumn
Sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Get out of here, you little shit!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Lord oh Lord, don’t you ever do that to
me!</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Orlando!?</p>
<p><strong>orlando</strong>: What happened to me? I can barely move.</p>
<p><strong>ghost</strong>: You should know better than to try that. It’s
not worth it. It’ll wipe you out for days.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That was incredible, Oda Mae.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Never again. Never.</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Where’s Orlando?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He spoke through you. It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: No more, uh uh, no more.</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: What happened to Orlando? Where’d he leave
the insurance policy?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re great, Oda Mae! You’re a real medium.
It’s what you were born for.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I want everybody out.</p>
<p><strong>ortisha</strong>: Orlando?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Out! I said out! That means you, too!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Oda Mae, there’s a man here who says he has
to see you right away.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I ain’t seein’ nobody.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you the one that can talk to the
dead?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I beg your pardon! I’m not seeing customers
right now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I said I need to know if you’re the one.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m the one. But not now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: This is important. I have a friend. He died
recently. Some say he was mugged. I think he was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m told you can contact people like that.
Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: It’s been known to happen. But it’s not
gonna happen now, so come back later.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I can’t wait til later.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What’s your friend’s name?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Good question. Why don’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re the psychic, right?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: This ain’t no guessin’ game.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Then what is it, lady?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Lookit, I don’t know what your trouble is…
Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You’re the mindreader. I hear you’ve been
tellin’ people about me for days. What’s my name?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Willie!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Willie!?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Because I’m psychic.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He tried to kill me! Why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Talk to me!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae, we’re in trouble…</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: We’re in trouble? Who’s we? You’re already
dead.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can stop them. But I can’t do it alone.
You’ve gotta help me.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Help you? It’s me they’re tryin’ to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re right. And they’ll be back. I’m your
only chance.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Why don’t you go find a haunted house and
rattle some chains.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I need you Oda Mae. I need you to get some fake
ID’s.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Fake ID’s? What for?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Help me now, they’ll never bother you again. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Help you? Whataya talking about exactly?
What else do I have to do?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: This is crazy. This ain’t gonna work. I
don’t know nothin’ ‘bout bankin’.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ll teach you. You’ll learn fast.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: See where it says “New Accounts”? That’s where
you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m not givin’ ’em any money.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her you’re here to fill out a signature
card for a new account.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m here to fill out a signature card for a
new account.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: And do you know your account number?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes. 926-31043.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Yes. 926-31043.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Didn’t they have you sign a card when you

<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone
and asked you to come in today.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Carl Bruner opened it for me. He asked me
to come in today.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just sign you name at the bottom on the first
blank line.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, no, no. Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Can I have another one please? I signed the

<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her to see that it goes right up to the
third floor file since you have a transaction to make.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I need you to put that in the third floor
file cause I got a transfusion to make.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You know what I mean. Umm, can I keep the

<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hello. Carl Bruner speaking.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Carl?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Mr. Balsitrari</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Balistrari? Carl, it’s me, John. I’ve got the
info on the Bradley portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Oh yeah, yeah. That’s great. I’ll pick it up
later.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell the guard you’re here to see Lyle
Furgeson.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Lyle Furgeson, please.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: No. I’m here for the fun of it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t say that! Tell him Rita Miller’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Tell him Rita Miller’s here.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Just one moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t embellish.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now listen, this guy Furgeson’s a real
jerk.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Why are you whispering?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just be quiet and listen. I’ve known him five
years and he still thinks my name’s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s a social moron. You don’t have to worry
about anything. Tell the guard Furgeson knows you. You spent time with
him and his wife Shirley at the Brewster’s Christmas party last
year.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What is this regarding?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What? He doesn’t remember me? We were
together at the Brewster’s Christmas party. With his wife Shirley. They
had that lovely tree… all those presents. Why, I’ll never forget all
those beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oops. Gas.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This’ll be easy. Furgeson was so drunk at that
party, he could have had a conversation with Tina Turner and he wouldn’t
remember.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Hello, hello. Of course, of course. It’s
been so long.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: A long time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: How are Bobby and Snooky doin’?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Why, they’re just fine, thank you. Nice of
you to ask. And how is your… family?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Well, isn’t that wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell him you’ve been wondering how they did on
the Gibraltar securities.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: So tell me, Fergie, how did you do on the
Gibraltar securities?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: The Gibraltar securities! Well, it looks
like we topped out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “We sure did!”</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: We sure did.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: That was a wonderful tip.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Good old Randy”.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Good old Randy. Got a real head on his
shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Her” shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: “Her” shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Sure does. Well… well. So what brings you
here today?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re closing an account.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I’m closing an account.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Well… wonderful. Do you have your account
number?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: 926-31043.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: 926-3143.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: 31-0-43.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Make that 31-0-43… Numbers. I’m
dyslexic.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Well, Rita, you’ll be withdrawing four
million dollars from us today, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Four million dollars?!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Say “yes”!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Yes! Four million. That’s right. That’s
right.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: And how will you want that?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Tens and twenties?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A cashier’s check! Tell him a cashier’s
check.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: A cashier’s check.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Fine. Of course, you realize we’re
required to get some identification from everyone. It’s just procedural.
You understand.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: You know, if you put that Brillo pad in the
freezer, it’ll last twice as long.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Yes, Mr. Bruner.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Get me the First Island Bank of Nassau. It’s
on the rolodex.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: I’ll just need your signature right
here.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sign Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute. You’re on your own.
Don’t say anything foolish.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Now you be careful with this. It’s like
carrying cash, you know.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I sure do.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Then my mother took all the money from the
oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps. Every gas station has ’em you
know, sometimes six or more. It adds up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out of here. Say
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Well, I’ve got to leave. It’s been a
pleasure doin’ business with you. Say “hi” to Shirley and Snooky for
me.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Thank you, Rita. I’ll be glad to.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hurry up, Oda Mae.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What a day!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Lionel?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Molly. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Lionel, a woman who just left, a black lady,
about my height, did you see her?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Well, yes. I just took care of her.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What did she want? Did it have anything to do
with me? Did she ask about Sam?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Sam? No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Was her name Oda Mae Brown?</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: No, Rita Miller. She just closed an
account.</p>
<p><strong>furgeson</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No. I guess not. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>leeden</strong>: Carl, is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Is someone playing with the computers?</p>
<p><strong>leeden</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Is this a joke? One of my accounts is
closed.</p>
<p><strong>leeden</strong>: Which account? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>leeden</strong>: You want me to call someone?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No, no. Never mind. It’s okay. It’s all right.
I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: $4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae. Take the check out of your purse.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Take it out? Why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Endorse it? Why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s blood money, Oda. I was killed for that
money. Endorse it now.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We’re giving it away.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Away? What do you mean? To who?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look to your left.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Are you outta your mind?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: No! I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, you can. If you don’t do it, they’ll track
you down. Your only protection is to get rid of it, now.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sweet Jesus, you’re killing me, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m saving you, Oda Mae. You’ll go to heaven
for this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Write “St. Joseph’s Shelter”.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Bless you, child.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Don’t you talk to me. I don’t want you
comin’ round no more. I mean it. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come on, we’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Friends? Friends?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think you’re wonderful, Oda Mae.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Search, you bastard! You’ll never find it. It’s
gone. They’ll kill you for this, Carl. You and Willie. They’ll wipe you
off the face of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Who’s doing that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You bastard! You goddamn bastard!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s dinner time, Carl. Don’t you have a date
with Molly, you creepy son-of-a bitch?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Jesus! Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl? Where were you? I thought we were
having…?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m sorry. Things just got so crazy. I
completely forgot.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Old Carl had a little trouble at the
office.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Forgot? I was worried. Is everything okay?
Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’m okay. I’m alright. Look, can I talk to you
for minute? Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I need to ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He needs to borrow four million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, I know what the police said, but when
you thought Sam was here, when you thought he spoke to you, what did you
feel? What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, that psychic woman, I want to know what
she told you. I want to know what she said.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax. I told
you. It wasn’t real. She’s a charlatan. Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: At the bank?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says she was
taking out money. It turns out her name isn’t even Oda Mae Brown. It’s
Rita Miller or something.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Stomach. My stomach. Do you have anything?
Pepto Bismol.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sure. Just a second. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What are you doing to me. Get away! Get
away!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You touch me again and I’ll set her on fire. I
mean it. I’ll kill her. I’ll blow up the whole building if I have to.
Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go on, try it again. Let me see you turn it
off now.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Try and hurt me. I’ll kill her if you hurt
me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: What’s a matter? You believe me, huh? You
better believe me! I want my money. I need that money and I want it
tonight – at 11:00. If that psychic lady doesn’t bring it here, Molly’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh my God. Is that the gas?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You must have left the stove on.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Just glad I smelled it.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, I’m sorry. I’ve got to go. Look,
there’s something going on. I can’t talk now. Some trouble at the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it that
woman, the psychic?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I don’t have time to talk now. What if I come
back? Around 11:00?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl, what’s going on? Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I can’t. I’m sorry to do this, but it’s
important. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Eleven!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: Not again!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What’re you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oda Mae! We’re in trouble. They want the check.
They’re comin’ to kill you. We gotta get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: The check? What do you mean, “the check”.
You said they’d never find out.</p>
<p><strong>clara</strong>: What’s happenin’ Oda Mae?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s them.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: They’re comin’ to kill me. What have you
done?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They’re heading for the door.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Jesus have mercy.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Emergency! Let us in!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Who you kiddin’?</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: What’re you doin’? You can’t come in
here. The cat don’t like visitors. She’ll pee all over the couch. You
wanna pay for…</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: They’re gonna find us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No they won’t. I’m gonna get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whataya mean? I’m a ghost, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Looks like someone just left.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll check the building.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who’s there? Who’s doing that?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Let me outta here!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s dead, Oda Mae.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Dead! Oh, thank God. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. It’s not over, Oda Mae. There’s still
Carl.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Who’s Carl?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell him to hurry!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Can’t you hurry up?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Listen, lady, I’m going as fast as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Problems?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Carl, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Molly, it’s Oda Mae. I know what you think
of me, but your life is in danger. You have to listen to me. Sam’s here,
too. You gotta let us in.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Get the hell out of here. I’m calling the
police.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Go ahead. We want you to call ’em. You’re
in trouble. Let us in.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam’s death was no accident. He was
murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering money at the bank. Sam found out.
He’s dangerous. He tried to kill me. He’ll kill you, too.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Why are you doing this to me? Get away from
me! I know all about you. You’re a fake. You’re just a fake. Leave me
alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her she’s wearing the blouse I spilled the
Margarita on and the earrings I gave her for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam says you’re wearin’ the blouse he
spilled the Margarita on and the earrings he gave you at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: See, I’m no fake.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Go away!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gimme a penny quick.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Push a penny under the door.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell her it’s for luck.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Sam says it’s for luck.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Right. Yes, it’s right on the corner. We’re a
red brick building with the entrance on the left side. Please hurry.
Thank you Sergeant. We’ll be waiting right here. Police are on their
way.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Is Sam here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sitting beside you.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Can you feel me, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: With all my heart.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: With all his heart, he says.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d give anything to be alive again, just to
feel you once more.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: He wishes he could touch you, just one more
time.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Okay, damn it, you can use me if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Come on. Before I change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I love you so much.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: The police!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly, open up. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s Carl!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Get out of here! The fire escape.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly. Open up. Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Molly!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Back to the fire escape. Head for the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Help us, Sam!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I want the check. Just give me the check.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: God almighty, Carl! What are you doing? What
have you done!?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t interfere! She’s a thief. It’s not her
money.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Keep out of this, Molly!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: In my purse.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Where is it, goddamn it? Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: I gave it away.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You’re lying! Don’t lie to me!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I’ll kill her. You touch me and I’ll kill her.
I mean it, Sam. Just give me the check.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam, please. I didn’t mean for him to kill
you. It’s not my fault. Come on, Sam, give me the check. Give it to me
and I’ll leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam? Sam?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Goodbye, Moll.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Sam? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Molly?!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I hear you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can’t stay anymore.</p>
<p><strong>oda mae</strong>: They’re waiting for you, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. Thank you. Your mama
would be proud.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I love you, Molly. I’ve always loved you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Ditto.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s so amazing, Moll…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The love inside.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: See ya.</p>
