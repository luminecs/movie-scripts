<h1 id="nothing-but-a-man">nothing-but-a-man</h1>
<p><strong>int. bunk car</strong>: The dormitory of the section gang.
The men are through for the day and lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF
ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using bottle tops as pieces. Duff
makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted, turns over the board. He
saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken mirror. Frankie
watches him with a grin.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Go to hell, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Man, you sure one ugly cat!</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Why don’t you guys buy your own?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: ’Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: How much longer we got on this stretch,
Riddick?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Five weeks, maybe six.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Man, what a dump.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What you gettin’ all pretty for?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Why don’t you relax, Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>railroad track</strong>: Duff, Frankie, and Jocko are riding
a track-car, powered by a small engine, into the nearest town. The sun
is setting. A church bell rings.</p>
<p><strong>pool hall</strong>: Jocko, a cigar in his mouth, is playing a
pinball machine. Duff and Frankie stand at the bar. They are joined by
DORIS , a sad-looking woman with bad skin.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Who’s going to buy me a beer?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What’s the matter, Doris? Business bad?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: It sure is.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Everybody givin’ it away free, huh?</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: See Duff. He’s the money man.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: What d’you say, Duff?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Give her a beer.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Thanks, Duff. You’ a nice guy. Not like
Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: You know, Doris - you’d make some guy a
swell wife.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You think so, Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Hell, you got steady work.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Quit ridin’ her, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: I ain’t ridin’ her. Wouldn’t ride her on a
bet.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Where’ you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Want me to come?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Come on, honey.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Where’ you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: ’Round town.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: What’s so hot ’round town?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Take it easy, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Don’t wanna fish you outa no jailhouse.</p>
<p><strong>int. church</strong>: The choir is singing “Precious Lord.”
The women are spirited and the congregation in the small wooden building
is alive to the music.</p>
<p><strong>reverend</strong>: I’m glad to see this meeting off to a good
start. Now we’ll take a break and then come back to hear from our
distinguished guest - Reverend Butler of the Morgan Street Baptist
Church in Birmingham. See you all in a little while.</p>
<p><strong>church yard</strong>: Long tables laden with food are lit by
strings of lightbulbs. The sound of a gospel piano from inside the
church.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Josie - this is Brother Anderson. Now you
give him some of that good food. He’s a fine young man. Ain’t it a
wonderful meetin’?!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Thank you, Ma’am. That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You must be new in town.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I’ll have me some of that punch there,
too.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Haven’t seen you around, have I?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No. I’m new in town.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You working?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah. On the section gang.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You work around town?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Went to college, huh?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: In Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah? That’s my home town.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Your folks live there?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No. My mother’s dead. You goin’ back
inside?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Yes, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You
goin’?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: My father’s the preacher.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Look, I don’t know what you been told ‘bout
section gangs, but how ’bout seein’ me sometime?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>int. church</strong>: The visiting revival preacher is in
full swing, preaching and singing. The congregation of women is in a
state of high excitement. Josie alone seems out of it, though she sits
in their midst.</p>
<p><strong>ext. church</strong>: Duff walks away, past a shack. The
singing fades. A dog barks.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: You got a lousy hand, Frankie.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Yeah, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You got nothin’ on your mind but your hair,
Frankie. How ’bout your car, Riddick?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Yeah, you can have it.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Man, you won’t like that back seat.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Man, why ‘you messin’ around with a gal
like that? You won’t get no place.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Hell, they’re all after the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your
money.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: What d’you know about women, Pop?</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Well, I got married to one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Hell, I didn’t know you was married.</p>
<p><strong>pop</strong>: Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Is that right? Think you’re gonna make it
with her?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Just get her drunk.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How ’bout the key?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: I bet she’s easy jam.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dawson</strong>: I know you pay no mind to my feelings,
but d’you think it’s right for you to go out with him?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m twenty-six years old, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dawson</strong>: Perhaps you ought to tell her,
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Well, we have a position in town,
Josie. You have to remember that. There’re lots of other young men.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dawson</strong>: I don’t think your mother would have
approved.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. dawson</strong>: Well, there’s just one thing you can be
looking for in a man like that.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I know that’s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Hush your mouth, child.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Good night, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>road house</strong>: On the dimly lit, smoke-hung floor a
large crowd is dancing. Josie is having a great time. When the music
ends, she and Duff return to their table.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’s pretty good for a preacher’s
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What d’you expect?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You know, baby, I can’t figure you out.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Why d’you come out with me? You slummin’ or
something?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: So what you doin’ with a cat like me in a
joint like this?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You don’t think much of yourself, do you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, that’s a funny thing to say.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You keep asking me why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah, and you keep not answerin’, too.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I like a place with lots of life.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How about another beer?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Go on - you can have one!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Well, if it ain’t Duff!</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: How you doin’? Hi there!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Mind if we sit down?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: We was just leavin’, fellows.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: Let’s go, Jocko. The man’s got
homework.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: See you, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah, see you in hell.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: They must work on the section gang.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, they seem just like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.</p>
<p><strong>frankie’s voice</strong>: We do!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Come on, baby.</p>
<p><strong>frankie</strong>: School teacher! My nappy head!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I guess it’s hard working on the road like
that.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a
week.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I mean, you’re kind of cut off, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’s fine with me. Keeps me out of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: How d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, I don’t get on so well most places.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I see. That beer made me dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You got a lovely face, kid. Ain’t too often I
get to meet a girl like you. Hell–</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Baby, how many times’ you been kissed?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, let’s see now - not counting tonight …
must be about twenty-eight times.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You got a problem all right.</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: They doin’ anything?</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Nah, nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Don’t Duff–</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Relax, man!</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Cut that out!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I said: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>white</strong>: Don’t start no trouble, boy!</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: Let’s go! That’s the preacher’s girl.
Mess with him and you got old man Johnson on your back. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Let’s go, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Don’t sound human, do they?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How come you stay ’round here?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, my mother was the only good teacher the
colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’s why you come back, huh?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s hard to see any change. But I’m going to
stay. Another year, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You got more guts than me, baby. It’s a
no-good town.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s better than it used to be. Eight years
ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged
him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Scared, huh?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, good night, baby.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Not here, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a
shot-gun right now.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: But I would like to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I
wouldn’t go ‘round stickin’ out my jugular vein.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You almost got into trouble back there.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I wouldn’t have let you.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell, baby, I’m not in the third grade. Well,
look - what’ we gonna do next time – have a nice long chat in the
parlor?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No, on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah, and then what?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, either we’re gonna hit the hay or get
married. Now you don’t want to hit the hay, and I don’ want to get
married.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You have some very primitive ideas, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: All right, so I’m primitive. So what d’you
want with me?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they’re
kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you’re
different. That’s why I went out with you. I thought we might have
something to say to each other.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell, baby, I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Good night, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>open field</strong>: The section hands are hunting rabbits,
scaring them up out of the tall grass and then clubbing them with sticks
that have a heavy bolt fastened to the end.</p>
<p><strong>classroom</strong>: The grade school children, all black, are
writing at their desks.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Are you finished, Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yes, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Well, I’m not. Wait till class is
dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: All right. Class dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. schoolhouse</strong>: A bus crowded with noisy kids
pulls away to reveal the yard. Duff and Josie are sitting on two swings
side by side.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a
long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn’t
come back.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Why did you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I don’t know. ’Guess I belong here more than
there.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: ’Been up north?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months
after the Army. You been there?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, it ain’t that good up there neither.
Might as well make it here. ‘Course I ain’t really makin’ it now.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Anyway, they can’t get to you if you keep
movin’!</p>
<p><strong>front yard, dawson house</strong>: It is raining. Duff and
Josie dash up the path to the front door.</p>
<p><strong>dawson parlor</strong>: Duff and Josie barge in out of the
rain and find themselves face to face with Reverend Dawson and a
middle-aged white man - Superintendent Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Come on in, Josie. We’re all through.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Daddy - this is Duff Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: All right, son.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: This is Mr. Johnson, our school
superintendent.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: So you’re courtin’ the preacher’s girl.
Well, just watch your step, boy, or he’ll preach you right into hell.
I’m counting on you, Reverend.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: Wouldn’t do for one of your people to sue
at a time like this.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>johnson</strong>: I’ll talk to the Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: That’ll make the folks very
happy.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: It’s hard to know how to talk to
the white folks these days.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Guess it’s never been easy.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: It’s a changing time. Sit down,
son.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Well, it looks like we’ll be
getting our new school.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How come you all ain’t sendin’ them to the
same school?</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Well, you’ve got to go easy. We
haven’t had any trouble in town for eight years, and we’re not going to
have any now.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Can’t live without trouble, can you? Nice
place you got here. Real nice.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Yes, the Lord’s been pretty good to
us. I guess you’re a church man, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I guess I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Why? Don’t you believe in the
Lord?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Aw, I do. But ‘seems to me us colored folks do
a whole lot of church-goin’. It’s the whites that need it real bad.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I think if you tried livin’ in a
town like this, instead of running free and easy, you’d soon change your
tune.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I see. Well, I guess we don’t have
much to say to each other.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: And since we’re talking, my wife
and I don’t want you hanging around our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, that figures. Kind of fits in with
everything else, don’t it!</p>
<p><strong>dawson porch</strong>: Duff comes out. Josie joins him a
moment later.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Ain’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: That’s the way he is.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah. It’s just like I figured.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell, I don’t belong here. I don’t know what
I’ been thinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Look, Duff - if you’re free, I’m not working
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Sorry, baby. I’m goin’ to Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Just for the day?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Goin’ to see my kid.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I didn’t know you had one.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah. Well, I do.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No, I ain’t married. Well, good-bye.</p>

<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Look, boy, we got a smooth operation
here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you’re plannin’

<p><strong>duff</strong>: What d’you think?</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Then do like I said. Men - this boy
here’s got something to tell you-all. Well, how about it?</p>

<p><strong>josie</strong>: They won’t.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I’m telling you, baby, maybe we better get out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: We can always do that, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I know. I’m not really thinkin’

<p><strong>duff</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Cup of coffee. I ‘been meanin’ to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You know, over at the mill, there’s just one
guy that talked. It’s kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted
different.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Been over to the other mill?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah, I been there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It’s just that we’re not used to seein’ anyone
stand up ’round here. Kinda took us by surprise.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah? That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>int. pool hall</strong>: Duff is at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Well, if you tried the mills, there ain’t
no other industry ’round here.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How ’bout that furniture plant?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Man, the darkest thing they got in there
is Coca-Cola.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Now, if you want to work like a real
nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: They done that too long in my family.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: They pay you three bucks a day an’ all
the cotton you can eat.</p>

<p><strong>woman</strong>: I got enough.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: I got a good buy on soap. You go on over
there an’ take a look! Right over there.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I’m lookin’ for work.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: I got a boy. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>int. duff’s car</strong>: He is driving through town at a
fast clip. The car rattles.</p>
<p><strong>int. beauty parlor</strong>: The staff and clientele are
black.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Don’t ask, baby - huh! How much money you got
with you?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: About ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Water pump’s busted. I don’t know if it’s
worth fixin’, but I need that car.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You can have what I’ve got. It’s right
there.</p>
<p><strong>flat bed truck</strong>: It rattles over a country road
between cotton fields. Duff stands among the field hands on the open
flatbed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cotton gin</strong>: The white foreman is up on the
loading platform. He addresses a group of field hands looking for
work.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Startin’ tomorrow mornin’, we got work for
fifteen hands. All we’re gonna pay is two-fifty a day. Can’t pay you the
three ’cause ain’t gonna be much of a crop this year. Now you all who
want to work, step up and we’ll take your name.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: It’s not as hard on a girl. They’re not
afraid of us.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You know - we do have enough money.
Especially now.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Sure, baby. ’Fact, I don’t ever have to work
no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to
school. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I’m trying to help, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I could work even after the baby comes. A few
hours a week, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: What the hell could you do?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Day work.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: ‘You kiddin’? You ain’t goin’ to no white
home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No point fixin’ it!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What’re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Good kindlin’!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: What’s bitin’ you now!?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You heard me!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I can’t stand to see you like that. I know
you can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Stop bein’ so damn understandin’.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I know just how you feel, son. But
believe me, you’re going about it the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Don’t look like there’s a right way.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Well, you have to be reasonable.
Now they say you’re a troublemaker. That’s no good. Use a little
psychology. Make ’em think you’re going along - and get what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: It ain’t in me.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: You’ll be in trouble, son. Now just
how do you intend to support your family?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I guess I’ll rob a bank.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Don’t you get smart with me,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>kitchen</strong>: Josie is on the floor, picking up pieces of
broken glass.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Maybe you ought to move. You’d be a
lot better off in the North.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: So I been told.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: It’s for your own good.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah? Seems to me, Reverend, you’ more
concerned ‘bout your good. Guess it looks kind ’a bad, havin’ me for a
son-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: You can be cocky now, boy. But you
won’t make it. You won’t last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it
wouldn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, at least she ain’t married to no white
man’s nigger! You been stoopin’ so long, Reverend, you don’t even know
how to stand straight no more. You’ just half a man!</p>
<p><strong>kitchen</strong>: Josie has cut her finger on the glass. She
is weeping silently.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: Reverend Dawson turns to leave. His
sense of calm superiority is shattered.</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He
might have a job for you at his filling station.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>reverend dawson</strong>: I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: ’Bye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: How come you don’t hate their guts?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I’m not afraid of
them.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You were plenty scared that night in the
car.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Just of getting hurt. They can’t touch me
inside.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Like hell they can’t. They can reach right in
with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Not if you see them for what they are,
Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Jesus, baby, you’re so full of talk! Well, you
ain’t never really been a nigger, have you - livin’ like that in your
father’s house! So just shut your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’s two bucks, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why don’t you come over for a beer when you get
through?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Okay, I will.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Hey, Duff! Run the truck down Holly Road.
There’s a guy in the ditch.</p>
<p><strong>country road</strong>: The owner comes toward him
eagerly.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Sure glad to see you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Guess I was kinda lucky, huh? My wife’s going
to give me hell.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: How you doin’, boy?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Want me to hold the light for you?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Just tryin’ to be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Most folks around here got no use for
nigrahs. Got to understand them, that’s all. How you doin’, boy?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Seems a little loose!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: She’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: She ain’t comin’ up even!</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Jesus, I told you to watch it!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: That’s the trouble with you boys! Don’t
listen when a man tells you something.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: She don’t look no worse to me.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Don’t do her no good to get banged like
that.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Don’t do her no good to go into a tree.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: What did you say, boy?!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I said, she’s in great shape.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: I heard you! Now ‘stead of bein’ smart, you
just get that car out of here!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Like some service from that boy there. Like
the way he takes care of us.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Fill her up?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas.
And watch you don’t make it thirty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Didn’t hear you say “Yessir!” Don’t they say
“Yessir” where you come from?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Boy - you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’ll be thirty-eight cents.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you’re
white! Who d’you think you are - king of Harlem?</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: How ’bout this windshield, boy? Like a
little service.</p>
<p><strong>third white</strong>: Hell, they’re getting’ too big for
their britches.</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: Yeah, his wife’s the same way,
struttin’ through town like she owns the place - shakin’ that little
rear end.</p>
<p><strong>third white</strong>: It’s all that education they’re
getting.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Real cool, ain’t he! Just like we’re not
here.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That’ll be thirty-eight cents.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You in a big hurry, boy?</p>
<p><strong>second white</strong>: Yeah, he’s tryin’ to get home!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Bet she’s pretty hot, huh?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You watch your mouth, man!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I bet she’s a sly little nigger, that girl.
Wouldn’t mind a piece of her myself!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: All right, you get out of here, man!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Who’re you tellin’ to get, boy?! You watch
it, or there’ll be some dyin’ done ’round here!</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: That dyin’s gonna be done two ways.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Let’s go, Al. He ain’t worth it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Now you stay out of it!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You better get rid of this white-eyed
nigger!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Never mind! You keep him workin’ here and
this place won’t be around. And I ain’t kiddin’!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Guess we got trouble.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You ain’t got none, Mister!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I’m sorry, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Don’t tell me. I know.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I called the gas station. I’ve been
worried.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Hell, if they don’t blow up his place, they’ll
get him some other way. Don’t make no difference no-how.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: What d’you mean?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Nothin. Quit lookin’ at me like that!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Duff, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, that don’t do me one bit of good!</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Come on, Duff - let’s go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: I never should have married you in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Ain’t you goin’ to say something?</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: There’s nothing to say.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: Well, that’ll be the first time.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: Where’re you going to go?</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: When I get set, I’ll send for you.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: I don’t think that’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You’ll be better off without me. I ain’t fit
to live with no more. It’s just like a lynchin’. Maybe they don’t use a
knife on you, but they got other ways.</p>
<p><strong>josie</strong>: You’re not a man because of a job, Duff.</p>
<p><strong>duff</strong>: You don’ know nothin’ ‘bout it, baby. Nothin’!
And don’t kid yourself - you did your bit.</p>
