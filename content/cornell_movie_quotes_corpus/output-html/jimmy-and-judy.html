<h1 id="jimmy-and-judy">jimmy-and-judy</h1>
<p><strong>camera operator</strong>: Oh, mmph.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing the nasty
last night. Thanks for that one. By the way, who the fuck is Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey Dad, Mom’s on the phone telling her
friends that you’re hung like a light switch.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes the reach
and… yes! Both balls at the same time! One heck of a double play!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And the sniff to finish it off.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fucking freak show.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you like that nigger? Come on nigger, do
you like it?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Oh yeah baby, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, so. What was going through your mind
when I called you a nigger?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: This costs you an extra fifty.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, what did it feel like?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: It felt like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: You ain’t the first person to call me a
nigger when we was fucking.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Johns call me nigger all the time.
Especially white guys. Nothing new. Just dirty talk.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: That it?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: What about you? You like calling me
nigger? You get your nut off?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Then why’d ya call me that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Have you ever wondered what it was like to
treat someone so completely cruel that it was unthinkable?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was trying to do the unthinkable and
unimaginable when I called you that. I wanted to see if was even
possible for me to do that.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think I want to die. Like I don’t deserve
to live anymore. And that I will never want to do something like that to
someone again.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Why ya wanna die?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Because everyone hates me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They hate me because I seek beauty and
appreciate destruction. They hate my mind, my thoughts, my imagination.
They hate everything about me. And I hate them.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yep. Everyone. Everyone that knows or who has
ever met me.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: Your parents don’t hate you. Look at
this room in this big ’ole house you got.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: My parents provide me with food and shelter
because they have been conditioned by society into thinking it’s the
appropriate thing to do. In reality they can’t stand to be in the same
room with me. They’re fascists, brainwashed, and unforgiving.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: You wanna know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, I really do.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: I think you’re a spoiled ass white boy,
thinks you everything, but you don’t know shit. All you do is bullshit
complain and there’s folks out there that’d kill for all this.</p>
<p><strong>prostitute</strong>: I don’t feel sorry for you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No one is asking you to. Thank you for
letting me film you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: So Melissa talked Gary into the SL
instead of the seven series. I couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: They paid way too much.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s dad</strong>: I strictly buy American anyway.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s mom</strong>: Where you going honey?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Can we start already?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: One second.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who do you hate most in the world and
why?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why? Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: God, I just wanted to come up here to say “hi”
and get away from my parents’ bullshit for like two seconds and you have
to put the stupid camera in my face.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now we’re onto something.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re weird Jimmy. You were weird when we
were kids and now you’re just getting weirder.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is that why you had a crush on me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah right.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You didn’t have a crush on me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re a loser. You’re twenty one and you’re
still living with your parents.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I heard that you got kicked out of college
because you tried to talk your roommate into killing himself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: From everyone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You wanna know the truth?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He asked me if he should kill himself. I told
him to look inside himself for the answer. I didn’t tell him to. I
didn’t tell him not to. I said he shouldn’t be afraid of the unknown. If
he was going to kill himself, I wanted him to do it for the right
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I swear to God, you’re a fucking psycho.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Like you’re normal.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: More than you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If I’m such a freak, what are you doing in my
room?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I was bored.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I wanna show you something?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t believe I’m doing this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Can you start the tape?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t think this means I like you or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And as soon as this is over I’m going back
downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s Mrs. Holzclaw’s car. She’s your P.E.
teacher, right? I hated her too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And Bill McAllister… I went to school with
his brother. They’re both dicks.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I planted an ounce of weed in his locker then
sent an anonymous letter to Principal Lipsky.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I took care of her too.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I had to.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I did it for you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Please tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I felt like if I didn’t save you then no one
else would.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Jimmy! What the hell are you guys doing
up there?</p>
<p><strong>female party guest #1</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, great party, huh? I’m making a tape for
my parents. Want to say something to them?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey Mom. Happy anniversary. You want to say
anything to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Get out! Now!</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Jimmy, we discussed this. You can’t
tape our sessions. It’s not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: You know, you can’t film someone who
doesn’t want their image and voice recorded. Technically, you’re
actually breaking the law.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Does your defiance make you feel more
powerful?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Filming people makes you feel like
you’re in control of the situation doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: I can sit here as long as you can.
You’re not going to be able to force me to participate in your little
game here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Jimmy, this isn’t something that
friends do to each other is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Jimmy, put the camera away, please.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: You’re wasting your time and mine,
Jimmy. We could be doing something productive.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Put it away.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Now Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Come on Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>dr. walters</strong>: Gimme the Goddamn fucking camera!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. No filming. I’m leaving, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, okay. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Say what you said to me before.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know how I said it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Paraphrase it then.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Say it like you did before but it doesn’t
have to be exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You mean paraphrase it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I didn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Tell me when.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You want me to paraphrase it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t remember what I said.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Then just ad-lib.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Ad-lib?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It means make it up.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you want me to make something up or
paraphrase what I did the first time?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s take a break.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m not good on camera. It makes me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Forget about the camera. Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me what you said earlier. About me about
how you felt when you saw the video.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It felt like someone had been reading my
mind.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It was like someone had jumped into my head
and watched what was being projected.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And earlier, what you said about God.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I said that it felt like God had sent someone
to protect me, and to look out for me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And I said that you are the only person in my
life who has ever looked after me like that.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: God, I hate it when you film me crying!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How do you like it, huh? How do you like
having a camera shoved right up your ass?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you like it? Do you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t like it or dislike. I’m used to
it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Generally I’d place the camera further away
from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then I guess
I’ll have to adjust to it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How’s this work for you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So… why do you have to film everything?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t film everything.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why do you like to film me crying?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Then why do you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Because it’s rare that I get to find someone
that lets their emotions go. When a person is crying, I mean truly
crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. For a few
seconds or minutes I get a chance to see that person’s soul. And really,
now that you’ve forced me to think about it. I think it’s a very rare
and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Because.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why you and why me? Why are we together right
now?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Go ahead say it. I want you to. I know what
you’re going to say so just say it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Because we’re both fucking weird!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Because we’re the two weirdest kids in the
world. And God made us for each other and I fucking love you, and you
did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything
that doesn’t get it!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s right, right?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: To a beautiful place.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Chuck E. Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I can’t tell you. It’ll ruin it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy, can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you hate your parents?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, but I understand them.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What’s to understand?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I understand that my ascension into young
adulthood triggered their descent into mid-life crisis. Generally when
an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own
lives. They see us as a younger, better version of themselves.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How do you know all these things?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: When you don’t have any friends, don’t play
sports, don’t go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to
listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have
to figure things out by yourself. And without any of those things I have
nothing but time to think about stuff.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You are SO smart.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You are so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You think I’m pretty?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think you’re the most beautiful person I
have ever met. The most beautiful person in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No one has ever told me that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get used to hearing it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you think I’m smart?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you think I’m fat?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How could you say that? I only way a hundred
and ten pounds.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. I thought you said flat. As in
flat chested.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I am not FLAT!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t have to prove it. Here look.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I still can’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I wear a full B cup.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Show me. Take em out.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I am not going to take them out! You take
yours out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s already out.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t believe you did that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s why I did it. Now come on. I showed
you mine, let me see yours.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow. Give me the camera.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please, pretty, pretty please with sugar on
top.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here, I’ll pull over.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let me see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That doesn’t count. Come on, for real this
time.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t be. You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You can. You can trust me with your life.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Will you take off your bra?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I just realized something.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I just showed you my breasts and I saw your
penis and we haven’t even kissed.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You haven’t even asked me to be your
girlfriend and I did that. I’m a slut. I don’t want to be a slut.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Will you be my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I kiss you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. Will you turn off the camera?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I want this moment to be captured forever.
I’d rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document
the most beautiful moment of my life.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I wanna see your smiley face again.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Turn the camera off. Turn the camera off. Turn
it off.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Relaxed, happy, confident, studly, excited,
relieved, delighted… I love you Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Very much so. I always have.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you want to pull over again?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you getting this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on. Are you getting this?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This is where you wanted to take me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I wanna go home.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t fuck this up. Please don’t fuck this
up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just try to be normal. Just be normal! God
damn it why do you have to fuck everything up?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Be normal. Be normal. Be normal!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So how do you feel now, right at this
moment?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know. That was soooo good.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You were good. What got into you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve just really been wanting
you lately. Really bad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m embarrassed. I can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now you have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It was after yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah, it was after I saw you shoot that
gun.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You were crying. I wanted to kill myself
after I did that. You were scared and you were shaking. It was the most
awful thing I ever did. I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I was scared at first. Really scared. I didn’t
expect it to be so loud and you looked so mean. But then I got home and
started thinking about it. About how your muscles looked and how
dangerous it all seemed. It made me like… all excited, and like…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Horny?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here. Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: One sec!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That is so hot!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: My dad keeps it in his closet. Here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now I see the appeal. Give me the camera.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What do you think of this?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That is SO hot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck! It’s my parents!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Hi sweety.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Are you ready for me, you fucking
slut?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: I don’t feel like waiting. Hurry up
bitch. What do you have left to do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: I just need to put on my makeup.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Come on slut.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi mom. Hi dad. What are you guys up to?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: What the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: I told you he would find out you
fucking freak! No wonder he’s a fucking psycho. Look a his father.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Turn off the that fucking camera! Turn
off that fucking camera right fucking now god damn it!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gee dad, what do you say the two of us go out
to the front yard and throw some ball together? We’ll have a nice
friendly game of catch.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: You little mother fucker. Turn off that
fucking camera!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Stop it! You’re going to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Fuck you! You think you know me? You
don’t know me! You piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: You little beast! You want to film
something? Film this!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy! Please
someone call me Nancy. My name is Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: Nancy, Nancy, Nancy… Jimmy please call
him “Nancy” for the love of God. Call your daddy Nancy. Call him
Nancy…!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Take me out to the ball game, take me out to
the crowd, buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s dad</strong>: Give me that fucking tape!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t think so Nancy. Nancy, Nancy,
Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m so glad you’re out. Next time your dad
wants to take it in the ass, DON’T FILM HIM!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know. Ironic that I was the one sent to the
nut house.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I thought I was going to die without you. What
if you and I could live here together? Forever.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Right here?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m serious. Maybe not here, but eventually
we’ll buy some land, and we can live together on it, and be naked
whenever we want.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Excuse me. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I think you’re right mister.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t want this to ever end. I want to be
here forever. I want to dance and be naked and be free, and I want us to
ball our brains out everyday, and I want to feel the air on my body and
I want to get drunk and not care about anything in the world. I just
want us to be together in this moment.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know a place like that.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yep. We can go there one day if you want.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We can? Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Erlanger.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Erlanger!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah Erlanger. Everybody was talking about it
in the nut house. That’s ALL anybody fucking talked about was this dude
who lives up there named Uncle Rodney. He supposedly has a commune where
we can do this kind of thing every day.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Uncle Rodney’s commune?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay, now it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How does it feel to be a free man?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come on, come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Just let it go, be free.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re such a hippie all of sudden.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay, go.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, you really wanna hear something?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I want to go one day without masturbating. I
want to liberate my penis. I want to clone you so we could have a three
way and neither of us would be cheating. I want you to scrape my balls
with a cheese grater…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s gross!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And I love you. I love you so much it
hurts.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It hurts?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Like God is stabbing me in heart with a
thousand knives at the same time and you’re the only one who can make
the pain go away. Do you love me that much?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you so much, I’d rather die than be
without you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Make me a promise… the way a husband and wife
make a promise… that we will be together always and forever.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You mean get married?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Something more powerful than marriage. It’s a
bond. It’s our bond. It’s transcendental.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Transcendental. Here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s transcendental because it transcends
everything. Life, love, law, people, things… A bond so strong that our
souls will become one and it can never end, even in death. If you swear
on the bond, it means you’d rather die than break your promise.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re so beautiful. I want to love you
forever.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Swear on the bond. Swear we’ll be together
forever, that you’d rather die than be apart.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I swear on the bond.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And we’ll never let anything come between us,
not even death.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Not even death. I swear. Nothing will come
between us, ever.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’ll be together forever.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Together forever.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This is action ten news reporter Jimmy Van
Muffmuncher reporting to you live from the parking lot of Dick’s grocery
store where we’re going to witness the beautiful, the talented, the
amazing Judy, commit her first crime.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is there anything you would like to say to
the public and your adoring fans before you go through with this?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher. I just want to say
that I look forward to losing, my, um…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What did you call it before?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Your conformist crimeless virginity.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes, I am very much looking forward to losing
my conformist crimeless virginity. I would also like to share with my
fans these.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thank you and thank your tits for this rare,
behind the scenes look at your first crime slash moment of truth.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy, turn it off. We’re gonna get
busted.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No way, this is the best part.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey you two. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>store manager</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>store manager</strong>: Turn that damn thing off. You can’t
be running around the store playing with a camera. It’s against the
store policy. Now get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What is the matter with you Jimmy? You almost
got us caught. You’re so worried about that camera. What is it? What is
it!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Twenty years from now, when we’re together
watching these tapes you’ll realize how special this moment is. I owe it
to you. And I owe it to us to capture everything and anything we do
together.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well you freak me out sometimes. Why do you
have to tape everything? It’s like you have a problem or something.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You know, most of the reason kids think you’re
so weird is because of it. Why do you think everybody makes fun of you?
And then I have to hear it and I have to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So everybody makes fun of me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yeah. Can’t you give the thing a fucking
rest?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And you don’t want to deal with it? Well fuck
them and fuck you too if you think that. I couldn’t give a fuck what
people say. This is my life and I want to document it. And right now me
filming you happens to be the only reason I manage to get out of my
fucking bed every morning! You can’t take this away from me!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How does it feel Jimmy? How does it feel to
have someone taping you while you’re crying?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Tell me. Look at the camera and tell me how it
feels!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re not getting it. It doesn’t matter how
it feels right now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well can you at least try?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. I can most definitely try.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And you can never, ever, ever ask me to not
film you or anything we do. That’s the only thing I’ll ever ask of you.
Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Will you swear to it? On camera, will you
swear to it?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Please raise your right hand.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please repeat after me. I Judy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I Judy…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do hereby solemnly swear…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Do hereby solemnly swear…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That I will never ask, request, or even
insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That I will never ask, request, or even
insinuate to Jimmy to cease filming, no matter the situation.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And furthermore, I do hereby solemnly swear
to commit myself to giving Jimmy his daily blowjob and will continue to
perform various sex acts with the skill and enthusiasm that he has
become accustomed to.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Keep your right hand up.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I do hereby solemnly swear to g…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mother fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here, you’re definitely going to want to tape
this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, God Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy stop, please stop. Jimmy… oh god, Jimmy
stop. God damn it, fucking stop!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, God Jimmy, oh God…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>police chatter</strong>: We’re going to need an ambulance
stat at the parking lot of the grocery store on Route 18…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi baby. I miss you. Mwaa! I’ll be waiting for
you when you get out. Be good and don’t wait too long. Look what I did
for you!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t wait to use it on you!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I get a double cheese burger, no pickles,
large fries and a coke?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s what I fucking missed more than
anything. Fast food.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And a number two.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What did you do in there all day?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Masturbated mostly.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You cheated on me! I want to be the only
person responsible for making you cum.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I hope you’re willing to be on call twenty
four hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Seriously, what did you do? What was a day in
the life of Jimmy in the nut house?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, besides masturbating, I talked and
talked and talked and fucking talked until they were satisfied. But
basically I told them what they wanted to hear. I said shit like…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: “Now that I’m finally able to talk about my
problems, I now realize that my behavior was inappropriate and harmful
to others.”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Then I figured it out. I had to cry as much
as possible. Whenever someone would cry they’d call it a “break
through.” So I’d be like.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You start out slow, then you build it up like
this… “Now I know that using violence is not the answer.”</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Then you go like this: I was wrong, I know I
was wrong and I’ll never do it again. I don’t want to hurt people or
myself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Boo hoo, waaaaaa, boo-hoo-hoo, waaaaaaa. Then
you always give them the obligatory hug at the end. After a couple of
weeks, then they officially diagnose you with something, give you a
prescription, then you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: God, you’re a genius.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So what did they say you have?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ODD. Oppositional Defiance Disorder.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re so lucky. I wish I was diagnosed with
something. What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ODD is a disorder characterized by an
overwhelming pattern of negative, hostile, and defiant behavior which
causes severe delusions where the patient can no longer distinguish
fantasy from reality.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Wow. I love that!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You see. They fucked up my order. I
specifically asked for no pickles.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, no! How will ODD Boy handle this? Will his
ODD brain be able to withstand a pickle screw up at the drive thru?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ooow, jeez, they’re hot! I burnt my nipples
with the pickles.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I love the ghetto. I don’t know what it is
about it. I fucking love it. It’s always the first place I go to when I
get out.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love it when you’re out of the looney bin.
Do you think you might be able to try to avoid the place for a
while?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If they don’t send me to the bin, maybe
they’ll send me to jail.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m serious. You act like it’s no big deal
when you go away!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No it’s not all right! When you’re in there I
have to be out in the real world alone, by myself Jimmy. You go away and
come back like it’s no big deal. Well it is a big deal. I don’t want to
spend another day without you. Do you understand me? I’d rather die.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m not going back.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I promise. I swear on my life and I swear on
our bond, I’ll never go back.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: If you swear on our bond, then I believe
you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you so fucking much.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I was thinking, the last time you got out we
did it like five times, like as soon as we saw each other, we got naked
and started doing it. And today, my parents weren’t even home and I
tried to do some stuff to you, but you were acting like you weren’t
interested.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Was it because you jerked off so much while
you were locked up?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Then why don’t you want to have sex with me
Jimmy? You don’t think I’m pretty anymore?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, no, no! That has nothing to do with it.
After I saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother, I kind of
blocked it out, but when I was in there they kept talking to me and
talking to me about it. Now I can’t stop it from coming into my head.
Every time I get wood, the instant replay machine in my brain projects
this image of my Mom pounding into my Dad.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: God, that’s awful. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah well, you know you didn’t give too much
of an effort to get in my pants anyhow. You just sort of made your sex
face and grabbed my crotch.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How do you like this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Now we’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That is so hot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think you hit someone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh my God, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh my god. Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t put him in here!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re taking him to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No, we’ll get busted.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What… what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s not breathing. He’s not fucking
breathing!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Pop the trunk for me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know right now, but we’re not driving
around with a dead guy in our back seat.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I just want to go home. Jimmy, let’s leave
him. He’s dead. We should just go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Pop the fucking trunk already before someone
sees us!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy, I…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m driving.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you gonna fucking get in!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We should just leave him here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We can’t leave him in the middle of the
fucking ghetto. Get in before someone sees us!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t want him in my fucking car! I want him
out!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s the fucking cops.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just shut up.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s the cops. It’s the cops. It’s the…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shhhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You gotta play it cool, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stop fucking crying. Please, I’m begging you.
Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh God. He’s getting out of the car. We’ve got
a dead homeless guy in our trunk and he’s…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, my god Jimmy, he’s walking towards us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: SSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Just be cool.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Good evening. License and registration
please.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Certainly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Could you please step out of the vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What happened!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just shut the fuck up! I don’t fucking want
to talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m filming.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s dark. You can’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s on infra-red. Do you wanna see?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No, I don’t wanna see.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s beautiful. He really is. There’s a
certain serenity to death I appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He’s dead. He’s in my car, Jimmy, and he
stinks. I wanna go home.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t think I can do this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m not like you. I can’t do this. I wanna
fucking go home.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, well you can’t fucking go home. And you
will do this. You did do this. You killed him. You didn’t get in the car
until the cops showed up. Now we don’t have a choice. You want me to go
to jail? You want that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We just need to make intelligent decisions.
That’s all. We’ll find a way to take care of it. Then we’ll go away.
We’ll fix it. It’ll be okay. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You promise?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s gonna be okay. I’m gonna take care of
everything. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, my god. The hair burning is making me
nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, God damn. Burning bodies fucking
stinks. That bum’s body odor is being cooked right off him.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What? I’m not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t have to be in the mood. Doesn’t matter.
The camera’s on, it’s on. You wanna know where we’re gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay, where are we gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re going to Lincoln to visit Dinko.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Who’s Dinko, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s cool. And he’s got his own place, and he
said I could stay there whenever ever I wanted. Plus he knows about you
and he wants to meet you. And he doesn’t like cops, so he’s not gonna
call ’em. Okay? Now gimme a smile.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gimme a smile, and I’ll let you see my smiley
face again.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I can’t get sexy with that smell. I just
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Hey! The video-man. I remember that shit when
we was in together. Said you video-ed everything.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Hey man, it’s cool if you guys stay here for
a while, but I have a small business to run man. There’s going to be
some people knocking on the door and shit. I can’t have you guys
answering the door or the phone. That’s the only rule. Other than that
man, we’re going to getting fucked up together all the time. I got a
shit load of crank dude, that shit is off the fucking hook. Here, take a
hit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No thanks, I just want to film Judy
dancing.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Right man. That’s cool. Hey um… If I tell you
to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. I got some hard core junkies
coming over here. Sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking
flip. Crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. They’re
fucking hard core mother fuckers. You don’t know what they’re gonna
fucking do. This one guy got paranoid about something. He used to climb
on his roof to take a dump. That’s the only place he would shit! How
fucked up is that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re not even paying attention to me
Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t I look sexy?</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Yeah, you look real sexy baby. Real nice.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Hey, I may have some work for you if you’re
cool with that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: You know some hustling, some good money. I’ll
teach you how to mix the shit. Your girlfriend too if she wants.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. That’s what I’ve always wanted to do.
Learn to make and sell crystal methamphetamine. You’re a fucking genius
Dinko.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Yeah, man! Fuckin’ high five.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: So is she, like, your girlfriend or are you
guys just fucking?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She’s my girlfriend, my best friend, and yes
we fuck. And don’t ever, ever fucking touch her. That’s MY only rule
Dinko.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: It’s all good man. I ain’t gonna touch your
old lady. Shit man, she’s so into you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: So there’s this dude. Fucker taught me
everything I know about meth and shit. He’d fucking flip for your girl,
man. You should go up and see him. He’s in Erlanger.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Uncle Rodney?</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: Right, right! I forgot. Yeah, Uncle
Rodney!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You have an Uncle Rodney baby?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I want to meet your uncle.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s not my uncle. He’s not anybody’s uncle.
People just call him that. He’s the one I told you about from the nut
house.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I said one day I’d take you up to Erlanger
one day, remember?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: When we were naked.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’re always naked, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Fuck… Woah, that’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>dinko</strong>: That’s some good shit, huh?</p>

<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Snort it. Give some of it away.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The cash.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Vacation baby. Anywhere we want to go.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: You know the video’s gonna cost you twenty
extra, right?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Well alright then. Let’s get this sum bitch
started!</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Weeeeeelllll, you ain’t nothing but a young
bride… walking down the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Here she comes.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: You ain’t nothing but a young bride… walking
down the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Well, if you don’t marry Jimmy, then you
ain’t no friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Do you…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy. And here, we wrote our own vows.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Do you Judy promise to always swallow, to
never cut your hair, or have another man’s penis injected into any part
of your body for as long as you both shall live?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Do you Jimmy promise to always fuck Judy with
enthusiasm, to take a shower once a day, and promise not to inject your
penis into any part of another person’s body as long as you both shall
live?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: Can I get the rings?</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: With the power vested in me by the great
state of Nevada… I do herby pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss
the bride.</p>
<p><strong>elvis</strong>: All right you two. We got a schedule to
keep.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hurry up Jimmy, hurry, hurry, hurry, shit
Jimmy. You’re going to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: …press conference in a few moments. The
suspect’s names are James Wright and Judy Elizabeth Oaks-Kellen…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No it’s not! I’m Judy Wright now! I’m Judy
Wright now!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shhhh… Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: …from Burlington, Kentucky are wanted for
questioning in the alleged murder of a Hamilton County Sheriff’s Deputy
that was killed two nights ago while on Patrol in the Over the Rhine
section of Cincinnati. On a very serious note, the producers here at
KPX-TV 4 would like to warn you that the images we are about to show are
violent and graphic in nature and may not be suitable for young
children. Once again, these are the images that were taken from a video
camera that was mounted on board the patrol car. Viewer discretion is
advised.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Go ahead and open it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Put your hands on the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: On the vehicle, now!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I didn’t want us to be apart.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They know who we are now. Actually, we’re
famous now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever even
heard of.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: …have a few words and then we’ll be taking
questions.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh my God, that’s my parents! And your
parents!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s mom</strong>: We are very shocked about recent
events. Our son has always been a dear sweet boy who is sometimes
confused, but we want him to know that we love him very, very much and
just want this whole thing to be over.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Shhhh…</p>
<p><strong>judy’s dad</strong>: Jimmy if you’re out there, we know
you’re scared, but you’re only making it worse. Please bring Judy back
to us. We really miss her terribly.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wait a second.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I just want to look at myself one last time
with hair.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: OK, that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m not sure about this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come on. I changed mine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, but you look fucking great.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This was your idea Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck it. Let’s do this thing.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This is the look.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s just leave it like this.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I am one ugly mother fucker.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It feels funny.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I look like Dr. Evil.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on. Let’s go across the street and get a
shit burger.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re such a fucking pig when you eat.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaahhh!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Gross. That’s it. I’m not taking you to the
country club, ever!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Awww… I’m sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’ll take you to the country club. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Thanks for marrying me. You’re my prince
charming that came and swooped me off me feet.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: And one day, we’re gonna have a house and a
white picket fence and a baby. Tell me what you think we should name the
baby.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shhhh. Shut up. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: They’re outside our room.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh God, Jimmy! They know where we are. We’re
going to get caught!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They don’t see us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know. Just shut up! Let me think.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are they coming?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. I don’t think they’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, fuck. That was close.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey baby, wake up baby. Time to get up little
fuck nugget.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Good morning Mrs. Wright. And how are we
feeling this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s a surprise. Come on. I want you to drive
us in. I want to film you when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What am I gonna see?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I hate it when you do that. Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nope. Keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How much further! Aaa!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shhh. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh my God. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is this where your friend lives?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This is where we live.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe. If you want to. For a little
while.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This is sooo amazing. It’s like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Go over here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Stop here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is that Uncle Rodney?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, that’s Buddy. He said Rodney’s been
expecting us. We’re, like, celebrities or something Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah! He wants to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We got like thirty five trailers here. Long
as we’ve got some that’s empty you can stay in one. Sometimes people
come in and we got get you a tent or– fuck, everybody’s friendly— you
can always find a bed to crash in.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It don’t look like much but we do some pretty
good partying around here. Ya’ll are welcome to stay as long as ya like.
Fuck it, you can stay forever. There’s only two rules. Don’t mess around
with the labs which are down back there…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Woah… No filming that shit. Seriously. That’s
part of rule number one.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Other than that, ya’ll can do whatever the
hell you want, whenever the hell you want. You wanna do some of the
stash at the parties, that’s cool too. We’d like it if you do it,
normally we’d say you gotta sell some too, but Rodney says y’all’s is a
special case ’cuz you ain’t leaving ’til the heat’s off for sure, that
could be months or… shit, years for you guys. But no one up here’s in a
fucking hurry.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Look at you. Little bitch from the nut house,
and you got yourself one sweet looking bride! I still can’t get over the
tits on this girl. Come here sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We’re gonna have a party for y’all tonight.
You know that? We have parties damn near every night, but this one’s
gonna be special just for you guys. You like that sweety?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Sure Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Nice piece of ass you got here. Best you keep
an eye on it so it don’t wander off on ya.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: We’re here!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Shit! Y’all’s on your honeymoon. Ain’t gonna
film it yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hold on! Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: And, three, two, one… Now!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: All right! Look at the happy couple coming
into their new home. Da, da, da, dum…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How do you turn this thing off?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Just give your love to Uncle Rodney and
you’ll get it back ten times. Don’t be afraid to love him and you’ll
learn to love yourself in return. He’ll teach you the cycle, how we’re
all connected. If you give yourself freely and completely to him, you’ll
have nothing to worry about. That’s what I did.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ya’ll are going to love it here man. See
this?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This shit goes on every day. I been here for
six months man and I love it. Thank God my parents kicked me out… All
you got do is listen to Uncle Rodney and you’ll have the best fucking
time of your life. Oh, yeah. And don’t fuck with him, ’cuz he’ll kick
your ass!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy, come swimming. The water’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Later. I just want to look at you now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Because you look happy, happier than you’ve
looked in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hey again.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So you like it here?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How long will they let us stay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s up to Uncle Rodney.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I never met him. He’s supposed to be cool,
though… and weird. Weird as hell.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well if he’s weird, he’s great weird, whatever
he is.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The cops won’t come will they?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Buddy said Rodney’s cousin’s the Sheriff or
something. Do you want to meet him?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No! Rodney.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m gonna see him tomorrow. Buddy says he
wants to talk to me. Maybe he wants to talk to you too.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He does?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know. Buddy said he thought you were
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I told you you were. You’re the prettiest
girl in the world.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You nervous?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I would be.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He’s suppose to be cool.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He’s more than cool man. God, you really
don’t have a clue do you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Um… Judy wants to meet him. I don’t know if I
can ask.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Shit man. Don’t have to. She’s one of his
girls, man. She’ll meet him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What the fuck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Relax dude… Just like you’re one of his boys.
Shit man, I’ll give you two weeks and you’ll WANT her to experience him.
You may even want to, too.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Just go see him. Here, take your camera.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: He wants you to film him, man. With the
camera. He’ll tell you when to turn it on, then you video.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just one second.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Take your time man. I want you to feel
comfortable. More importantly, I want you to get this right.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m ready whenever you are.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Just a second. I have to take care of
my baby.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: She’s beautiful isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Some people come here too far gone.
Like Hazel here. The only thing I can do for her is ease her pain.</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Shhhhh… How about a baby one?</p>
<p><strong>hazel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: There you go…</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: There’s something about addiction that
brings out something beautiful in a person. Addiction is pure. Addiction
reduces a person to an infant. And there’s nothing more pure and
beautiful in the world than an infant.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Hazel is no longer an adult. She’s an
infant and I’m the surrogate mother who provides her with much needed
breast milk. It’s a role that both of us have accepted and embrace.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: That’s my girl!</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: She’s a little jumpy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Let’s begin shall we? And please… I’m
going to use this tape for my fans, so let’s try to get this right.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: I apologize if any of this frightens
you or makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: No. You won’t be fine. What I’m going
to teach you will be frightening. The truth is an acquired taste but
once you get to it, it’s all you’ll ever want.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Those kids out there… we, the so
called “undesirables” - you and me, we know the truth. You know that
society doesn’t want you, your parents don’t want you, corporate America
sure as fuck doesn’t want you… You wouldn’t be here otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: The garbage culture… thrown aside,
imprisoned, institutionalized, systematically abused, executed, and
enlisted into wars started by government ass- fuckers just to kill us
off. JUST TO KILL US OFF. And every week one of you shows up here,
disillusioned, addicted, angry, pissed ’cuz they tossed you aside… into
the garbage. Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage
culture gets a little bit stronger and they get a little bit weaker.
Until the “them” and the “they” of this country run out of places to put
us, to put its garbage, and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities
from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for
us.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: And we will SET FIRE to their world!
And we will burn it, until a living HELL REIGNS over what was their
former world, and we will fornicate in their ashes!</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: That’s what’s here for you. That’s
what’s here…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’s Judy?</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: I’m so glad you guys came down here.
We never would have guessed you’d come and see us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’ve been awesome. Judy loves it here.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: I knew she would. By the way.</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: I know what you did to Dinko.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?! Jimmy,
Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy! Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Shut it, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Here, here, here. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Please somebody help us!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy!</p>
<p><strong>rodney’s big guy #1</strong>: Shut up, asshole! You wanna
fucking talk!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>rodney’s big guy #1</strong>: Is he fucking dead?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy! Jimmy say something!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Jimmy. Jimmy say something.</p>
<p><strong>rodney’s big guy #2</strong>: Get her clothes off.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Noooooo! Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>uncle rodney</strong>: Who the fuck…!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake up!</p>
<p><strong>rodney’s big guy #3</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy? Judy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy wake up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you all right baby? Please wake up Judy.
Judy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy, sweetie. Come on honey. I saw you
waking up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: There ya go.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi, baby.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Am I with you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Then I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Mexicooooooh….</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hey baby.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Baby?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on. Not the camera.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Nooooo. It reminds me of when we first met.
Just you, me, and the camera. God, do you remember how you used to freak
me out?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, those were the good old days. How much
money do we have?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know, why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How do you feel about Canada? It’s
closer.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Are we going together?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think I should take you home.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I could write you a letter. Or I could make a
video saying I made you do everything. They’d believe you. You could
tell them it was all my fault. You could tell them I was going to Mexico
and I’d really go to Canada.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We swore on the bond we’d never be apart…
but…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re never leaving me, and I’m never leaving
you. That’s all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Owww.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You’re so handsome, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jimmy, stop the car. You’re too fucked up to
drive.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Huh? Oh… okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You wanted to ask me something?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You know I do.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know I love you, right?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s it baby. We’re done.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just pull over. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy, what are you doing? You know this
is…</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on, it’s over. I’ll do what I said
before. I’ll tell them I made you do it. It’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. I want us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well we fucking can’t, so pull the fuck
over!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes we can. I won’t give you up. I won’t let
you go. No way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy! Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Judy!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We’ll be together. We’ll be together. We’ll be
together. We’ll be together…</p>
