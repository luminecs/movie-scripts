<h1 id="while-she-was-out">while-she-was-out</h1>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Damn! DELLA!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: SHOOT, KENNETH! That’s Tammi’s favorite
doll.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: You should just swear properly and get it
over with. Do you think the kids don’t know what you mean?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto
Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives’ reading group?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I got a new one for you.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Group therapy for women who always have the
curse. There’s a Tuesday night class at the Pleasant Valley
Episcopalian.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I’m going to the mall for wrapping paper.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause
it sure isn’t keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I’m mortgaged up
to the eyeballs for this?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I mean it’s not like you’re at some salon
fancying up your hair or nails like the other men’s wives.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: The last time I saw you wearing something
sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a
chocolate cookie with their milk.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Jesus, Della. Della honey, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tammi</strong>: Mommy can I get an American Girl for
Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: You better leave Santa a note. It’s only
three days until Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>tammi</strong>: Where are you going, Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then
Daddy will read you a bedtime story.</p>
<p><strong>tammi</strong>: Daddy’s stories are lame. I want you to read
us a story.</p>
<p><strong>terri</strong>: Yeah Mommy, the one about the pirates.</p>
<p><strong>tammi</strong>: No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot
Kitty.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Tomorrow night I’ll read you the best bedtime
story in the whole world. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I’ll check in on you both when I get back. To
make sure you’re sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Thank you, Tammi, it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Frick!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I’ll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER
you stop drinking.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Della, it’s Mary Messina.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Oh, hey.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You okay sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Sure. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m well.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: How’d you get my cell number?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I called Kenneth at the house.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: And how’d that go? Did he give you an earful
for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon Four?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh Della. Kenneth is always charming. At least
to me.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Well, with the way you flaunt your double D
boob job at the free fun PTA events that’s hardly a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Oh nothing, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You got lucky with that one. Patricia Ellis
says he’s the best looking guy in Pleasant Valley.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Well that wouldn’t be hard. Mary, do you need
something? Cause I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, are you going to Tool School
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It Yourself
Mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right
now. I carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m just joking, Della. You know me. I
pre-paid ten classes and only made it to two. If you are going I could
use a ride. I’d hate to miss another class.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Sorry, Mary, I’m skipping this week.
Kenneth’s parents are coming to stay for Christmas. You know how it
is.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh that’s too bad. Maybe Patricia Ellis will
be going.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: You check with her, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Merry Christmas. God bless you and your
family.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: You too. Bah Humbug.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Bye, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Cellular 411 connect. How may I direct
your call?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: The Learning Academy. Spring Street.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Please hold for that number.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Press your pound key now to connect with
your request.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Learning Academy, this is Meghan.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Hi Meghan. It’s Della Myers.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Oh hey. You calling about Spanish for
Beginners? You know that Tom cancelled ’cause of New Year’s.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Yes I knew.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Can you hold, I have another call?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>local ad</strong>: Pleasant Valley Dream Homes. The lowest
crime rate in the US. Call 1-</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Sorry Della …</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Can you leave word for Mike. I’m going to
miss tomorrow’s Mechanic’s class. It’s just the one time.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Everyone misses that class at least
once.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I guess some people find it boring.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: We’ll see you the first week in January
then?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Yes you will…unless I run off and become an
outlaw or something.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>meghan</strong>: Merry Christmas</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Hi Della… it’s Cassie.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Where are you? Grand Central Station?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Hold on, I’ll take the phone outside.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Just a minute, Della.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: What’s up, Cassie?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I’m over at Southeast Plaza. What was it we
need to get for Pilates?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Huh? One of those rubber balls, I think. I’m
headed over there now. Ran out of Christmas wrapping paper. Would you
believe it?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It’s hell here tonight. Everyone and their
uncle is at the mall.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Aw shoot. My cell battery’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Damn, I must have left the charger in the
other car.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: You want me to pick up something for you
while I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: No….I’m just. I mean I’m. Oh nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Your phone’s breaking up Della. I’m not
joking when I say it’s packed over here.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: It can’t be that bad?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Why don’t we meet somewhere for a drink?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Sure, but a latte’s about the best they can
do in this mall.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: A latte’s fine. Let’s meet at the fountain
opposite Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: My battery’s going. I’m a block away. See you
in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Okay but I won’t be able to wait very ….</p>

<p><strong>della</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Do you know where I can definitely find
parking?</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop</strong>: There’s nothing close by. Even the
valet’s backed up. You might want to try further out.</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop</strong>: But be willing to walk.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>perfume sales lady</strong>: It’s a classic revival of Chanel
No.5. We have a wonderful Christmas Special on offer at Macy’s.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vs sales assistant</strong>: It’s pure silk, the last one in
our classic black label collection. Would you like me to fix you a
changing room?</p>

<p><strong>della</strong>: A latte please?</p>

since college. You left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard
from you again.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Something like that. Do you live around here
now?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: David and I just bought this divine house in
Pleasant Valley. Do you know it? Great for the kids.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It’s the first time I’ve left the doors
unlocked since I was a child growing up in the Midwest. David’s been
promoted to VP of United Motors so it’s all happening for us. But enough
of me. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi and
Terri.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Why that’s fantastic. Listen Della, it’s been
great talking to you but I have to go get my hair done! David and I are
going out tomorrow night for a romantic dinner. I just bought this
gorgeous teddy from Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Hope we bump into each other again soon,
sweetie. Merry Christmas</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: It’s a pity they don’t have any “To a bastard
at Christmas” cards.</p>
<p><strong>ph sales assistant</strong>: Perfect timing!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: God planned it for Christmas Day just to tick
me off.</p>
<p><strong>ph sales assistant</strong>: Thirty dollars and sixty nine
cents</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ph sales assistant</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: How come the ladies’ bathroom is out of order
on a night like this?</p>
<p><strong>cleaning lady</strong>: The one at the other side of the mall
is open, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>carol singers</strong>: Silent Night. Holy Night. All is

<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Nah, it ain’t about to rain diamonds, Huey.

<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Get a grip, skippy.</p>

<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You know we don’t speak the Chinky.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: What’s your game, Chuckie? We left stumbling
around in the dark while you hog the flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I stole it. I get to use it. That’s how it
works. That right Tomas?</p>
<p><strong>tomas</strong>: Right on, dog.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: What if I steal it from you?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: There you go, bro.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: April Fool. Naw, wait a minute, it ain’t
April. Must be Christmas fool.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Her footprints disappear at the big
rock.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Head on up and search the slope. I’ll guide
your way with the flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>tomas</strong>: We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>tomas</strong>: You going home in a casket tonight.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Huey?</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Is that you, homie?</p>

<p><strong>tomas</strong>: Unnh! Unnh! Unnh!</p>
<p><strong>tomas</strong>: Unnh!</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Curb the squealing. You a gangsta or a boy
scout?</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Tomas’s gone, Chuckie. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got
her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: There’s something over here.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: It looks like a body.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: It’s a big old tree trunk, you paranoid
gook.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Tomas…..IYAH!</p>

<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: It was a stupid ass accident killed Huey.
You know that. And Tomas….</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I promise you this.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: This baby’s gonna cancel her Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Ain’t no gun can kill a ghost gone bad.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You in America now, dude, where the ghosts

<p><strong>della</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I’m so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Where are you, God?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Please, I just want to see my babies
again.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Aaaarrhh.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: I don’t feel good, Chuckie. You think I got
the hypothermia?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Nah, yo got the yellow fever.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: I’m telling you, it ain’t natural how she gets
away every time.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: She got to be hiding up on the slope? You
head up first and I’ll follow with the flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: I ain’t going up there without the gun. End of
story.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Never would’ve pegged you as a pussy, Vinh.
Even when Huey and Tomas called it, I always defended your ass.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Ain’t no one never said I was a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can’t be
weighing in at more than one twenty.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Tomas an Huey never called me a pussy.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I ain’t speaking ill o’ the dead.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: You already did.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Anyways, when you ever shot a gun? Probably
miss and shoot yourself in the foot.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: That’s the spirit gangsta. Holler if you
see her and I’ll shoot.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Faito!</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Vinh?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Della?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Delllaaa?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: There’s only you and me, now.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I saw a little trail of your blood back
there. You must be hurt.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I’m hurting too. I think you busted up my
collarbone.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I know you can hear me, Della.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie?</strong>: I can smell your blood, your sweat. I know
you’re close.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: After what went down tonight, we got a
special bond.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: May as well come out now, Della.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I’ll save one for you, for when you decide
to come out.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You’re one tough bitch.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: And that’s hot, hell yeah.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: And they’re really cute.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Twins huh? Terri and Tammi.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I bet you could use that cigarette now
Della honey? A woman’s purse can tell her whole life story!</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Now I know where they are living, I’m
thinking I may stop by after and say hello.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: They wouldn’t know a damn thing about what
happened to Mommy while she was out, would they, Della?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I figured that would help you find your
voice!</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Don’t worry. I would never touch them. It’s
wrong to hurt kids! Right, Della?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: The game’s over.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You won!</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You took him from me…He was only seventeen
years old. And all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean. And he never
saw it. No, he never got to go.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: They’re all gone now.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You know the movie “Clockwork Orange”?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Well, they were my droogies, Della.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Chances are they would of turned on me
anyway, just like in the movie.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: None of them was real ass outlaw. No, not
in the way you are. You’re the real deal, lady.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I was already thinking about cutting some
of em loose, getting a new style posse together.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: How’s about it, you and me?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Monday night mechanics. Tuesday Pilates.
Wednesday Spanish. Thursday, I wish….</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Face it, Della. You ain’t no suburban
housewife.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: So you bought into the big lie, even tried
to live it. Who could blame you? Husband, kids, security, every woman’s
dream, but not yours, Della. You know there ain’t no such thing as
security.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: But I’m betting you didn’t really know who
you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you’ve been dreaming about
though, what you’ve been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted
years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the
wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all
the things they told you you ain’t supposed to do. Taking what YOU want
from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Don’t say you ain’t thought about it. If
it’s in your blood, it’s in your blood for all time.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You had yourself fooled, Della.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Shit, lady, you took my whole crew out with
nothing but a bunch of them tools.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You can’t go back to your old life. No way.
It’s all over for that. Kaboom.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Hooking up with me’s about the best chance
you got.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I bet you’re on the outs with your old
man.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: When we pick up your kids, we can waste him
if you like.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I can do it. Or you can if you’re
ready.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I want…</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Leave the tools.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I already did.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Hell of a night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I was only going to the mall for some
Christmas wrapping paper.</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Shit happens.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: I wanted to look you in the eye before I
kill you.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: That’s what I figured.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Huey there, going to help?</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: Huey? Huey’s ….</p>
<p><strong>chuckie</strong>: You’re even better than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: I said….</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Della?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Della honey are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Please don’t call me that. Don’t ever call me
that again.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: I just wanted to get home to my babies.</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Was there an accident?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Are they okay?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: Sound asleep, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kenneth</strong>: So. What’d you bring me from the mall?</p>
<p><strong>della</strong>: Nothing.</p>
