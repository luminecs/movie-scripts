<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well…how do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Ask me in about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m talking about graduation. Being totally
free to do whatever we want now.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: It feels excellent.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Gotta throw the anchor over.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: C’mon, Jimmy. Something’s bothering you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s just that we’re right around that old
summer camp where all those murders took place.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What murders?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Never mind, you don’t want to know about
it.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy’s
dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake…if you believe the
stories. Let’s drop it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: What stories?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who
drowned in Crystal Lake…</p>
<p><strong>young jason</strong>: Hhhhelp….me….I’m drowning…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: None of the counselors heard him.</p>
<p><strong>young jason</strong>: Mmmmmmommy….</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A bunch of years went by and everybody forgot
about it. That’s when the murders started.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Jason did it…?</p>
<p><strong>jim’</strong>: That’s what some people thought. But they were
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: His mother blamed the counselors for his death
and tried to kill them all. She got her head chopped off by one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: So the murders stopped?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge
his mother’s death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area. And
every now and then, the murders start up again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Forget about it, Suzy. They’re just
stories.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: We’re the last graduating class, right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors
for good, right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: So there’s no reason for him to come back
because there won’t be any of us around…right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Right. Except that Jason isn’t real so none of
it matters anyway.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: C’mon, I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All right, I’ll check it out.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Jimmy…?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Jim…?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean it…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Gotcha good, baby cakes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All right, all right – I’m a major ass.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: And you’ll never do it again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And I’ll never do it again. Forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>suzy</strong>: JJJJJJJJason…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh-huh. You must really think I’m an ass.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ohmygod…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Remember girls, the shuffleboard
tournament will start at six p.m. sharp. A non-attendance will restrict
your time in port, understood?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’re telling me this boat has a pool with a
three meter board?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s a ship and that’s right. Plus a disco,
gym, game room and a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I think I’m gonna blow off New York and just
stay on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’ll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Your itinerary has been carefully planned
and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Of course…wouldn’t want to risk enjoying this
trip.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Rennie’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: But I thought…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: She changed her mind. Let’s see…Mr. Wolfe
is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in
two-twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Sean – where the hell have you
been? We’re already into early departure protocol…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Be right up, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I’m glad you decided to come after
all.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Me too. But I’m not sure Uncle Charles will
be.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: You let me worry about him, okay?
Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie.
You made the right decision.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What about not-so-great writers?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Just felt a little chill.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Did you know that I’m giving up
teaching?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Since the school is closing anyway,
I’m going to write that novel I’ve been threatening on everybody.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: That’s wonderful, Miss Van Deusen…what’s it
about?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: A senior class cruise to Manhattan,
laced with romance, adventure and murder. Or a Gothic cook book. I
haven’t decided which.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Go on, open it.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Stephen King supposedly used it
when he was in high school.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I don’t know what to say…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Rennie, you’re the best student I
ever had…you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it’s
you.</p>
<p><strong>. tamara</strong>: Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock ’n
roll or what, girl?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watanabe</strong>: Hello, Tamara.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watanabe</strong>: Yes, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Don’t worry about a thing, Mom. I’ll have a
terrific time and I won’t do anything stupid, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. watanabe</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I hear the crew members are cute guys in
their twenties.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I’m sure we’ll have no problem getting them
to party with us…especially with this.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: It’s my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost
over a thousand bucks but it’s the best.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: He bought you that?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: More or less. It’s part of my college
fund.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You can stop right there, Miss Mason.</p>
<p><strong>mccull40ch</strong>: Only graduating seniors are allowed on
this cruise.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mccullocb</strong>: You never turned in your final biology
project, so I’ve had your diploma rescinded.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: You can’t do that…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: It’s already been done. Congratulations
on the 3.9 average, Miss Watanabe. You’re in stateroom two-
fifty-five.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car accident
yesterday and missed our appointment. It’s okay, no big deal, just a
bruised arm… …so I brought my project along today. It’s in my suitcase.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: She’s telling the truth, Mr. McCulloch. I saw
her pack it.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: All right. But if it mysteriously
disappears en route, I’ll have you sent back home the minute we dock.
Understood?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: A major prick.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Improvise, of course.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Hello, Charles. Has everyone
checked in?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never
showed up. I’m a little concerned.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Don’t be. They probably decided to
explore each other rather than New York.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Let’s go – we’re running two minutes
late.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Charles, there’s someone else
coming along too.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You have no right…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: And neither do you. It’s up to
Rennie to decide what she wants to do.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: She doesn’t know what she wants. She’s
never had a stable life.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: And she sure doesn’t have one now,
either. She needs to live.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I’m her legal guardian, not you or
anybody else, and I alone know what’s best for her. End of
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: No, I think it’s just the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hhhhelp me…</p>
<p><strong>young jason</strong>: Hhhhelp me….I’m drowning…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What’s wrong, Rennie??</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I just got a little dizzy. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Let’s take in the brow.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Yes Sir. Take in the gangway and
single up all lines.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hello, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your ship.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: She’s a beauty, isn’t she? I
should’ve retired from the Navy ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You’ve really been generous to give us this
cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Hell, there’s just twenty or so
of you – we only need a skeleton crew and it’s a pleasure to sail her
anyway. By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving
championships, Miles. I’m sure you made your old man proud.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Have you decided on your departure
protocol, Admiral?</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Actually, I thought I’d leave the
honors to my son.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Dad, I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Relinquishing command of the
Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: But before you take the helm,
take this.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Something old and something new.
I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn
computers to do all the work for you.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Have you decided on a plan of
departure, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: How about if we start up the forward engines
and come around. 180 degrees…</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Aren’t you forgetting
something?</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: We’re in foggy weather! Send out
the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down,
followed by a security broadcast warning other ships!</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: This voyage is doomed.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yeah, tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Rennie…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Hi, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I heard you weren’t coming.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: We changed our minds.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I got you a present.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: But I didn’t get you one…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Forget it. It’s a dumb little thing
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Sean…it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I thought maybe we could hike to the top of
the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It’s supposed to be
22 stories tall.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Your father was looking for you,
Mr. Robertson.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I guess I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: There’s a storm predicted tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’re making a big mistake, Rennie. It’s
not too late to put you back on land.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you
were of…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: She didn’t push me into coming.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Why are you doing this to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I don’t even know why I’m afraid, Uncle
Charles. I can’t even remember when it started. Don’t you think it’s
time I found out and got over it?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Facing your fear doesn’t always conquer
it.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’m staying.</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: Is this axe awesome or what?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Too cool, J.J. Your parents came through.</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: No lie. I hear there’s a big power room down
below where I can get supreme concert hall echo. Come down and shoot a
basement tape on me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Sure…but I gotta shoot some shockumentary
footage first.</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: Man, don’t tell me you’re still trying to scam
on Tamara…</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: How long have we known each other? Don’t be a
dweeb, Wayne. She’s not interested in you, only what you can do for her.
She’s a user.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: She’s sexy.</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: So’s this guitar. So what?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I’ll catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>j.j.</strong>: This place is aching for a video. Wayne,
you’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What do you think…time for some personal
experiences to fuel our minds?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Okay Toby, calm down…</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I’m not sure we’re supposed to be here,
Tamara.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Is that a muscular bod or what?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: He’s undefeated, you know that? Julius is
the only senior I’d even consider doing it with. If he wasn’t black,
that is.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: My parents are open minded about that sort of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: My stepmom couldn’t care less, but Daddy
would have a shit fit. He might even pay some attention to me.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Gorgeous guy at ten o’clock. Look
sensual.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I think it’s time for some recreational
activity, girl.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Sounds good. I hear there’s a shuffleboard
court on deck – it might be kinds cool…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: You’re joking, right?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Have you seen my niece anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. What’s
the problem, Mr. McCulloch?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Senior predictions started five minutes
ago and she hasn’t shown up.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Some of us don’t want our futures
predicted.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: In your case I’m sure that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: The night time is the right time.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: What? Don’t be a lightweight…this is top
dollar toot.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: It’s not that, it’s just that… It I get caught,
I’ll lose my science scholarship and everything.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: You’re talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do
you really think I’m going to risk getting caught?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Do you realize how many people would kill to
be sitting here right now? Come on, it’s grad night. You’ve got your
whole life to be uptight.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Is that unbelievable or what?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Have you seen my dog? I think he came this
way.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: No, we haven’t. Care for a hit?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: A real space cadet. I wonder if she’ll narc
on us…</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I have her in Creative Writing and she’s fairly
nice.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Toby?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: What are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Are you girls using drugs?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch?
We were just exploring the ship.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I’11 be coming around your stateroom in
exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You’d better have your biology
project ready or I’m phoning your parents.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: They’re out of town.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Then I’ll make sure you remain on board
while your classmates see the sights.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Relax, I’ve got McCulloch covered… but that
little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. Rumor has it
she’s a teensy bit afraid of the water…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Poetry in motion, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: A half-twist short. I’ll hone that dive
yet.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Rennie – I was just on my way over
to your room</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Have you seen my dog anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: No, but I’m sure Toby’s fine. The
ship’s only so big and there’s certainly no way off it, is there?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: So, are you having fun yet?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Yeah…a lot.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I seem to detect a hint of
ingenuousness in your tone. In other words, level with me.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: There’s something I haven’t told you…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Wow, sorry…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Why on earth would you do something
like that?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: It was an accident, I swear…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What happened? Rennie, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: That was truly excellent.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Time to check out the waiters.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I think I’ll pass. See you later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: But…wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Some friend you are.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Bring her a towel, okay?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: She’s fine – everybody go back to
what you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Care to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I can’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I gathered that.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I had a skiing accident in high
school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even
look at the snow again…but the solution kept eluding me. I finally took
lessons. I’ve never broken a bone since.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: It’s not that simple.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Maybe not. But you’re not telling
me everything, are you?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Whenever I get near the water, I see this
young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: When did this start?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: About four years ago…at Crystal Lake. I
spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding
school.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: After your parents passed away?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Did you have an accident in the
lake?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: No. It was just a normal summer. I’ve never
been able to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Only one young boy ever drowned in
that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason
Voorhees.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: She’s fine, Charles. Take it
easy…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Oh, I can see that. You’ve done a
wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: It wasn’t her fault.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Stay away from her…both of you.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: He’s come back and you’re all going to
die.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Just…leave me alone…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: The door’s open.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I’m in no mood for any more stall
tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Wouldn’t you like a glass of champagne
first, Charles?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Where did you get that alcohol?</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I packed it. Just for us.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: That’s it. You’re not setting foot off
this ship until we return home.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: But I haven’t even shown you my biology
project…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make
sure I labeled all my organs correctly.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Oh, you’ve done it now. Not only are you
going home, I’ll see to it that you spend next year back in a high
school classroom!</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: I don’t think so, Mr. McCulloch. Did you get
anything good?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’ll never get away with it. And you
can forget about ever attending any film school. You’re both going to be
very, very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Relax, Wayne. He won’t risk doing a thing.
Can I have the tape?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: This is going to sound supremely lame…but
I’ve had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara.</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: That’s sweet, Wayne. Look, I’d love to chat
but I’m really pressed for time. Let’s try to get together later, okey-
doke?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: But I thought…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Thanks for the camerawork.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Wayne, you’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: It’s not real, it’s not real…</p>
<p><strong>tamara</strong>: Please…please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s okay…you’re going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I want to go home. I want off this ship.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Me too. Let’s go talk to my Dad.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Let’s kick in the stablilizers,
Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one
hell of a storm.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise
mode.</p>
<p><strong>admiral-robertson</strong>: How olds your boy now,
Carlson?</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: Nineteen months.</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: A tremendous age. Take some
advice from a salty old man: don’t push him too hard.</p>
<p><strong>chief engineer</strong>: This is the bridge. Approaching
weather suggests we secure the main deck and…</p>
<p><strong>admiral robertson</strong>: Better have them doublecheck the
lifeboat stations as well…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Can he really take us home?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Not completing a voyage is against everything
he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard
cutter for you.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: If I go with you, he’ll never speak to me
again. But I’m never going to live up to his expectations anyway…so
maybe it’s the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Oh Jesus…Dad??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: He’s…he’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Ronnie? I just came by to see how
you were feeling…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Rennie…?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I thought I told you to stay away from
her.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mccullocb</strong>: That’s a very good question and I’d
appreciate an answer.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Attention everybody, attention. This is Sean
Robertson…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: There’s been… What I mean is, this is an
emergency…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Miles – have you seen J.J.? She was supposed
to be jamming down in the power room but…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Repeat, this is an emergency…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I want everybody to meet on the bridge…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Stay calm, but get here as quick as possible.
Walk with a friend if you can…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: God, I wish this was a joke, but it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What is happening???</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I don’t know…we’ve gone off course or
something…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What do you mean???</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I don’t know what I mean! All’s I know is that
there’s no one guiding this ship anymore…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Can’t you call for help??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I think so. But we have to lower the anchors
so we don’t drift any further…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The bow…front of the ship. There’s a hoist on
each side that lowers them</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I didn’t mean for you to go!</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Just radio for help, okay???</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Mayday, mayday, mayday…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Please…can anybody out there hear me??</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Sean, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Who did this, man?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: Is the radio even working??</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Isn’t there some international S.O.S. thing
you can do???</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Channel 16…the distress frequency… Mayday,
mayday, mayday…this is the Princess Ruby. Please, somebody answer…</p>
<p><strong>radio officer</strong>: This is Coast Guard cutter Dallas.
What is the nature of your problem, Ruby?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The Captain and Chief Engineer… they’ve
been…they’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>radio officer</strong>: What is your location?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I…I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>radio officer</strong>: Is your ship equipped with Omega
satellite navigation or LORAN?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>radio officer</strong>: The LORAN has a digital printout of
your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we’ll be there
as quick as we can.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’ve got the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>radio officer</strong>: Give me the degrees first, followed
by minutes and sec…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hello? Are you there??</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I demand to know what is going on…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Oh dear God…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Where’s the radio?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s…dead.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: You’re all going to die.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: You’re the last ones. He’s come back for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: Jason Voorhees.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’re insane, old man. Jason Voorhees
has been dead for over thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: He walks this ship, here and now.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: A killer walks this ship indeed. And it’s
certainly none of us…</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: You’re the one who’s insane!!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What are you doing??</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: That lunatic has been spouting off about
Jason since we boarded… It’s no coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: But that doesn’t prove that he’s
the one!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Walking corpses are not real!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure enough
real. I say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds
us.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’ll do no.such thing and watch your
mouth, young man! I’m in charge here!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: School’s out, McCulloch. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Please everybody, stay here!!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Christ…where’s Rennie??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: She’s…she’s dropping the anchors. I thought
the Coast Guard could find us easier if…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: What?? You sent her out there with a
murderer running around loose??</p>
<p><strong>jason on its opposite side.</strong>: He begins to stride
parallel to her, then disappears when the windows end and a wall takes
over.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: What’s going on? I heard on the P.A. system
that…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: The Captain’s been murdered. The buzz is that
Jason might be on board.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Jason…Voorhees?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Have you seen Tamara?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No. And I’m not losing any sleep over it.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: But she might be in trouble…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: So what else is new? Look Eva, you’re asking
the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up – it’s not hip to
be her friend.</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: I don’t care about being hip anymore.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’ve gotta find J.J.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Toby?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Tamara? Are you around here anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Tamara?</p>
<p><strong>eva</strong>: Tamara? I just want to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>the ground, kicking madly as the life is being choked
out</strong>: OF HER. Finally Eva’s legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings
her to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is over.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Toby? Where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You had me worried to death!</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: But Sean said…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I’m the one you should be listening to!
Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense
whatsoever?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I managed to scrounge this shit from the
game room and hallways. Grab what you want.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: What are you taking, Julius?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: We’re talking the possibility of Jason
Voorhees here.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Nothin’ but this gun.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Can’t we at least talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I refuse to discuss this ridiculous
notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: But what about the drowning boy I’ve been
seeing?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Whatever you’ve been…imagining… has
nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That’s
all I care about.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’m not staying in my room, Uncle
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: This isn’t a request.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Uncle Charles!</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: J.J. – you down here?</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: We got a major problem, Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>wayne</strong>: No no no…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What was that??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What happens if we don’t get
control of the ship, Sean? I want you to tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: We could hit a reef, collide with another
ship…we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Did you find Rennie?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: She’s locked safe in her room, no thanks
to either of you. Has he brought it back on course yet?</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: He’s doing the best he can,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: He’s the son of the Captain, for
Chrissakes. You’d think he’d be able to operate this thing!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It worked…we’re back on course!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The fire alarm…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Can you shut that damn thing off??</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: We already thought of that – nobody
could possibly see it in this storm…</p>
<p><strong>mcculiach</strong>: There’s only one person who needs to see
it. And I’m going to find him.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What about the fire??</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I doubt very much that one even
exists.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Use some common sense! Setting off a fire
alarm causes panic…the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason
Voorhees is on board. Enough is enough.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: We have to get everybody together just in case
the fire’s for real.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: I’ll take the upper deck.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Miles??</p>
<p><strong>jason’s hand grips his shoulder, spins him around
and</strong>: SLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the
boxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING…</p>
<p><strong>young jason</strong>: Hhhhelp….me….</p>
<p><strong>young jason</strong>: Hhhhelp me….I’m drowning…</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: Hhhhelp….me….</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Rennie…??</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: The window…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I don’t understand what is happening to
me…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s gonna be okay…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What is it??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The power room…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Rule one, don’t panic. Rule two, assess the
damage and act accordingly…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Is the ship going to sink??</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: The emergency lights just kicked in…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: We’ll be okay. I want you to wait by the
lifeboats, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’m not going near any lifeboat!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: But Rennie…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I’m not!!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Everybody wait right here until I
come back with the others – understand?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Rennie??</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Come on, answer!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Water has gotten to the engines. We have to
get everybody off this ship…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Everybody climb in!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: What did you do with Rennie??</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Nothing! I went to her cabin
and…</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Everybody hurry…please…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: She never should’ve set foot on this
ship. This is your fault!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: This is Jason’s fault!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Not another word, do you hear me??</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Why aren’t you with the others,
woman??</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Jason…he has an axe…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Jason Voorhees is dead!!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Dear Christ…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: We have to get off this ship!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Everybody in – I’ll get the hoists</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Come on, sweetheart – get in…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Get in the boat, Rennie!</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I…I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You can and you will!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Stop it!!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Leave her alone, Charles!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: It’s the only way, Rennie. Let’s
get in the boat now, okay? Please…for me?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Toby…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Come on…faster….</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Start rowing!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: He’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It’s Julius!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: If we don’t find the shore soon we’re all
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Do you know where we are, Sean?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Hey man, if I can make it, so can. you.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Hey man, wake up! Check it out!!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: God damn, we’re in New York! You did it, my
man!!</p>
<p><strong>breaks the surface for a breath of air, sinking
again.</strong>: And swimming onward.</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: Hhhhelp…me….</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: It’s okay…you’re safe now…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Come on – everybody up the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: There must be a phone around here
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: A wonderful choice of places to dock a
boat, Mr. Robertson.</p>
<p><strong>gang ranger #1</strong>: Hands up!!</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: Do it!!</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: Got some good shit here, holmes.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: You got that right…</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #l</strong>: Now ain’t that sweet.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: Go ahead, superman. Be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #l</strong>: You got a problem, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Please, don’t hurt her…</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #l</strong>: Hurt this princess? Would I do
that?</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: You look like a party girl,
princess. How’d you like to go on a date with me and my friend? If
you’re free, that is.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: You follow and we’ll blow her
fuckin’ head off, comprende?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: We can’t let those gang-bangers get away,
man…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You heard him! We have to call the
police</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Everyone split up – we’ll cover more
ground that way.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I don’t think that’s such a safe
idea</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: My niece’s life hangs in the balance
right now!! Every second counts.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #l</strong>: Welcome to the casbah, princess.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: Loosen up, baby. It’ll feel way
better if you’re stoned.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: Slang us some more ’caine, JoJo.
We’re in for a long night.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: It’s your parade, princess. Can be
smooth or can be rough. Your choice.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #1</strong>: I think I’m in love.</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: Forgot my money, holmes…</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>gang banger #2</strong>: You’re dead, fuckhead.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Get me the police – this is an
emergency…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Use the combos and keep the feet light…</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Take your best shot, motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Rennie…what’d they do to you??</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Drugs… Then Jason came. He’s here, Sean.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: We have to find the others.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: It’s okay – she’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: My apologies, Miss. My unit’s right over
here.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Rennie, thank God…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Jason’s here in New York.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Is it true, Rennie??</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: Is this the lass in question?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: Who is…Jason?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: He’s a walking corpse, a phantasm from
hell.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: I’m afraid you’ll have some trouble
believing us.</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: So try me.</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: You’re right – I find it a tall tale
indeed. But you seem like honest folks so I’m inclined to believe at
least some of it.</p>
<p><strong>miss van deusen</strong>: Thank you. The first thing we’ have
to do is find Julius.</p>
<p><strong>irish cop</strong>: I’m sure he’ll pop up soon enough. Why
don’t you climb in the back while I radio for backup.</p>
<p><strong>adjust into a full shot of the back door as he swings
it</strong>: OPEN…but even in this darkness, we see that it’s empty.
They climb in. The Cop opens his drivers door, and…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: There aren’t any handles!!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Rennie, for God’s sake slow down!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Miss Van Deusen…</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: What a beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Perfect for a swim, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You’ve been coming out here every summer
for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven’t learned
how.</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: I’ll take some lessons this time. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: That’s what you said last year. I think
the time for your first swimming lesson has just come.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You don’t want to end up drowning like
that Voorhees boy, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: He never learned how either and he’s
still at the bottom of this lake.</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: He is not.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down
anybody who falls in and can’t swim.</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: You’re telling a lie.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Am I? Let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: Better swim before Jason drags you down,
Rennie. Come on, you can do it…</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: I…I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!</p>
<p><strong>young rennie</strong>: Hhhhelp…me….</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: You pushed me…</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: I was only trying to teach you. But I
pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: He was down there!!!</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You keep away from her!</p>
<p><strong>mcculloch</strong>: You…are…NOT POSSIBLE.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: I was at school when they told me. ‘Rennie,
we have some very bad news… your parents have been killed in an auto
accident.’</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: It seems like everybody I care about ends
up…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: Toby…</p>
<p><strong>rennie</strong>: What’s wrong, boy?</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>the turnstile like the terminator, tearing the
aluminum</strong>: WHEEL RIGHT OFF ITS BASE. The Ticket Taker reacts
speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>train engineer</strong>: Hey pal, you can’t do that…</p>

<p><strong>through the diner door, mowing a path straight

<p><strong>close up as jason tears off his mask, exposing his</strong>:
HIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical. Worms
slithering out his nostrils. And his eyes…or lack thereof. They’re like
two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant…and the yolks just
broke, running down his face.</p>
