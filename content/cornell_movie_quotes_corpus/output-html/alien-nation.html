<h1 id="alien-nation">alien-nation</h1>
<p><strong>crais</strong>: That was the scene in California’s Mojave
Desert three years ago today – the historic first view of the Newcomer
ship upon its dramatic arrival. As with the assassination of John
Kennedy, who among us does not remember exactly where he was that
October nineteenth morning, when news first broke: that people have
landed… from another star.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: I remember where I was – pissing off my
balcony at the neighbor’s dog!</p>
<p><strong>alterez</strong>: Get to the goddamn ball scores!</p>
<p><strong>cal-tech professor</strong>: From the time mankind first
gazed up at the stars there had been speculation about a visit by people
from “out there.” How ironic that when that first contact was made, the
two hundred and sixty thousand occupants aboard the craft were as
surprised as we were about their arrival. That they awakened from frozen
hibernation to find their malfunctioning autopilot had landed them here
by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>crais</strong>: These “Newcomers,” we soon learned, were a
genetically-engineered race, adapted for hard labor in almost any
environmental condition. In effect, their ship was a slave ship… washed
ashore on Earth with no way to get back to where they came from…</p>
<p><strong>fresno housewife</strong>: When the Newcomers were first let
out of the ship, they were quarantined in a camp not ten miles from the
town here. You can imagine how the people around here felt about that.
But once they were releases from the camp and we got a chance to know
them, we saw what nice, quiet people they really are…</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Hey, Henry, how you doin’ tonight?
Workin’ hard?</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: You got your green card, buddy? You
didn’t leave home without it?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jeez… they call that gang-bang a game…?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Take a hike.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why’s it have to be sour milk that these guys
get wasted on? What the hell’s wrong with Jack Daniels, or Thunderbird
for chrissakes? Slagtown. Shit…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Hope their plumbing’s the same.</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: So you gonna go, or you not gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How can I go?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your
clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at
the church. Simple. Me and Carol are going.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Hey, look – we’ve known Kristin since… since
she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember? You and Edie
banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our
hair for a week…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Goddammit, Tug – I want to see Kristin get
married, okay? But–</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: But you’re bummed because your ex and her
new husband are paying for the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I
could afford it, we’d be holding the reception at Buddy’s Burgers.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Uh-oh… Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Does that look at all suspicious to you?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Whatever gave you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: This is one-Henry-seven, we’ve got a
possible two-eleven in progress at Porter’s Mini-Mart, corner of Court
and Alvarado. Requesting backup.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Let’s do it, partner.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You got your vest?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Of course. Right in the trunk of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, that’s comforting. Mine, too.</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Watch the driver. I’m going for a better
angle on the door.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I got him. Don’t get pinned.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Aw, shit.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Get outta there!</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: I can’t! Do you mind!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’ll cover you! Get outta there!!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Can I get out now?</p>
<p><strong>tuggle</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Aw shit, Tug, Jesus! Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>human cop</strong>: Whoa, whoa… hold it. Take it easy. You
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am all right.</p>
<p><strong>human cop</strong>: I better call in.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Your hand will require attention.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Get the hell away from me! I don’t need your
goddamn help.</p>
<p><strong>natuzzi</strong>: Looks like a standard combat pump-
action.</p>
<p><strong>minkler</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>natuzzi</strong>: So what punched holes clear through that
car out there?</p>
<p><strong>minkler</strong>: BRI Sabot slugs. These puppies are nasty.
Two plastic sabots fall away in flight leaving a fifty-caliber slug
going two thousand feet per second. Tug might as well’ve been hiding
behind a rosebush.</p>
<p><strong>natuzzi</strong>: Pretty heavy artillery for knocking over a
liquor store.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: An identical round was used in the shooting
of a Newcomer named Hubley, two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>minkler</strong>: Yeah? So why the extra fire power?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Perhaps because even the larger caliber
handguns aren’t always effective against my people.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You saying there’s some connection to this
other homicide?</p>
<p><strong>female cop</strong>: Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
will ya Jetson? We’ve got to get her to Division for her statement and
she won’t budge.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So, you think there’s a connection, or what?
Hey!</p>
<p><strong>kristin’s voice</strong>: Hi, Daddy, it’s me. I’m over at
Danny’s parents’ house… talking about Sunday. I thought maybe you’d be
home by now. Anyway, uh, nothing really. I just wanted to call and say I
love you. I love you, Daddy. Uh-oh, I shouldn’t’a done that. Knowing
you, you’ll probably pull this tape out of your machine and save it – in
that drawer where you keep every card I ever gave you, and all of my old
baby teeth… gross! Anyway, Daddy, don’t save this tape – but I do love
you, and I’ll talk to you before Sunday. Oh, Tug and Carol came by and
met Danny last week. Danny thought Tug was the greatest – but, then, who
doesn’t? Anyway, love you, talk to you soon. ’Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So what’ve you got on Tuggle’s killers?</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Jesus, Sykes – it’s been less than ten
hours. Me and Alterez are on it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You don’t have squat.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?
The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican
war heroes…</p>
<p><strong>alterez</strong>: Up yours.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: … Nobody talks to nobody down there. Half
of them don’t speak English and the other half only when it suits them.
It’s gonna take some time.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, I know it’s gonna take time. Like until
the Ice Capades opens in Hell, with you two on it.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Nobody wanders off! I got an announcement.
Get your asses back in here.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: I’ll make this short. This is a directive
from Chief Evaner, who is acting on orders from the Mayor, who is under
mandate from the Federal Bureau of Newcomer Relations. As of nine
o’clock this morning, one Newcomer uniform officer has been promoted to
the rank of Detective, third grade.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: And we’ve got him, gentleman. Volunteers for
duty with the new detective should see me in my office… otherwise I will
choose a volunteer myself. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Unbelievable bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>alterez</strong>: How long has this Slag been on the force? A
year, max – right?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: I don’t know about the rest of you, but I
sure as hell ain’t gonna sit still for this. I’m calling the union,
pronto.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Where the hell is he going?</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Yeah, Sykes?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Captain. I’d like to volunteer for duty with
the new detective.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: … All right. Detective Sergeant Sykes, this
is Detective… Jetson.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We have met.</p>
<p><strong>goldrup</strong>: Victor Goldrup, Mayor’s office.
Congratulations, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You are to have nothing to do with the
investigation into Bill Tuggle’s death. You know that. Leave that for
Fedorchuk.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Departmental policy.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: There’s another case I’d like to take. A
homicide – a Newcomer named Hubley.</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Granger and Pitts are already on it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
caseload… and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first
Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley’s body being found over in the
Newcomer community…</p>
<p><strong>warner</strong>: Don’t tell me what to think.</p>
<p><strong>goldrup</strong>: He’s got a point. That’s the sort of thing
we should be doing with this early advancement program…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: … and we work my hours. I’ll do the driving,
you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it
all.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Sergeant… I’d like to thank you for what
you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s that? Look, Jetson. Get this straight
in your head. We’re not pals, we’re not married, and we ain’t gonna take
long moonlight walks together… We’re just partners. And don’t call me
Sergeant. Call me Sykes… or Matt if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am George.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Wait a minute. George? George Jetson?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Man, somebody really hung one on you! I’ve
heard some good ones for you guys… Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson. I
guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while,
coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren’t at
the back of the line, were you, George?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: My true name is Ss’tangya T’ssorentsa’.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Gesundheit. You don’t mind if I stick to
George, do you?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Anyway, what’s it matter to you if we think
it’s funny, right? Whatta you care?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: That is exactly so. It is like your name…
Sykes. I’m sure it doesn’t bother you at all that it sounds like “ss’ai
k’ss”, two words in my language which mean “excrement” and
“cranium”.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: “Shit… head”.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Let’s talk Hubley.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: His body was discovered three days ago, in
an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Through the chest. Rupturing both the
primary and secondary hearts.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nice signal, dickwad!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: He was employed at the Northwest Petroleum
Refinery in Torrance. He was manager of the Methane Facility. He was
also a principle partner in a real estate venture to develop low- cost
housing for Newcomers.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Terrific. A real pillar of the community. Was
Hubley missing anything when they found him? Was he ripped off?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: There was no wallet… but he was still
wearing a watch and two rings.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: The guys at the mini-mart last night made a
half-assed stab at the money in the till – but I don’t think that’s what
they were there for. I think we got us a couple’a executions on our
hands, George…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.
The Captain said–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Look, you want to fit in here, right? You
want to learn how to get along?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, there’s a thing about partners, about
being somebody’s partner. You do for each other. And other people’s
rules don’t mean shit. It’s the rules set up between the two of you,
that’s all that counts. Understand? Okay. Well, my friend and partner
was shot last night and I’m after the shitbag that did it. As my
partner, I’m asking you to respect me and help me find him.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: And as my partner, I ask you to respect me
and my desire not to break with procedure.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: What is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nothing’s wrong. I just want to get something
straight. You agree that there’s a good chance these two shootings are
somehow related, right?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Well… yes, quite possibly.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Possibly. Good. Well, would you be willing to
accept the theory, George, that… possibly… by examining the evidence
from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other? Does
that sound unreasonable to you?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Yes… no, it is not unreasonable. Although
I–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Great. Well, I’m sure glad that’s settled,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I think we’re really starting to click now,
George – hmmm?</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: You know I’ve been over all this with
Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Come on. You got nothin’ better to do, cushy
county job like yours.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Yeah, right. Don’t push your luck. Anyway,
according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: The human?</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Yeah… he was one Martin Helder. White male,
twenty-seven. Let’s see… wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction,
a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired
on coke when you stopped his clock.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Have you identified this one?</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: So far he’s a John Doe. Or a Sam Slag, if
you like.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: No I.D. on him and – well, you know, no
fingerprints – so it could be tough. Your buddies this morning went
through the mug book but couldn’t make a facial match.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Fedorchuk couldn’t find his ass with his
hands in his back pockets.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: You took this gut out, too, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Lucky for you, you got him in both of his…
well, what we loosely refer to as… hearts.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun
into him.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: That’s the way these people are. You don’t
hit both pumps you just piss them off.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Oh, here’s an extra headshot if you need
one. polariod of dead We’re just about to start cutting in. You’re
welcome to stick around if you want. It’s really fascinating stuff.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s this? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Shouldn’t we examine their personal
effects?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: A rubber. A condom. You know… Coney Island
whitefish? Men, human men, put them on their, uh – penises – to protect
against having babies. get it; Sykes turns You need this for
anything?</p>
<p><strong>ortiz</strong>: Nope, got my own. Anything you guys don’t use
gets stuffed away in storage.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Get the picture?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: And that fits?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well… Yeah, it’s rubber. It stretches.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: And still it fits?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: It is a resin.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil
refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How the hell do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: A large number of my people were hired by
refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse’s
brother is one.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So the Slag they’re cutting into upstairs
worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery. I’d say that
“possible” connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot
more possible. Okay, next step – I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag
store owner blown away last night.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I believe I should interview the widow
alone.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why the hell–?! because of his lack Great,
fine. You talk to the wife.</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: Mr. Hubley was an all right guy – and a damn
good manager. The men liked him. I’m really gonna have to scramble to
fill his shoes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, one of the men didn’t like him so
much…</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: You think this is the guy who did it?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We think he could’a been involved, yeah. You
know him?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: To be honest, it’s hard to say. I hate to
admit it but – they all still kinda look alike to me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Who else can I ask around here?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: Wait. You know who it looks like? Yeah.
Anderson. Uh… James Anderson. He isn’t in today. He took the afternoon
off.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I think you’re gonna find he’s taken the rest
of his life off.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That where Anderson worked?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: Yes it is. come through the Thirty-five
percent pure Methane gas in there. I don’t know how these fellas do
it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jesus. Welcome back Ozzie and Harriet…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband’s
death well.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Did you learn anything?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: A week ago two men came to see her husband.
After they left, he was very frightened. She identified one of the men
from a photo I showed her. It was Hubley.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Aw-right. What about the other guy?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: She didn’t know him. But she said her son
might.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Did you talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: He has not been home since that day. But she
told me where to find him.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: … Our guest speaker tonight has done so much
in his community and for his community in such a short period of time.
And I must say, as the founder of the first Newcomer owned and operated
corporation in Southern California, he certainly has come quite far in
the last few years. Granted, not as far as he came in the years before
reaching Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: As Mayor of this city, it gives me great
pleasure to introduce someone who has so readily made our city his home…
and all of us who live here, his friends. Ladies and gentlemen, William
Harcourt.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Thank you all for that very warm
reception. I’m particularly grateful because I actually had the gall to
write that in my notes: “Thank you all for that very warm reception”.
Imagine how embarrassed I would’ve been if it hadn’t have been such a
warm reception.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: William Harcourt?</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’m Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective
Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Sergeant… Detective. I wasn’t aware there
were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am the first.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Congratulations. This is my administrative
assistant, Rudyard Kipling.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Rudyard Kipling? No shit? Listen, we just
need a minute of your time…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We’d like to ask you about a business
associate of your, Warren Hubley.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
Tragic.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You were partners with him on some Slag – uh,
Newcomer real estate thing.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: That’s right. He and I, along with seven
or eight others. Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any
way I can – unfortunately, at the moment, I’m overdue at another
function.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: William…</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Mr. Mayor…</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: William, I was wondering if you wouldn’t
rather ride with Luisa and me. Two limousines trying to make it across
town in all this traffic, we’re bound to be later than we already
are.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Excellent idea. Ray, I wonder if you know
two of your police officers… Detective Jetson and Sykes.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: A pleasure. We really should be going.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Please feel free to call my office Monday
morning for an appointment. Congratulations again on your promotion,
Detective. Remember… you’re out there setting an example in our
community. I’ll be keeping an eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: That cop, the human, he was the one who
killed Anderson and the driver.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: This is becoming a serious breach of
security.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: He didn’t recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: It is his new partner that I’m worried
about.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Go on ahead. I’ll be right in. What’d you dig
up for me?</p>
<p><strong>maffet</strong>: You said you wanted the biggest thing I
could find… Well, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>maffet</strong>: Casull .454 Magnum. You’re talking twice the
impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Only holds five.</p>
<p><strong>maffet</strong>: Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an
cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don’t need but one.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No… two.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, let’s see what you got, Cochise. Gimme
six, rapid fire.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How long you been shooting? That’s pitiful.
Whattya gonna do if somebody draws down on you, wave your scores on the
written exam at ’em?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why’d I do what?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Agree to work with me? You don’t like me…
you don’t like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us. And yet
you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your
partner…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: My partner is dead! Because one of you
bastards killed him – then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown,
where he’s home and dry, ’cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says
nothing…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: But he didn’t figure on you, George. You’re
going to get me through that wall of silence. You’re going to make them
talk to me. You’re going to help me find that Slag son-of-a- bitch.
Comprendo? And if Fedorchuk and the boys in the bullpen don’t like it,
screw them… and if the Captain doesn’t like it, screw him… and if all
the Slags down in Slagtown don’t like it… well screw them too!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Okay, just stay back and do what I do. Watch
and learn, watch and learn…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I can’t see dick in here.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Which one’a you Slags is Porter?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: At the end of the bar.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: My name is Sykes. I’m–</p>
<p><strong>alien voice</strong>: Ss’ai k’ss?</p>
<p><strong>offender</strong>: Careful, ss’loka’, you might hurt
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You Porter?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: No, Matthew. I believe this is the one you
want.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Your name wouldn’t happen to be Porter, would
it?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Uh, Matthew…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Back off, George.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: But I– .</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’ll handle it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jesus, are the questions too tough for you
already? Let’s try again– Is your name Porter?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Ss’kya’ta’.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Screw me? That can’t be right.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Ss’kya ta’ ss’loka’. Ss’trokya’ ss’lato
na’!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Your mother mates out of season.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That’s very colorful. But see – now I’ve got
a problem. I don’t seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.
So I guess we’re gonna have to take this little session down to my
office, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Matthew, you don’t have to– .</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Stay back! I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Don’t they teach you anything about us in
cop school, little ss’loka’?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Ss’tangya T’ssorentsa’. You’re a cop. It
fits you.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You know that guy?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: From quarantine, when my people first
arrived here. He and I were housed together.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick
a roommate like him?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.
The selection process was entirely random. We did not get to stay with
our friends… or families…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You don’t know what your father and these
two men were arguing about?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I told you – I was in the back of the store.
I just heard voices, muffled like.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: One of the two men was Hubley, right? What
about the other one? Did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Yeah… I seen him around. High- roller dude
named Strader. Joshua Strader. Runs a club on the west side.
Encounters.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, I heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: That’s all I know. You want anything more,
you ask somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am sorry about your father.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: If I may make a suggestion… We have
different weak spots than you do. Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus
under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, sure. I knew that…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Six forty-two.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I don’t think I could ever learn to read that
shit. How long did it take you to learn English?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Three months. We learn quickly. We adapt. It
is our strength… what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile
environments.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: My neighbor’s kid has a Newcomer girl in his
class. She’s six years old and in seventh grade already…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Oh, God. I think I got yours here…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Which one is that? Raw what?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: This is mole. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’ll bet. Would it really put you out if they
tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients
if the food has been cooked.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Oh, that’s real attractive. You got fur in
your teeth, George. Come on, man, we’re gonna be talking to people…
jeez.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So what was that other word for Human… Slow
ka?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Ss’loka’. It means literally “small but
intelligent creature”. doesn’t know if he It loses much in the
translation.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: And what was that one about my mother? That
was a good one.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Ss’trokya ss’lato ‘na’.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, that’s it. Say it slow.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You are Cassandra?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We are with the Police Department. This is
Sergeant Sykes, and I am–</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Ss’ai k’ss? Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We’re looking for your boss – Strader.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: He’s not here. Why ask me?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: The young woman at the front said you might
know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: She did, did she? Well, she was wrong.
Excuse me, I have to change.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Look, we’re not here doing an interview for
the school paper. This is a homicide investigation… and if you don’t
stop jerkin’ us around, I’m ready to start playin’ hardball.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Oooh. Hardball. That sounds interesting.
Are you going to strike me? You could tie me up and then do whatever you
want with me… I’ve got my own ropes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Does that cost extra or you throw them
in?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: You’ve got me all wrong. I don’t charge
money for something that I myself find pleasurable…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am going out to the car. I will meet you
there.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Look, I don’t know where Mr. Strader
might be. He comes and he goes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: The girl out front mentioned Strader’s
assistant, somebody named Watson. Maybe he knows.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Todd? Todd doesn’t know either.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: I know… Why don’t you hang around for a
while, let me entertain you? It’s Matt, right? Now tell me the truth,
have you ever… made it… with one of us?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told
me about it later.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: A virgin. I find that very arousing…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: There’s lots of things I haven’t done, but
his ain’t high on the list. Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: I think you’re just a little scared now,
about what you might find once the lights go out. A little scared… and a
lot curious. Maybe more than you want to admit. But doesn’t that turn
you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together? Think of it as
broadening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I like my horizons narrow.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Your voice is saying no, but your body is
saying yes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: My voice, body, and everything else is saying
I’ll be back in two hours for Strader, and he better damn well be
here.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Todd, it’s me. The police were just here…
looking for Strader. And asking about you.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Freeze! Now!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Fire escape! End of the hall!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’ll be damned. It worked. How’d you like
that, huh? Whammo! Both barrels. Dropped him like a bag of cement.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Todd Watson. The assistant manager.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t believe this. Look at my suit. Look
at what you made me do to my car.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Your girlfriend put up a better fight than
you did, pal.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We are looking for your employer, Joshua
Strader.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: He’s out of town.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Why did you run?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Because you two were chasing me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: When will Strader return?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Who knows. He’s the boss – he doesn’t have
to check in with me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Watson… this is my partner here’s first
coupla days, and he wants to make a good impression. Me, though, the way
I feel – this could be my last day, know what I mean? And I’m ready to
rain on you like a cow pissin’ on a flat rock.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look – Mr. Strader hasn’t been around for a
coupla days. He didn’t tell me where he was going or when he’d be back.
I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I believe he is probably lying.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Through his ass. Next time you see him, tell
him to call me… unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad
case of herpes.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George, you can handle the women from now on,
you mind?</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: Okay, scrape him up.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Any progress?</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: My arm’s gettin’ tired and so far, zip.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: He is ss’verdlatya ss’alo to Strader.</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: Duty-bonded. His allegiance to Strader is
above pain or life.</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: You tellin’ me this guy would die before he’d
screw his boss and work for us? Nobody’s that dumb.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: It is something you couldn’t comprehend,
Quint.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: I understand you have been resisting my
offer Mr. Watson. Your sense of duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but – no
longer an issue, I’m afraid…</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: I will not make this offer again. I want
you to work for me, to manage the nightclub as Strader’s successor. If
you do, you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared
imagine…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Sss’k’a ta’!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: It is such a pity to die for an outmoded
value. Mr. Quint, I believe it’s time for our friend’s swimming
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: It’s important to learn new skills.
Essential to your growth as a person.</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: You never seen this before, have you, Billy?
oh, man, you ain’t gonna believe it… seawater is like battery acid to
these guys… I don’t know what it is, some kinds chemical reaction.
Whatta you think it is, Watson? Whoa, hold him. outside, the foam What I
love about the surf is you can never tell how far up it’s going to come
until it… whoops, got a little wet there.</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: Last call, sucker. One… two…</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: When we picked him up, he was talking to
those two cops – the two who came to question you about Hubley.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: This is getting out of hand. I want you to
deal with it. Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: We must learn to embrace the things we
fear… and from that grow strong.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash,
does she?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: My wife? She worries about me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah… I know the routine.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You are married?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Was. Divorced.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We mate for life. Divorce… is a strange
concept to us.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: It’s like having an eleventh finger removed.
It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Your home is quite disordered. I thought
perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I appreciate your honesty, George.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Ignore the bitch on the left, that’s Edie. I
call her Edi Amin… This is Kristin, my daughter. It’s kinda an old
picture… she’s twenty now. Getting married, in fact… on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Human children can be very beautiful.
Getting married? Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off,
then…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Maybe not… I don’t know. I’m not sure I’m
gonna go. She doesn’t need her burn-out of a father there…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I must show you… shows four crisp And this
is Richard. My son. He’s four years old. We named him after the former
President, Richard Nixon.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You open to a piece of advice? Tell people
you named him after Richard Burton, the actor. Just take my word for
it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: … and so, and so the doctor says, “If this is
the thermometer, then where’d I leave the pen?” Jetson doesn’t You’re
not… you don’t think that’s funny? George, work with me, I always get a
laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor’s got the thermometer in his
hand, then where’s his pen gotta be?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: In the other man’s rectum.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Sticking out of his ass… yeah! See, that’s
what makes it a joke. There’s like a surprise, and your mind fills in
the funny picture. Here’s this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he
thinks it’s a thermometer. Nada, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Your health…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Ta ss’trakyona’…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: There is so much our two peoples don’t
understand about each other.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No shit, Holmes. You’re only from another
goddamn planet, for chrissakes.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You humans are very curious to us. You
invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we’ve never
known before. You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of
freedoms and opportunities… You give us ownership of our lives for the
first time… and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live
by the rules… rules that aren’t made to keep one people subordinate to
another, but rules that exist to preserve equality. You aspire to very
high ideals here.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I hope you can understand how special your
world is… how unique a people you humans are. So it us all the more
painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up
the the ideals you set for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Don’t count on me, George. I never had any
ideals.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We don’t understand the hatred, the
contempt. But we must bear it… we must not react in anger… because our
situation here is still fragile. The separationists would see us
returned to the quarantine camps. The fundamentalists say we have no
more human rights than dogs or cats. But the prejudice we face here is
so insignificant compared to the pain that we’ve known before. And that
is why we are so grateful.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, well… except I did hear you eat your
dead.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Only on Fridays.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch. You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You do sleep,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What a wildman…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: This better be good news or money.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Hold this. I feel very terrible.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Where’d you get this?!!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: A man, a human, was wiring it to your car. I
didn’t get a good look at him. that it’s day; I must call my wife…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: She’s going to divorce me.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George, she’s not gonna divorce you. You mate
for life, remember?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: She’s very progressive. I’m certain she’s
considering it.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: You guys are looking for somebody named
Strader, right?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned in.
They found him. Or at least what’s left of him, washed up on the beach
at Zuma.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: over the message They’re still there if
you wanna catch them.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, let’s roll, George.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: To the… to the beach?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Come on, let’s go, dude. Surf’s up!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Please, I must get out here.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Come on, you won’t have to get near the
water.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Stop the car!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: All right, okay. Keep your pantyhose on.
Jeez, when in doubt, freak out, for chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: It’s all right, George. It’s cool. Just wait
here, all right? I’ll be back in a coupla minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Found his wallet in his jacket pocket.
Joshua Strader, big as life.</p>
<p><strong>coroner’s tech</strong>: Jesus, what a mess. It’s gonna be a
bear to make a positive determination, but it looks to me like he was
shot before being tossed in the drink. At least twice– hearts would’ve –
here, and here.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How’re you two doing on Tuggle’s killer?</p>
<p><strong>alterez</strong>: The store owner’s son is in a street gang,
so now we’re thinking maybe it’s gang related.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah, that’s real good. You guys follow up on
that for a coupla months.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Look at your dildo partner. He’s too
scared to even come down to the sand. even though he’s too You’re not
gonna get wet standing here, moron!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I’d like to see you next to a sea of
hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk… see how much surfin’ you’d do.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: Well, if it isn’t Detective Jetson.
Forget you hip waders, big guy?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Lay off, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>fedorchuk</strong>: I may be an asshole, but at least I’m a
real detective, not some outer shit space thing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah? you’re a real honest-to-god
detective…?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Then detect these!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: … So we’ve got three guys dead. All
Newcomers, all killed the same way – execution style.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Warren Hubley was in middle management at a
refinery… Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: … and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop
mini-mart. So what the hell’s the connection?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You guys finished the postmortem on Strader
yet?</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: You mean the Blob? They’re finishing up
now.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Is Bentner here? I must speak with him.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: He went home early – his kid was sick.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Yeah, but he left something for you.</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Does this have something to do with the test
he ran that he wouldn’t tell me about?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What kind of test?</p>
<p><strong>winter</strong>: Looking for some foreign compound in the
blood of that alien you dropped the other day.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Did he find anything?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: It is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s this nothing shit? It wasn’t nothing
yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he
was about to shit peach pits, and it’s not nothing now. Don’t lie to me,
George, you’re bad at it.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You must leave me alone on this.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No, see, I don’t leave you alone… I’m your
partner. I don’t work that way… Tug didn’t work that way.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No secrets, goddammit! You don’t hold back
from me. Whatever is going on, you’re gonna tell me now!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: No. I cannot involve you. This is not your
concern.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: The hell it isn’t, when somebody wires up
enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist! That Slag was
on something, and not sour milk, either? Am I right? to the wall by
sheer TELL ME! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: … It is called ss’jabroka’. To us it is a
potent narcotic.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How potent?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Like your cocaine, I suppose. The “high”
lasts several hours. We would receive small amounts of it… as a reward
for our labor.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We? You’ve taken it?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We all did.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Where did he get it? Was there any of it on
the ship?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: No… I am sure not. That is why I am so
concerned… someone must now be producing it here. But none of my people
know how to make it. The process was carefully guarded.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jesus, this is major. Why didn’t you tell me
sooner? Why’d you hold out on me?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Your people don’t know about this part of
out past. And they can’t know – It would threaten our entire existence
here.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George… look me in the eye… George, you don’t
ever lie to me again.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot stop
this without you.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George? How about you drive…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: There’s gotta be some other connection.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Here’s Hubley. Left Quarantine on November
thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early
in February the following year. Field of expertise: chemical
manufacturing. Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs
waiting for that one at the refinery.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin’?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: For you, anything.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Released on November twenty-ninth. Came
immediately to L.A. Ten weeks after arriving he took over the abandoned
club which is now Encounters.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Now the store owner, please. Cecil
Porter.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Released December one. He and his wife
moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California – wherever that is –
settled in L.A. in April. Field of expertise: organic chemical
engineering. He and his wife have one child, a son.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Yeah – we met him. Wonderful boy… close
personal friend of George’s here.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’m sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems to be
matching up…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Holy shit… Look what we’re staring at: three
Newcomers with nothing in common, right? What if it’s just one other guy
who killed these three? Three and one make four. Four Newcomers… of
totally different backgrounds… You and the store owner’s son – that
punker!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: … Quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Can you dig up their Quarantine records in
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sure. Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Quite lovely… What is your name again?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: involuntarily at Cassandra.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: I will have to remember that…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: They had months in quarantine to develop the
plan. Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up
with the formula for the drug. Hubley manufactured it – at the refinery.
Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network. And
Harcourt–</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Harcourt was the brain who brought it all
together.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Okay, George – we gotta play this real
smart.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: If the drug is here, we must destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: No, George – you’re missing the point. The
drug is evidence. We need to have the evidence, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: That’s the guy…</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: Hey, what are you, crazy?! You can’t come in
here like this! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: So much for playing it smart…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Is that it…?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Uh, George…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Where is the drug? Where have they taken
it?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: What drug? This is an oil refinery, you…</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: You… can’t do… this!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George, uh… you’re gonna break his little
chest bones…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Stay out of this, Matthew. Tell me where the
drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Don’t piss him off, O’Neal. When he gets like
this, I can’t control him. I’ve seen this before. He got like this once
– I saw him jerk a guy’s spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could
do. I hadda go throw up.</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: … They took the stuff out, all of it – this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: About fifty kilos… of concentrate… and some
street grade… in tubes.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Where have they taken it?</p>
<p><strong>o’neal</strong>: Encount… Encounters Club.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George, c’mon – lighten up. It’s a beauty of
a case. Don’t sweat it – we got him by the short hairs. He ain’t gonna
make any more of the shit.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to find it.
I can’t let it get out on the street.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why? What’s the big goddamn deal?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Jetson starts the car You destroy that drug,
you destroy the case. Don’t blow the whole thing now by not following
procedure.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Fuck procedure.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Hey!!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Police. Get out. I need this thing. Out,
now!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: I am here to take Harcourt. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: In there.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: It’s been a long time, hasn’t it,
gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>human dealer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: A sweet indulgence from out past…
resurrected for our future.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Please feel free to sample the quality.
The experience will be everything you remember it to be…</p>
<p><strong>alien dealer</strong>: Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: I arranged to spend some time with three
very resourceful men. With a certain amount of coaxing, one of them was
able to reconstitute the formula for me. They worked very well together.
Unfortunately, they are no longer with us… but I was fortunate enough to
reap the benefit of their endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>human dealer</strong>: Let me try some. immediately spits
Jesus! Tastes like detergent!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: And that’s all the effect it will have on
you. But when my fellow Newcomers learn they can obtain it here, they
will work very hard… to make as much money as they can… to give it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You haven’t told him all of it.</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: He’s got the C-4 charge!</p>
<p><strong>quint</strong>: Just take it real casual, buddy. Keep your
finger on that button and don’t do nothing squirrely.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: If you release that button, you not only
kill us, but yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: To get you and that– – I would do it.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Everyone up against that wall. Very slowly.
Except you.</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: One small matter seems to have escaped
your attention. That– – is not on any books as a controlled substance.
Legally it might as well be fifty kilos of… grape jelly.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: The charge is murder… and conspiracy to
commit murder. Hubley, Porter, Strader… probably others.</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: You… you killed Strader?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Where’s Todd?! Did you do something to
Todd?!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Todd? Who is Todd. Ah, poor
Mr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: I got it!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Kill them both.</p>
<p><strong>kipling</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Do it!</p>
<p><strong>alien dealer</strong>: Don’t shoot, man – we’re unarmed –
look!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>cassandra</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Slow traffic on your right… you’re clear at
the left rear… Careful, red light ahead…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Yellow light ahead turning red…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Red light! Red light!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Green light, Matthew. Green light!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Ss-ai!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Move your goddamned cars!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Move a finger, Harcourt, and you’re
history…</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: No, Sergeant – not history… Eternity…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you
will be requesting reassignment now.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: It’d be for your own good. I think you’d be
better off with a partner who’s a little more… by the book. … Still, I
gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you’re sure hell on wheels once
you get going. I’d kinda hate to miss your next two days as a
detective.</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: I’ll give you guys a lift to the station.
They’re waiting to take your statements on the shootings.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Let’s go, partner. correcting Wiltey And it’s
shooting. Singular.</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: They said two.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nope. I didn’t shoot Harcourt… he o.d.’d.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: So it’s just me and her left in the hot tub,
right?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You and the blonde?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No, man, the redhead. The blonde’s gone in
the house with some other guy. But a few minutes later she comes back
out, alone, when me and the redhead are going at it fast and furious in
the tub, ya know… and she sees us, and… she climbs right in with us…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You’re full of shit!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I swear it! If I’m lyin’, I’m dyin’…</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You are certain this is the route they would
have taken?</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: I’m not positive – but probably.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What’s this about, George? I know that
look.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: There! Go back. Down that side street.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: No! We must do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Do what?! George– ?!</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: I’m calling for back up, now.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Wiltey, no.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What is this?!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: … It’s Harcourt.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Harcourt is dead.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: No he’s not. Not if he overdosed on the
drug. Massive amounts trigger a… a change. Your body functions seize up,
you appear to be dead, but it’s really a state of incubation. When you
emerge you’re…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: bodies sprawled Tell me about it…</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I never thought I’d say this, but – for once
in my life I think I’m willing to wait for back-up.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: We can’t let him get away.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Why the hell are you so dead set against
back-up?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Because… because of what will happen if
humans see what we are capable of becoming.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: But there’s no more drug.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You understand that. But how many others
will?</p>
<p><strong>wiltey</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Wiltey!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt</strong>: Looking for me, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: On that boat – out there!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Take it down! Take it down!</p>
<p><strong>harcourt’s head breaks the surface a foot from
sykes’</strong>: FACE. His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone. The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes, breaking his
grip from Jetson’s, and dragging him under again.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: Take it up!</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: What the hell was that down there? It was
weird.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Looked like every other damn slag to me. Just
plain ugly.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: You look very good.</p>
<p><strong>kristin</strong>: Ready, Daddy…?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: George, uh… I want to apologize now, in
advance, for all the rotten things I’ll ever say or do to you over the
years.</p>
<p><strong>jetson</strong>: That is all right, Matthew. After all, you
are only human.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: What a wildman…</p>
