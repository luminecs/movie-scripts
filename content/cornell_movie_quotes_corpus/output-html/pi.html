<h1 id="pi">pi</h1>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Monday, September first. Six-fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The alchemist awakes. “Turn lead into gold,
Max, lead into gold.” Today, I find it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Heat’s been getting to Euclid. Feel it most in
the afternoon when I run the set. Have to keep the fans on all night
from now on. Otherwise, everything is running topnotch. The stack of
286’s is now faster than Columbia’s computer science department. I spent
a couple hundred dollars. Columbia’s cost? Half a million? Ha…</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Max, Max! Can we do one?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Jenna! Jenna!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: What’s three hundred and twenty-two times
four hundred and ninety-one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: One hundred fifty-eight thousand, a hundred
two. Right?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Jenna…</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Okay, seventy-three divided by
twenty-two.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Three point three one eight one eight one
eight…</p>
<p><strong>ext. chinatown - day</strong>: Max watches people bustle
through the busy intersections of Chinatown. The streets are clogged
with people.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Somewhere in there. Somewhere. I know it’s
right in front of me. The pattern. They say it’s chaos, it can’t be
understood, too much complexity.</p>
<p><strong>ext. electronic megadump - day</strong>: Max scavenges
electronic parts as he carefully navigates an endless dump for old and
rotting computers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: History it’s there. Lurking, shaping.
structuring, hiding, right beneath the surface.</p>
<p><strong>move in</strong>: on Max looking up at something as he
reclines on a public bench.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and
wane of Caribou populations in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, the rise and
fall of the Nile and yes! the New York Stock Exchange, they are all the
same.</p>
<p><strong>move in</strong>: on a tree branch - shaking gently in the
wind.</p>
<p><strong>slow dissolve to extreme close-up of stock ticker</strong>:
Bright stock quotes drift across the screen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll find this structure, this order, this
perfection.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s apartment - day</strong>: Max stares intensely at
the ticker on the small TV that sits next to his monitors.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Turn lead into gold. The first. Right here.
Right here. With math. The numbers of the stock market are my lead. When
I find the pattern, then I will find gold.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Maximilian Cohen, please.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Mr. Cohen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hi. my name is Marcy Dawson. I’m a
partner with the predictive strategy firm Lancet-Percy. Can I speak with
Mr. Cohen, please?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I told you…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen! How are you? It’s been a
long time. Sorry I haven’t been in touch. But I was hoping you would
allow me to take you to lunch tomorrow, say one o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sorry, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: We’re very anxious to talk with you,
sir</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: I’m prepared to make you a
generous…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t take offers for my research. You know
that. Sorry, I Couldn’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen, give me a moment…</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Max, good!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hi, Devi.</p>
<p><strong>dev1</strong>: I grabbed you some somosas.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Your hair.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Your hair, you can’t go out like that. Don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s fine. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: You need a mom.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Your somosas!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lancet-percy 86% accuracy .</strong>: Max flips the page
before he or we can absorb it. He compares stock quotes in the Wall
Street Journal against his printout.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid shows
tomorrow’s Dow closing up by four points. Anomalies include PRONET at
sixty-fire and a quarter, a career high. Possible explanations, either
A, an error in the June fifth algorithm, or B, Euclid’s main processor
is running a recursion…</p>
<p><strong>voice from offscreen</strong>: Oh sorry, am I bothering
you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: I’ll put it out. The name’s Lenny
Meyer</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Cohen! Jewish? Max shrugs and turns
back to his work.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: It’s okay. I’m a Jew, too. Do you
practice?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I’m not interested in religion.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Have you ever heard of Kabbalah?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Jewish mysticism.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m very busy.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: I understand…it’s just that it’s a very
exciting time in our history. Right now is a critical moment in
time.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yes, it’s very exciting. Have you ever
put on Tefillin?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Tefillin. You know Tefillin. I know it
looks strange. But it’s an amazing tradition that has a tremendous
amount of power. It’s a mitzvah for all Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs, good
deeds, are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: They purify us and bring us closer to
God. You want to try it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I gotta go…</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Are you okay? Max? Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry, bye.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Well, maybe some other time.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s bathroom - night</strong>: Max splashes water on
his face.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Please God, Let it be a small one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sixteen thirty-five. Second headache in under
twenty-four hours. They’re getting more frequent now…more painful, too.
Drugs don’t work, just take the edge off of it. Just gotta wait for the
nosebleed. Relief comes from my nose.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: So I gotta make this drop off in Harlem
and on the way down there’s these three kids hailing me.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: You stopped?</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: I was tight, so…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ahh…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: So I drop them off in the Village and they
dart.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: I get out, grab my bat and start running.
One of the kids, maybe sixteen, I catch a block later he’s cursing at
me, calling me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him, right in the head.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Farrouhk!</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: I’m kicking the bastard in the ribs
banging his ass, knocking his head against the curb, harder and harder,
I fucking lost it. A hot dog guy starts screaming “You’re cracking his
skull, you’re cracking his skull.” So they pulled me off of him and
calmed me down. Cops said he had it coming to him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - dawn</strong>: A phone rings incessantly.
Max’s eyes pop open. He’s scrunched up in a corner of the room, squashed
beneath the sink.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen. Marcy Dawson here again I
was just looking over my schedule and I realized I’ll be in your
neighborhood tomorrow around three.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who is…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Marcy Dawson from Lancet-Percy I’m so
anxious to meet you. It will be worth it�for both of us I promise. See
you at your house at three, okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My house…how do…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Oh, don’t worry, I got your address
from Columbia. So three it is. Looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>s0l</strong>: Max! How are you7</p>
<p><strong>ext. sol’s study - moments later</strong>: TIGHT ON the
Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white and Max is black. Sol’s
moves are secure and controlled while Max is hesitant.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Stop thinking, Max, just feel. Use your
intuition. It’s the only way to get into the flow. What did you think of
Hamlet?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t get to it.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: It’s been a month. You haven’t taken a single
break.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m so close, Sol. I’m so close but I just
can’t grab it.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Have you met the new fish my niece bought me? I
named her Icarus. After you. My renegade pupil. You fly too high, you’ll
get burned.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: The more I see you, the more I see myself
thirty years ago. My greatest pupil. Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: But life isn’t just mathematics. I spent forty
years looking for patterns in Pi, I found nothing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You found things…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I found things, but not a pattern.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tuesday, September second, eighteen twelve. If
Sol hadn’t gotten sick who knows where math would be. He spent years in
the numbers of Pi. Searching for meaning, for order.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Three point one four…off into infinity and
maybe insanity. Somewhere in there he wanted sanity. Sanity like he
found in the circles Pi represented. Simple, sane circles. If only the
stock market had circles. Some type of sanity. Some type of form, of
shape.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Hey, Max, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Lenny Meyer. I’ll put it out. So, what
do you do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Um, I work with computers …math.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Really? What type of math?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Number theory. Mostly research.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Number theory? No way, I work in
theory, too. Not traditional, though… I work with the Torah.
Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yeah. You know Hebrew is all numbers.
It’s all math.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Here, look…the ancient Jews used Hebrew
as their numerical system. Each letter is a number.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You see…The Hebrew “A,” the number 1.
The Hebrew “B,” Bet, is two. You can take any Hebrew text and turn them
into a long string of numbers.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: The Torah is just a long string of
numbers. Some say that it’s a long code sent to us from God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Kind of interesting.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yeah, like take the Hebrew word for,
say, the Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf, Dalei Mem…Kuf is a hundred. Daled,
four Mem, forty. They equal one hundred and forty-four. Then take the
tree of knowledge…in the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it equals two hundred and
thirty-three. Now you can take that number and…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’re Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The Fibonacci sequence. Italian mathematician,
thirteenth century. If you divide a hundred and forty-four into two
hundred and thirty-three, it approaches theta.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Theta?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The Greek symbol for the golden ratio. The
golden spiral.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You’re right, I never saw that before.
That’s the series you find in nature. Like the face of a sunflower.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wherever there’s spirals.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You see, there’s math everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: MAX’S POV of smoke spirals spinning in
front of him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Math everywhere…</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Max looks down at his coffee cup. He
pours cream into his coffee. It shoots up and mixes with the black
coffee forming spirals in the mug.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Everywhere…</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Max looks at the spiral he just drew on
the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Simple shapes! Tuesday, September second.
Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol! Sol! Shapes in the market. Why not? And
they’re spirals! Spirals!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: A circle spread out overtime. It’s open-ended.
It has a beginning and it grows and changes through time. If I can find
where it fits, if I can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers,
then I can calculate the future. Lead into gold. Chaos into order
Madness into sanity. Pain into bliss. Perfection.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>tight on a fuse box</strong>: Max removes a fuse. He replaces
it with a penny.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>ext. playground - day</strong>: TIGHT ON a tree branch
shaking manically in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wednesday, September third, seven-fifteen.
Results: AAR at fourteen and a half�low, very low. ABR at six and a
half�jeez. Six and a half, ABR hasn’t been beneath twenty in ten years.
Conclusion: Simple. There is no pattern. No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all
chaos.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Euclid crashed. I lost all my data, my
hardware.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Your mainframe?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Burnt…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know, first I got these horrible picks.
Then Euclid spits out some numbers. Never saw anything like it and then
it fries. The whole machine just crashed.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You have a printout?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Of?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: The picks, the number?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I threw it out.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What was the number it spit out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know, just a long string of digits.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What was it, a hundred and fifty, a thousand,
two hundred sixteen!? How many?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know. Probably around two hundred.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: … I dealt with some bugs back in my Pi days. I
was wondering if it was similar to one I ran into.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Have you met Archimedes. The one with the black
spot. You see?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Remember Archimedes of Syracuse? The King asks
Archimedes to determine if a present he’s received was actually solid
gold. Unsolved problem at the time. It tortures the great Greek
mathematician for weeks. Insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns on
his bed for nights on end. Finally, his equally exhausted wife, she’s
forced to share a bed with this genius, convinces him to take a bath, to
relax. While stepping into the tub he observes the bathwater rise as he
enters. Displacement. A way to determine volume. And thus, a way to
determine density, weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the
problem. He screams “Eureka!”�Greek for “I found it!”�and is so
overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the King’s
castle to report his discovery. Now, what’s the moral of the story.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That a breakthrough will come…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Wrong. The point of the story is the wife.
Listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. Meaning, you need a
break, Max, you have to take a bath, otherwise you’ll get nowhere. There
will be no order, only chaos. Go home and take a bath.</p>
<p><strong>public bench - moments later</strong>: Max waits for his
train on an empty platform.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey, excuse me, can I see that?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Six and a half.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fourteen and a half. Oh, my…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My God. My God. Yes! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>skinny man</strong>: Hey, paper, please!</p>
<p><strong>at grand street</strong>: Max exits. He notices that the
Skinny Man gets off - one car down - as well.</p>
<p><strong>ext. train station - day</strong>: He seems to have lost him,
when he notices a business-woman with a pretty face heading right toward
him. It is MARCY</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: I was just waiting for you. I thought
you stood me up, so I was going to head home.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Oh…Marcy Dawson. From Lancet Percy. We
were supposed to meet at three.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: I can’t tell you what a pleasure it is
to finally meet you. I’ve studied your papers for years.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: I have something you won’t be able to
say no to. Why don’t we take a spin in the limo?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, no, no, really, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: We’re excited by your work. We can’t
wait to discuss…</p>
<p><strong>int. bodega - day</strong>: Max barrels into the grocery
store and buys a Journal. He heads to the back of the store and lays the
paper across the juice section. He checks the listing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: On the nose. On the damn nose.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Farrouhk?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Um, no, it’s Max from next door.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Max, is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you have any iodine?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Iodine…did you cut yourself?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. I just need it to stain a slide.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Ah, science, the pursuit of knowledge. One
second.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Here we are. What are you examining� a
potato!?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just something with my computer.</p>
<p><strong>max’s room - moments later</strong>: Max uses his pinky to
drip a drop of iodine on the slide.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: The neighbor’s up to his old science…</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: What neighbor?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Next door.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Why are you talking to that dork!</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Shh! I just helped …</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Pounds on wall. Hey, dork, leave my
girlfriend alone!</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Farrouhk!</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Shh! C’mon, Farrouhk.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: I’ll kill the dork. You hear me! I’ll kill
you. I’ll fucking kill you!</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Shh! Baby! Come here, baby!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I just threw out something. I didn’t realize I
needed it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: Humph.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Just a printout. I, uh, lost my data…</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Max! How you doing? Lenny Meyer.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, hey…</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Hey, where you going? You got a few
moments to do Tefillin?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: I gotta car, we can cruise over to
my…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You gotta car?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yeah, right there. That’s Ephraim, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: All tight, lets go.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lenny, I don’t really want to do…</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Do it for me? It means a lot, having
someone of your stature performing a mitzvah in my presence. When you
told me your name was Max Cohen, I didn’t realize you were the Max
Cohen. Maximilian Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You know me?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: 0f course, I’ve followed your research
since your Columbia days. It’s revolutionary. You’ve inspired the work
we do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I have?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yes, very much so. The only difference
is, we’re not looking at stocks. We’re searching for a pattern in
Torah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What kind of pattern?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: We’re not really sure. Our calculations
have shown us that there is a number encoded in the text.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What sort of number?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: We don’t know. All we know is that it’s
two hundred and sixteen digits long.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Don’t worry. This one just goes over
your head.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two sixteen?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Yes. Now we have to say a small prayer,
repeat after me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: That’s it. Wasn’t so bad, was it? You
feel anything?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: It’s a prayer about our dedication to
our one and only God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I mean the number, the two sixteen number?
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Oh. We don’t know. We just know that
it’s the most common number encoded in the text. It might be some type
of linguistic pattern. If we could figure out what the number is we
could maybe answer that.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s going on, Sol!?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Relax, it’s early.</p>
<p><strong>int. sol’s kitchen - moments later</strong>: Max sits at the
kitchen table while Sol heats up a pot of tea. Max is shaking.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Now, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s the two hundred and sixteen number,
Sol?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You asked me if I had seen a two hundred and
sixteen digit number, right?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Oh, you mean the bug. I found it working on
Pi.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do you mean by “found it”?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: What’s this all about, Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, there’s these religious Jews who
have…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Religious Jews?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, you know, Hassidim. I met one in the
coffee shop. The guy’s a number theorist. The Torah is their data set.
The thing is, they’re searching for a two hundred and sixteen digit
number in the Torah.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Really? What’s it mean to them?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They say they don’t know, but that’s crazy. I
mean what are the odds…</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: It’s just a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But hold on, there’s something else. You
remember those strange picks I got.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Yesterday’s stock picks?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right. Well, it turns out that they were
correct. I hit two picks on the nose. Smack on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Something’s going on, and it has to do with
that number. The answer is there.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Max, it’s a bug.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. it’s a pattern. A pattern is in that
number</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>int. sol’s study - moments later</strong>: Sol and Max sit on
either side of a half-played Go board.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered
the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is
empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of
game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been
alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an
extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world,
Max. It can’t be easily summed up with math. There is no simple
pattern.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities
become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all
moves are predictable.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, maybe, even though we’re not sophisticated
enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order…a pattern,
beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the
market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: That is insanity, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Or maybe it’s genius. I have to get that
number.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Hold on, you have to slow down. You’re losing
it, you have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You’re connecting a
computer bug I had, a computer bug you might have had, and some
religious hogwash. If you want to find the number two sixteen in the
world, you’ll be able to pull it out of anywhere. Two hundred and
sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door. Two hundred and
sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes
obsessed with anything, it will filter everything else out and find
examples of that thing everywhere. Three hundred and twenty, four
hundred and fifty, twenty-three. Whatever! You’ve chosen two sixteen and
you’ll find it everywhere in nature. But Max, as soon as you discard
scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. You become a
numerologist. What you need to do is take a break from your research.
You need it. You deserve it Here’s a hundred dollars, I want you to take
it. If ,you won’t take it, borrow it. Either way, take a break. Spend it
however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation. Real
world stuff, okay. No math.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Just try it. In a week you’ll laugh about this.
C’mon, Max. Think about it!</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen? Mr. Cohen? Please stop for
a second Mr. Cohen?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Damn it already! Stop following me. I’m not
interested in your money. I’m searching for a way to understand our
world. I’m searching for perfection. I don’t deal with mediocre
materialistic people like you!</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m very sorry. I admit
I’ve been a bit too aggressive. But all I ask is for five minutes of
your time. Here…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: …a stopwatch. Already ticking. Allow
me the four and a half minutes left Let me tell you what I want. Let me
tell you what I can offer you. Afterwards, if you don’t want to talk to
me, then fine, we part as friends and I promise that you will never see
me again. That’s fair, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Good. It’s funny, even though we have
different aims and different goals we’re actually incredibly alike. We
both seek the same thing�perfection. I know… clearly we’re seeking
different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect
candidates for a fruitful partnership. If you let me, I can be your
greatest ally. Take the acacia tree…in East Africa. It is the most
prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its
niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. To accomplish this,
the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree
has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for
shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the
tree’s leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge
out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe’s tongue. The giraffe learns
its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be
picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun
Both would die. But with each other, they succeed, they survive, they
surpass. They have different aims, different goals but they work
together. Max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance
with you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Allow me to dose.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: As a sign of good faith we wish to
offer you this.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I told you I don’t want money.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: The suitcase isn’t filled with fifties
or gold or diamonds. Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ming Mecca. They’re not declassified.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: You’re right. They’re not. But
Lancet-Percy has many friends. Come here, take a look.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do…do…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Beautiful, isn’t it? You know how
rare…are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I got to go.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: But what about…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let me think about it…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: What? Mr. Cohen!?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>blinding white void</strong>: We hear two deep, long
sleep-filled breaths and then we CUT</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop.</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Your nose.</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s apartment - night</strong>: MAX’S POV through the
microscope. Max sees the brain structures.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Max, Max, can we do one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jenna. I can’t now, Jenna.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Please, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m working now, later okay?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Hello, this is Lenny?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Lenny, it’s Max Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Max! How are you? You want to come
down?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ve been thinking about our conversation
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: That’s good…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I want to help.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you have the Torah in digital form?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thursday, September fourth, sixteen forty-five.
The alchemist awakes. All of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning
together It all has to do with spirals. It began with spirals and the
answers are thee.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The most I can remember about their
significance is from Schneider’s class. That bullshit core for majors.
Schneider’s fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a
quack…but…then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The
leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be
represented by numbers. Pythagoras’ greatest contribution was the golden
ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of
years, arguably all the way up to today.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The golden ratio, if I recall, is this unique
relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called
the golden rectangle.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If you take the width of this rectangle and use
it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a
rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can
continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the
rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Then, if you connect a curve through these
rectangles you get the golden spiral. The Pythagoreans loved this shape
because they found it everywhere in nature.</p>
<p><strong>shells, sunflowers, plants, ram horns, human fingerprints,
the</strong>: MILKY WAY, and DNA STRANDS.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It really is amazing. In the sea, on land, in
air, our basic building block DNA and even our home.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If we’re built from spirals, while living
within a giant spiral, is it possible that all of human behavior, if it
could be quantified, is in the form of a spiral. Then, maybe, extensions
of our behavior like the stock market. maybe even the writing of The
Torah, is infused with the spiral pattern.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Friday, September fifth. Seven twelve. It’s
fair to say, I’m stepping out onto a limb. But I’m on the edge and
that’s where it happens.</p>
<p><strong>ext. public pay phone - day</strong>: Max eyes Marcy Dawson’s
business card, suspiciously He dials the number. A man answers on the
other line.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Three, eight, two.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Marcy Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Who’s calling?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max Cohen.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Mr. Cohen? I’m so Happy…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look what do you want for the chip?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: You tech guys. I think you know what
we want.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: C’mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work together
We can both profit from this information. We both need each other to get
it, so why not work with us?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know if I’ll find anything useful.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: We’re willing to take the risk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay. First, I want you to call off the
surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Done. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I’m a very private person. Knock on my
door and leave the suitcase outside. I don’t want to talk to Anyone.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: How do I know you’re home?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll knock back.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: The Torah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: In Hebrew characters and numbers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, what is it? The two hundred and sixteen
digits.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: I don’t know. If you get it, maybe we
can figure it out. Can you really find it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If the number’s in there, I’ll find it.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: There you go, dork. Been thinking about my
girlfriend. Haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wha…</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: You want to fuck her, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, no..</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: You calling my girlfriend ugly!? Why don’t
you want to fuck her? You think she’s ugly?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, no, I just. It’s that she’s your girl…</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: So you do want to fuck her. You think
about fucking her in the mouth, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No, no, sir, please. I’ve never touched Devi…I
never will.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Give the fucking genius a Mars bar. Stay
away, or I’ll slice off your balls.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Damn dork.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: He’s just a bit unique.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Unique?! Unique?! He’s a dork!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Friday, September fifth? Lots of work to be
done. But I’m close, so close. Today is the day Might have cost me my
soul, but down the line I’ll work it out. Just keep them in the dark,
let them beg. A damn Ming Mecca chip. It’s like giving a desperate
junkie a syringe filled with junk. Defense uses them to nun nuclear sub
reactors. Me? I’m going to dissect the market.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Happy birthday, Euclid.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Eighteen thirty. Press return… Max darts over
and smacks the RETURN. Moments later we see what Max sees</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh God. Damn religious freaks. The holy
Torah…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ah God…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Too much…too soon.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ohh…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stop, please, stop.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What the?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it!? What is it!?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two…two hundred. That’s it! That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: A phone ringing…once… twice…then we hear</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: He’s alive. His eyes are moving.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Yes, hello?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: He’s busy right now I’m sorry. Max is sprawled
out in front of Euclid. A large amount of blood, from his nose, is
semi-dried on his chin and chest. Devi hangs up the phone.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: You were screaming…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: Who told you you can put extra locks on
the door.</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The number, the number.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: You’re out, you hear me, you’re out.
I’ve had enough of you. Look at all this junk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Four…zero… seven…It’s in my head, it’s in my
head. Somehow I memorized it. I got it up here!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But what is it?</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: What is this stuff? What does it
do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: 0ut, out, you have to get out. Get out, get out
it’s my room!</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ovadia</strong>: That’s it, no way. You’re the one out
of here, mister.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Out! 0utt</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Saturday? Dark outside. There was a moment
there…when, I don’t know…when I didn’t exist. What? What?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Max, is that you? Max? Max, just talk
to me. Things are a bit out of hand down here. People are getting
desperate. We had a deal, Max. A deal. Talk to us, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Must be an explanation, must be a reason.
Must.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two and a quarter, twelve and an eighth, six
and two eighths.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know these…Seven and a quarter. Two and a
half …oh…oh…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My God. It’s gonna crash, it’s gonna fucking
crash.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You’re early. I was just studying our… What did
you do to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I thought you were going to take a break.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You found the two sixteen number in Pi, didn’t
you? You saw it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I saw it, Sol. I don’t know what happened, but
I know things. The market is going to crash. It’s going to crash. It
hasn’t yet, but I know it will. I saw it, Sol. What is it, Sol? What’s
the number?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: You have it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s in my head!</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Okay, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: I gave up before I pinpointed it. But my guess
is that certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular
loop. The loop leads to meltdown, but right before they crash they… they
become “aware” of their own structure. The computer has a sense of its
own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The computer becomes conscious?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: In some ways…I guess…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Studying the pattern made Euclid conscious of
itself. Before it died it spit out the number That consciousness is the
number.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: No, Max, it’s only a nasty bug.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: A door in front of a cliff. You’re driving
yourself over the edge. You need to stop.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stop? How can I stop? I’m this close.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: The bug doesn’t only destroy computers.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Look what it did to your computer. Look what
it’s doing to you.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: It’s killing you. Leave it unknown.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You were afraid of it. That’s why you quit.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Max, I got burnt.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: C’mon, Sol.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: It caused my stroke.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s bullshit. It’s math, numbers, ideas.
Mathematicians are suppose to be out on the edge. You taught me
that!</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Max, there’s more than math! There’s a whole
world…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s where discoveries happen. We have to go
out there alone, all alone, no one can accompany us. We have to search
the edge. We have to risk it all. But you ran from it. You’re a
coward.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Max, it’s death!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can’t tell me what it is. You don’t know
You’ve retreated to your goldfish, to your books, to your Go, but you’re
not satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Get out! Max, get out!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I want to understand it. I want to know!</p>
<p><strong>sol</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>int. subway - port authority - night</strong>: Max paces on a
downtown train as it pulls into 42nd Street.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who are you working for?</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Here, here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t want your wallet. Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who the hell sent you!?</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Wha…I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: I’m…a…student I’ve got an assignment
for class.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Leave me alone, damn it. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. max’s apartment - night</strong>: Max heads home in a
furious state. Suddenly, he sees two of Marcy’s men blocking his path.
It’s Brad and Jake, yet another tough guy, and they don’t look happy.
Max spins around and sees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Marcy? What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Let’s take a ride, Max.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I can’t, I got work…</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: We had a deal! NOW get in the
limo!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t ever hit…</p>
<p><strong>ext. city streets - night</strong>: Max flees. Jake and Brad
charge after him. They’re right on him - he has a meter or so on them.
He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge.</p>
<p><strong>ext. underneath car - night</strong>: Max dives under a car
and crawls for terror. He sees two sets of feet nun by. Max starts to
relax when he notices a pair of heels on the other side of the car.
Marcy bends down and looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Enough, Max, c’mon out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Leave me alone. I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hey! Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: You’re responsible for this.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I didn’t do anything. I didn’t play the
market.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: But we did.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: You have to be careful where you throw
out your trash.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How could you do that?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: You gave us faulty information. You
gave us the carrot, the right picks, but then you only gave us part of
the code.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You selfish, irresponsible cretins. How could
you be so stupid!?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: C’mon, Max. This isn’t a game anymore.
We’re playing on a global scale. We used your code. Foolish…I admit. But
we can fix things if we make some careful picks. Give us the rest of the
code so we can set things right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: C’mon! I know who you are. You’re not gonna
save the world.</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Look, Max…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My God, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: Information is the private language of
Capital. We tried to establish a symbiotic relationship but if you
choose to compete and enter our niche we are forced to comply with the
laws of nature.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>marcy dawson</strong>: C’mon, Max. You don’t get it. I don’t
give a shit about you. I only care about what’s in your fucking head. If
you won’t help us help yourself, then I’ll have only one choice. Destroy
the competition. I’ll take you out of the game. Survival of the fittest,
Max. And we’ve got the gun.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You bastards! You stupid bastards!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Farrouhk!</p>
<p><strong>farrouhk</strong>: He’s sick! He’s sick!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Max!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>int. lenny meyer’s car - moving - night</strong>: Yisrael
yanks the steering wheel to the left, the old station wagon skids around
a corner.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Stay down!</p>

<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: He’s okay, he got in his cab. We’ve

<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Do you have the number?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Do you have the number?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I have it!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You have it. Where is it? You have it
written down?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you doing!? What the hell are you
doing!?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: We’re not joking around, Max? Where’s
the number?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s not on me. It’s in my head.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You memorized it? Did you give it to
them?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Who!? Those Wall Street bastards.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why do you care?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Just answer me!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Screw you!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Hit him!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: You’re dealing with something really
big now, Max. I don’t want to hurt you, so answer me. Did you give it to
them?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They’ve got part of it Now get off me!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Damn it! Damn it! They’re using it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Using what?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: No, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>int. max’s apartment - night</strong>: Max stares
suspiciously at the bathroom. He slowly picks up his drill. Wielding it
like a hammer, he carefully advances into the BATHROOM where he looks
into the sink. He almost vomits when he sees a piece of human brain
sitting above the drain. Ants swarm across its surface.</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Max, Max. You’re okay I’m Rabbi Cohen.
Cohen like you. I’m sorry for what Lenny did, he’s been reprimanded. It
is not our way Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, yeah</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Everything will be fine, Max. You need to
give us the number. Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: I told you we don’t know</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You wouldn’t be so flipped out if you didn’t
know. What’s happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: Give us the number!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Screw you!</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Okay, okay! Lenny, easy! Max, I’ll tell
you what’s going on. Just calm down. The Talmud tells us it began two
thousand years ago, when the Romans destroyed the second temple.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What are you…</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Just give me a chance. You’ll understand
everything if you listen.</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: The Romans also murdered all of our
priest- hood�the Cohanim�the Cohens, and with their deaths they
destroyed our greatest secret. In the center of the great temple was the
holy of holies which was the heart of Jewish life. This was the earthly
residence for our God. The one God. It contained the ark of the
Tabernacle which stored the original Ten Commandments that God gave to
Moses. Only one man could enter this space once a year on the holiest
day of the year, Yom Kippur On the Day of Atonement, all of Israel would
descend upon Jerusalem to witness the High Cohen’s trip into the holy of
holies. If the holy man was pure he would reemerge a few moments later
and Israel was secured a prosperous year. It meant that we were one yea
r closer to the messianic age. Closer to the return of the Garden of
Eden. But if he was impure, he would die instantly and it meant that we
were doomed. The High Cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy
of holies. He had to intone a single word.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: That word was the true name of God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: The true name, which only the Cohanim
knew, was two hundred and sixteen letters long.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re telling me that the number in my head is
the name of God!?</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Yes…it’s The key into the messianic age.
As the Romans burned the temple, the Talmud says, the High Cohen walked
into the flames. He took his secret to the top of the burning building.
The heavens opened up and took the key from the priest’s outstretched
hand. We’ve been searching for the key ever since. And you may have
found it. Now let us find out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s what happened. I saw God.</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: No, no, Max. You’re not pure. You can’t
see God unless you’re pure.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s more than God… it s everything. It’s math
and science and nature… the universe. I saw the Universe’s DNA</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: You saw nothing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I saw everything.</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: There’s much more. We can unlock the door
with the key. It will show God that we are pure again. He will return us
to The Garden.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Garden? You’re not pure. I’m the one who has
the number</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: Who do you think you are? You are a
vessel from our God. You are carrying a delivery that needs to be made
to us.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was given to me. It’s part of me. It’s
changing me.</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: It’s killing you. Because you are
impure.</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: It will kill you!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And what will it do to you?</p>
<p><strong>lenny meyer</strong>: We’re pure. Give us the number!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The number is nothing. You know that!</p>
<p><strong>rav cohen</strong>: We can use it. We can wield it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s just a number. I’m sure you’ve written
down every two hundred sixteen number. You’ve translated all of them.
You’ve intoned them all. Haven’t you? But what’s it gotten you? It’s not
the number! It’s the meaning. It’s the syntax. It’s what’s between the
numbers. If you could understand you would. But it’s not for you! I’ve
got it. I understand it. I’m going to see it! Rabbi…I was chosen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Suddenly, it’s all there. It all makes sense. I
can crack it. I can know it. I know what it is. Sol knows, too. I need
to tell him. I need to show him. I need to bring him with me.</p>
<p><strong>jenny robeson</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sol?</p>
<p><strong>jenny robeson</strong>: Were you a friend?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jenny robeson</strong>: He had a second stroke.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stop it, please!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No. No. I’m ready. I’m ready! Show me!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Three, seven, two…</p>
<p><strong>blinding white void</strong>: where Max looks around
starry-eyed. The pain is gone. Everything is new to Max - even his
hands. The stress leases from his brow and his shoulders sag.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Max. Max! Are you okay!? Oh my God, Max!</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Max! Breathe, Max. Breathe!</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Yes, Max. Listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>…the main room</strong>: where Devi leans over Max. Max’s
eyes are open while he continues to recite the number.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Breathe, Max! Breathe. Focus.</p>
<p><strong>blinding white void</strong>: where Max continues to recite
the number.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: No, Max. No. Stay with me Max. Stay with
me.</p>
<p><strong>the main room</strong>: where Devi grabs Max’s palm. Max’s
fingers wrap around her hand. We return to</p>
<p><strong>the blinding white void</strong>: where Max stops reciting
the number. He suddenly opens his fear filled eyes.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where am I? What is this? This is wrong, Sol.
Sol!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sol! You were right Sol! He was right.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: That’s right Max. That’s Right. Breathe.
Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He was right. I want to breathe. Breathe.</p>
<p><strong>devi</strong>: Yes, breathe, Max. Breathe…</p>
<p><strong>tight on</strong>: a tree branch gently blowing in the
wind.</p>
<p><strong>jehna</strong>: Max, Max!</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Can we do one, Max, can we?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: How about two hundred and fifty-five times a
hundred and eighty-three.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: I got it! I got it! What’s the answer?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know. I really don’t know. What is it,
Jenna?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Forty-six thousand six hundred and
sixty-five.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh.</p>
