<p><strong>voice</strong>: How are you, Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I’d have to say my spine was broken,
Keyser.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Twelve thirty.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded
with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens. The driver didn’t
see anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard a voice. Sometimes, that’s
all you need.</p>
<p><strong>yellow 06/11/94</strong>: 4.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. McManus?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Police. We have a warrant for your
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. auto body shop - day 4</strong>: An old paint mixer
vibrates furiously. TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is
working on an old Fire-bird. A YOUNG HISPANIC KID mixes paint a few feet
away. SUDDENLY, the garage door opens TO REVEAL:</p>
<p><strong>4a .</strong>: A row of five men silhouetted by the bright
sun. Hockney squints.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Todd Hockney’</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Police.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: We don’t do gun repair.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Let me look at you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Now remember, this is another kind of
business. They don’t earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don’t stare
them down but don’t look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to
trust you. That’s the attitude.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I’m having a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: You’ve come far. You’re a good man. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Live with it.</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: Edie, nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Sorry we’re late.</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: Nonsense. Sit, please.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: You must be Mr. Keaton.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’m sorry. Dean Keaton</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Monsieur Renault. A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>low angle: under table</strong>: Edie’s hand reaches out and
finds Keaton’s leg. Her hand runs high up his inner thigh and squeezes
firmly.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. mondino’s restaurant 8’</strong>: Follow a waiter past
the flight of steps.</p>
<p><strong>pan up to reveal:</strong>: SPECIAL AGENT DAVID KUJAN , U.S.
CUSTOMS. Thirtyish, dark-haired and determined.</p>
<p><strong>9 scene deleted</strong>: 9’</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: Edie brought us your proposal and I’ll
be</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: We find the concept brilliant, but New York
is difficult for new restaurants. How can we be certain that our money
will be returned in the long run?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: It’s simple gentlemen, design</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: This was the part of the proposal that
intrigued us, but I’m not sure I follow.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Let’s say for example -</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: This I had to see myself.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Dave. I’m in a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Time for another one.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs. These
gentlemen are with the New York police department. You look great,
Keaton. Better than I would have thought.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: The small matter of a stolen truck-load of
guns that wound up on a boat to Ireland last night.</p>
<p><strong>fortier</strong>: Mr. Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: If you will excuse us for a moment,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: We need to ask you some questions downtown.
You’ll be quite awhile.</p>
<p><strong>renault</strong>: We should leave you to discuss whatever
this is.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Please. Sit.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Enjoy the meal. I’LL call you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: It didn’t make sense that I be there. I mean
these guys were hard-core hijackers, but there I was. At that point, I
wasn’t scared, f knew I hadn’t done anything they could do me for.
Besides, it was fun. I got to make like I was notorious.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all know the
drill. When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase
you’ve been given. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Number one. Step forward.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock-
sucker.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Number two. Step forward.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup.
Everything is the cops’ fault. You don’t put guys like that in a room
together. Who knows what can happen?</p>
<p><strong>13 int. interrogation room - night</strong>: 13</p>
<p><strong>mcmanus</strong>: This has to be embarrassing for you</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you done?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Are you done?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They drilled us all night. Somebody was
pissed about that truck getting knocked off and the cops had nothing.
They were hoping somebody would slip. Give them something to go on. They
knew we wouldn’t fight it because they knew how to lean on us. They’d
been doing it forever. Our rights went right out the window. It was a
violation. I mean disgraceful.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They went after McManus first. He was a good
guy. Crazy though. A top notch entry man .</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: So where’d you dump the truck?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The truck with the guns, fucko.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Right here. Suck it out.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You want to know what your buddy Fenster told
us?</p>
<p><strong>14 int. interrogation room 14</strong>: Now Fenster is in the
seat. He sweats profusely.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: I want to call my lawyer. I don;’t know
about any truck. I was in Connecticut all night on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s not what McManus said.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: McManus. Be told us another story
altogether.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Be fold us about the truck.</p>
<p><strong>voice +</strong>: Who took the guns off your hands?</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Hey, are we talking about the same
thing?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m losing my patience.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Fenster always worked with McManus. He was a
real tight-ass, but when it came to the job, he was right on. Smart guy.
A gopher. Got whatever you needed for next to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: You guys got nothing on me. Where’s your
probable cause?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You’re a known hijacker. You’re sweating like
a guilty motherfucker. That’s my p.c. Save us the time. Tell us where
the truck is.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: HELLO? Can you hear me in the back?
P.C.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Where is it? I’m lookin’. It’s not
happening. What’s going on with that? I want</p>
<p><strong>15 int. interrogation room</strong>: 15</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: - my lawyer. I’ll have your badge,
cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I know you. You don’t think I know you’re
on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don’t have a
fucking leg to stand on.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with
explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You think so, tough guy? I can put you in
Queens the day of the hijacking.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I live in Queens. What the fuck is this?
You come into my store and lock me up in front of my customers. What the
hell is wrong with this country? Are you guys gonna charge me or
what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You know what happens if you do another turn
in the joint?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I’ll fuck your father in the shower. Charge
me, dick-head.</p>
<p><strong>16 int. interrogation room 16</strong>: Now Keaton sits in
the chair, cool and indifferent.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Keaton was the real prize for them, for
obvious reasons.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ll charge you when I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: with what?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You know damn well, dead-man.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did
you ever think to ask me? I’ve been</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s that? The restaurant business? Not
anymore From now on you’re in the getting-fucked-by-us business . I’m
gonna make you famous, cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Like I said. It was all your mistake. Charge
me with it and I’ll beat it. Let’s get back to the truck.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. cell block 18</strong>: Keaton is brought in to a
holding where he joins Fenster, Hockney, Verbal and McManus. He sits in
a corner and keeps to himself.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Somebody should do something. What is this
shit - getting hauled in every five minutes? Okay, so I did a little
time, does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds its way off
the planet?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: These guys got no probable cause.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: You’re fuckin’ A right, no P.C. Well screw
P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you
go. Treat me like a criminal, I’ll end up a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: You are a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Why you gotta go and do that? I’m trying to
make a point.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Then make it. Christ, you’re making me tired
all over.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You heard right.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: The word I got is you hung up your spurs,
man. What’s that all about?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Rumor has it, Keaton’s gone straight -
cleaning house. I hear he’s tapping Edie Finneran.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: She’s a heavy-weight criminal lawyer from
uptown. Big-time connected. She could erase Dillinger’s record if she
tried. I hear she’s Keaton’s meal ticket. Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: I’d say you’ve gotten on his main and
central nerve, McManus.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him
quiet .</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Forget him. It’s not important. I was
trying to make a point.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: This whole thing was a shakedown.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: How many times have you been in a line- up?
It’s always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks
a head half the time. No way they’d line five felons in the same row. No
way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get
you off of that.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity
searched tonight?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets
snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up
with us. They’re grabbing at straws. It’s politics - nothing you can
do.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: I had a guy’s fingers in my asshole
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Is it Friday already?</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Fuck you. I’11 never shit right again. So
who did it? Own up.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
who’s the gimp?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: He’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: How do I know that? How about it,
pretzel-man? What’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys
knew him.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Roger really. People say I talk too
much.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We’ve met once or twice. Last time was
in…</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: County. I was in for fraud.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You were waiting for a line-up then, too.
What happened with that?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I walked. Ninety days, suspended.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: So you did it?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: To your mother’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Why don’t you just calm down’</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: What do you care what he says?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’m interested, sure.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I’m not kidding. Shut your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: No, you’re missing the point. Shut up. I
don’t want to hear anything you have to say. I don’t want to know about
your "job". Just don’t let me hear you. I want nothing to do with any of
you - I beg your pardon but all of you can go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: And that was how it began. The five of us
brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by half-wits. What the
cops never figured out, and what I know now, was that these men would
never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody. ..
Anybody.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. pier - day - san pedro - present day 19</strong>: It
is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene. Harsh sunlight shines
on a line of body bags on the dock.</p>
<p><strong>yellow 06/11/94</strong>: 21.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Fifteen so far. We’re still pulling some bodies
out of the water.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Looking for anyone in particular?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: f don’t want any of the bodies taken away
until I’ve had a chance to go over this, understood?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I have to clear the scene. I’ve got word direct
from the Chief</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
survivors?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Two. There’s a guy in county hospital, but he’s
in a coma. The D.A. has the other guy - A cripple - from New York I
think. Listen, the Chief said -</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>20 mt. ocean</strong>: 20</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: My client offers his full cooperation in
these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all
matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: The district attorney’s office will comply
provided -</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: No provisions, nothing. My clients
testimony for his immunity.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your
political power as much as I respect it. I don’t know why Mr. Kint has
so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don’t care. The
embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen
here.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Immunity.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Counselor, I will prosecute your
client.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Then prosecute. I will be very impressed
to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven
simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I
would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged "faceless
people in City Hall" you mention.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2 1</strong>: One would think the counsel is veiling a
threat.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1 +</strong>: Counsel isn’t veiling anything.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: I’11 take my chances then. I’11 feel safer
without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons
possession.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Weapons. Misdemeanor one.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Counselor, you’re insulting me.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: Counselor, you’re bluffing. Shall I push
for misdemeanor two?</p>
<p><strong>voice #2 +</strong>: Misdemeanor one. Fine. This is
ludicrous.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: As for the rest of the charges grand
larceny, arson… murder - the district attorney will accept the subject’s
testimony in connection with the above mentioned events and in exchange
will offer complete immunity. The transcript… The transcript of said
testimony will be sealed and all matters incriminating to Mr. Kint will
be rendered inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. police station - hallway - day</strong>: 22</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What do you mean I can’t see him?</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: The D.A. came down here last night ready to
arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint’s lawyer comes in and
five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he’d been
bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Did they charge him with anything?</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Weapons. Misdemeanor two.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What’the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: I give the D.A. credit for getting that much
to stick. This whole thing has turned political. The Mayor was here -
the chief - the Governor called this morning, for Christ’s sake. This
guy is</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: When does he post bail?</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Two hours, tops.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I want to see him.</p>
<p><strong>pink 06/07/94</strong>: 23-24.</p>
<p><strong>rabin +</strong>: Dave, please.</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: Even if I was to let you talk to him, he
won’t talk to you. He’s paranoid about being recorded and he knows the
interrogation rooms are wired</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: This won’t be an’ interrogation, just a…
friendly chat to kill time.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: He won’t go into the interrogation room.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Someplace else, then.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: No, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: If it was a dope deal, where’s the dope, if
it was a hit, who called it in?</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: And I am sure you have a host of wild +
theories to answer these questions.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You know damn well what I think.</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: That’s crazy, Dave and it doesn’t matter. He
has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn’t know what you
want to know.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I don’t think he does. Not exactly, but
there’s a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men
died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth
of dope that wasn’t there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton
is dead.</p>
<p><strong>rab zn</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Two hours. Just until he makes bail.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: They’re all dead. No matter how tough you r.
say this Keaton was, no one on that boat could’ve made it out alive.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. hospital - day 24</strong>: A door marked INTENSIVE
CARE. The door BURSTS OPEN. SUDDENLY, the hallway is a flurry of
activity. DOCTOR LISA PLUMBER, age fifty, walks quickly beside JACK</p>
<p><strong>baer .</strong>: Baer walks with all of the determination of
a battalion of Chinese infantry.</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Ridgly, this is Special Agent Jack Baer
from the F.B.I. Agent Baer, this is Doctor Ridgly Waiters.</p>
<p><strong>ridgly</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Is he talking?</p>
<p><strong>ridgly</strong>: He regained consciousness less than an hour
ago. He spoke - not English - then he lapsed.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Hungarian?</p>
<p><strong>ridgly</strong>: I don’t</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: It was Hungarian. Most of them were
Hungarians. Any fluent Hungarians on your staff?</p>
<p><strong>ridgly</strong>: We have a Turkish audiologist.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. hospital room 25</strong>: + Baer comes to an abrupt
halt at the foot of a bed surrounded by a massive tangle of medical
equipment. In the center of it all is the as yet unnamed ARKOSH KOVASH,
mid-thirties. His body is nearly mummified in bandages and plaster from
waist to chin.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: will he die?</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: There’s a chance.</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;Find someone who understands me, you
idiot, I’m going to be killed, You’ll all be killed if he has to do it.
Help me, God. They’re all stupid. Get someone who understands me or
we’re all going to die.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>30a.</strong>: Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket
and dials.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Call hospital security and put a man on the
door until the police get here.</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;Why are you just standing there, you
idiot? I’m not speaking English am I? Wouldn’t it make sense to find
someone who could talk to me so you could find the person that set me on
fire, perhaps? He is the Devil. You’ve never seen anyone like Keyser
Soze in all your miserable life you idiot. Keyser Soze. Do you at least
understand that? Keyser Soze. The Devil himself. Or are you American
policemen io stupid that you haven’t even heard of him. Keyser Soze, you
ridiculous man. KEYSER SOZE . &gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Is he dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Joel, it’s Baer. I’m down at L.A. county. The
guy they pulled out of the harbor is ARKOSH Kovash… Yes, I’m sure… No,
he’s all fucked up… What? I can’t hear you. Shut up, Hugo, I’m on the
phone. Yes… No… Not until I put someone on him. Listen, I need you to
send me someone who can speak Hungarian. He’s awake and talking like a
Thai hooker… How should I know? Get me someone who can talk to him -</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: Keyser - Soze.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: Keyser - Soze.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: No shit? Joel, call Dan Metzheiser over at
Justice and find Dave Kujan from Customs.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. rabin’s office 27</strong>: Kujan and Rabin sit down
across from Verbal.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Verbal, you know we’re trying to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to
help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a
Fed myself but my C.P. was -</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Verbal, I know you know something. I know
you’re not telling us everything.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I told the D.A. everything I know.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I know you liked Keaton I know you think he
was a good man.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I know he was good.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good
thief Anyway, the cops wouldn’t let him go legit.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Keaton was a piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent
Kujan?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I just want to hear your story.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: It’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: According to your statement you are a
short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you
learned from somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: That’s been suppressed. Anything in there is
inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total
immunity .</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Well I do have the weapons charge. I’m
looking at six whole months hard time.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer,
Verbal?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You know a religious guy named John
Paul?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You know Ruby is in Attica?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He didn’t have my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I know Ruby. He’s very big on respect. Likes
me very much.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Now I know your testimony was sealed. Ruby is
well connected. He still has people running errands for him. What do you
think he’d say if he found out you dropped his name to the D.A.?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: There’s nothing in there about Ruby.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I’11 be sure to mention that to him.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: The first thing I learned on the job, know
what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let’s say you arrest three guys for
the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning,
whoever is sleeping is your man. If you’re guilty, you know you’re
caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I’11 get right to the point. I’m smarter than
you. I’11 find out what I want to know and I’11 get it from you whether
you like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’m not a rat.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Ahhh. Back when I was picking beans in
Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee. Right off the trees I mean. That
was good. This is shit, but hey…</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Can we get started again?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Now what happened after the line-up?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: …and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to
tell me he can’t release you? Can you believe that? You weren’t even
charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face
to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Just forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’11 have this thing in front of a grand jury
by Monday.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Edie, please. I don’t want to hear this
right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: They want more time to think about
investing.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: They just said they wanted time.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a
little more, that’s what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now,
they’ll find out who I am.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Give me some credit. I got you this far, let’s
go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: No. It’s never going to stop, period. It
won’t take more than a week before every investor in this city is
walking away from us. It’s finished. I’m finished.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Don’t give up on me now, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: They’ll never stop.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: They ruined me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Let’s just go to my place. We’ll worry about
this tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Come home with me, please. Dean?</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Come home, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What are you doing here’! How did you find
me?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I just asked one of the detectives downtown.
He seemed pretty happy to tell</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Dean, who was at the</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie,
this is Roger Kint, he was at</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I hope I didn’t disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you
something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: A glass of water would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What the hell do you want?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I wanted to talk to you. The other guys
-</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I did you a favor by standing up for you
last night, but don’t think we’re friends. I’m sorry, but I have other
things -</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They’re gonna do a job. Three million
dollars, maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They sent me to offer you a cut. We could
use a fifth man - a driver - That’s all you’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Umm …</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more
creative?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: That’s enough, Edie.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I don’t know what you came here for, but we
won’t have any part of it.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Edie, please.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: I’ve spent the last year of my life putting
his back together again - I won’t have you come in here and - What makes
you think - GET OUT. GET OUT OF m HOME.</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Don’t touch me. Just don’t,</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: If you’ll just let me -</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They’re going to hit the Taxi Service.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: New York’s Finest Taxi Service.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: They - That’s bullshit. They don’t operate
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth
Precinct. They’re coming out for one job - Thursday. They’re picking up
a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have
a fence set to take the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What fence? Who?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Some guy in California. His name is
Redfoot.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You have to come.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What’s with you? What do you care whether I
come or not?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They - They don’t know me. You do. They
won’t take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Don’t tell me you don’t need this. Is this
your place?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They’re never going to stop with us, you
know that. This way we hit the cops where it hurts and get well in the
mean time.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: As clean as you could ever get, they’ll
never let you go now.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You watch your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Okay, okay. You say it’s the real thing?
That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I was out of line.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’11 be alright.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Well, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Forget it. I’11 probably shit blood
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: How are they going to do it?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no
way.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Fenster and Hockney?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They’re pretty pissed off. They’ll do
anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: they won’t
let me in without you.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Three million?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: No killing?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Not if we do it my way.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I swore I’d live above myself.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: New York’s finest Taxi Service was not your
normal taxi service. It was a ring of corrupt cops in the N.Y.P.D. that
ran a high-profit racket, driving smugglers and drug dealers all over
the city. For a few hundred dollars a mile, you got your own black and
white and a police escort. They even had their own business cards.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: After a while, somebody started asking
questions and the taxi service shut down. Ever since then, Internal
Affairs had been waiting to catch them in the act.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: And that was how we started. McManus came to
us with the job; Fenster got the vans; Hockney supplied the hardware; ’I
came through with how to do it so no one got killed - but Keaton -
Keaton put on the finishing touch. A little "Fuck you" from the five of
us to the N.Y.P.D.</p>
<p><strong>rizzi</strong>: How was the flight?</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: Will that get me to the Pierre?</p>
<p><strong>rizzi</strong>: That’ll get you to Cape God.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. highway 35</strong>: The cruiser heads towards the
heart of Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>36 ext. street - later</strong>: 36</p>
<p><strong>37 int. police car</strong>: 37</p>
<p><strong>strausz</strong>: What the</p>
<p><strong>39 int. police car</strong>: 39</p>
<p><strong>strausz</strong>: Give it up.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. front van</strong>: 40</p>
<p><strong>strausz</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: We db now, Jerk-off.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: The papers got Keaton’s call that day and
were on the scene before the cops were. Strausz and Rizzi were indicted
three days later. Within a few weeks, fifty more cops went down with
them. It was beautiful. Everybody got it right in the ass, from the
chief on down.</p>
<p><strong>43 int. garage - night</strong>: 43</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: When does the fence come?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: In California?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Hold the fuckin’ phone. You and Fenster?
No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I’m sure you can understand my
hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Then who goes?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: We all go. How about it, Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We need to lay low for a while.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. waiting room - law office - day 45’</strong>: Keaton
and Verbal sit side by side on a sofa. A sign on the door behind them
reads: MONTGOMERY and LaGUARDIA - ATTORNEYS</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: We’re going to miss the flight.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Don’t do this. Send her a card -
something.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ms. Finneran will be with you in a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: We’re gonna miss the plane. She’ll
understand.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You wanted to know what happened after the
line-up, I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you’re
talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman?
Bullshit. He was using her.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He loved her.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Sure. And I’m supposed to believe that
hitting the Taxi Service wasn’t his idea</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: That was all Fenster and McManus.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who
else would know the Taxi Service</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You keep trying to lay this whole ride on t
Keaton. It wasn’t like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned
around. r I’m telling you straight, I swear. +</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Let me tell you something. I know Dean
Keaton. I’ve been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a
cold- + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force, so don’t sell me the hooker with the
heart of gold. +</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You got him wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total +
of seven times when he was on the force. + In every case, witnesses
either reversed + their testimony to the grand jury or died + before
they could testify. When they t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent
+ five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a
knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can’t
prove this but I can’t prove the best part either.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that? r He
died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of
a witness who was going to testify against him. Two people saw Keaton
enter a warehouse he owned just before it went</p>
<p><strong>50 int. workshop 50</strong>: Rabin and Louis look at one
another as they listen.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He was dead just long enough for a murder rap
to blow over, then he had lunch.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I don’t know about that.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I don’t think you do. But you say you saw
Keaton die. I think you’re covering his ass and he’s still out there
somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet
is he’s using you because you’re stupid and you think he’s your friend.
You tell me he’s dead, so be it. I want to make sure he’s dead before I
go back to New York.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He wasn’t behind anything. It was the
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What lawyer, Verbal?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Back when I was in that barber shop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois I used to have</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You think I don’t know you held out on the
D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to
Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: The D.A. gave me immunity.</p>
<p><strong>not from me, you piece of shit. there is</strong>: NO
IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the
hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put
in prison,</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Is he the one that killed Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: No. But I’m sure Keaton’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Convince me. Tell me every last detail.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. hospital - day 53</strong>: + Kovash’s room is now
filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a
balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from
her is Ridgly Waiters.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Are you the translator?</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: Patrolman Lionel Bodi, sir.</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Agent Beer, this is getting out of
hand.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I’11 see to it we’re gone before he blows his
porch light, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: This is Tracy Fitzgerald. She’s a composite
sketch artist from county.</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: I’ve got a noon meeting, Baer.</p>
<p><strong>plumber</strong>: Agent Baer, please.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Everyone calm down. Ask this man about the
shoot-out in the harbor.</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: &lt;&lt;My name is Bodi. How are
you’&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;How am 17 You are as stupid as that
one, but at least I can talk to you.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: &lt;&lt;You’ll be alright. He is from the
F.B.I. He is here to help you. He wants to know what happened in the
harbor.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take
him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says they were buying It doesn’t make
sense. I’m sorry, I’m a little rusty. They were there to buy
something.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Dope, we know.</p>
<p><strong>kovash +</strong>: &lt;&lt;You don’t understand me either?
God help me, they are all idiots. s We were there to buy a man, you
simple boy. A witness. I don’t know his name. A witness who knew the
Devil.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He
doesn’t knob what they were buying. But not dope… people.</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;I’ll tell you everything. I’11 even
say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want
protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: Your witness is whacked, Baer.</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says he’ll tell us everything he knows if
we protect him.</p>
<p><strong>.baer</strong>: Tell him fine.</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: &lt;&lt;He says that is fine.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from
the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and
looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: No good. He needs guarantees. He says… his
life is in danger… He has seen the Devil… looked him in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: I’11 be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Tell him to tell this man what he was telling
me before. Who is the Devil? Who did he see?</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: &lt;&lt;Who is this Devil you keep talking
about?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: Keyser Soze He was in the harbor shooting
everyone in sight.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says he saw him in the harbor. He was
shooting… Killing… Killing many men.</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: Did he say Keyser Soze? He saw Keyser
Soze</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says he saw him in the harbor. He was
shooting… Killing… Killing many men.</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: Did he say Keyser Soze? He saw Keyser
Soze.</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I’ve seen
his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says he knows his face. He sees it when he
closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>metzheiser</strong>: Ask him what this Devil looks like.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. los angeles skyline - day - five weeks
prior</strong>: 54</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: McManus’ fence was this guy named Redfoot.
He had a good reputation around L.A. Seemed like a good guy - Looked
like a cowhide full of thumbtacks.</p>
<p><strong>55 ext. friendship bell - night 55’</strong>: All five guys
stand in a group. It is utterly quiet. An old but well kept Cadillac
creeps into the lot from the far end and idles up to them. The windows
are tinted too much to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them
and drives on.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: How’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Alright. How’s it going, Fenster?</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Getting by.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: You got it?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Snazzy dresser this guy.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: You must be Keaton.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: The man with the plan.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Are you guys interested in more work?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We’re on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: I’ve got a ton of work and no good
people.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: A jeweler out of Texas named Saul. He rents
a suite at a hotel downtown and does free appraisals. Buys whatever he
can. Word is he moves with a lot of cash. I’11 take the merchandise, you
keep the green.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Security?</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Two bodyguards. Pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: I’d expect nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Take your time. Enjoy L.A.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: A friend of mine in New York tells me you
knew Spook Hollis.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah,
he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin’ shame he
got shivved.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I shivved him.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Better you hear it from me now than somebody
else later.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Business or personal?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: A little of both.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Ain’t it a crime? Call if you’re
interested.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: One job, that was the deal.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: This is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: What is it Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Something - I don’t know. I ever tell you
about the restaurant I wanted to open?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: L.A., was good for about two hours. We were
from New York. There’s no place to eat after one; you can’t get a pizza
that doesn’t taste like a fried fruit-bat, and the broads don’t want to
know you if you don’t look like a broad. Within a few days the last of
us was ready to go back to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn’t have it, so he
really didn’t have a choice. We went to work.</p>
<p><strong>ding-ding</strong>: The elevator bell sounds at the far end
of the garage. The doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and
look around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white haired
menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned. They are bodyguards
and give it away by their every careful move.</p>
<p><strong>higham</strong>: Just get in the car Saul.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I get out of the car, and man if the thing
wasn’t wrecked. And I see this broad in the back seat with nothing
on.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I’m laughing so hard I can’t breathe -</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: …And the fat guy comes out of the car with
his pants on backwards and says -</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Give me the case.</p>
<p><strong>boom</strong>: Both of McManus’ guns go off like one shot.
Tucci and Higham collapse, each with a bullet in his head</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Move.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We did it your way. Now I’11 deal with
him.</p>
<p><strong>mcmanus</strong>: You gonna kill him?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I’m going to deal with him.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Get a grip. I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: The job got thrown to me by this
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Some Limey. He’s a middle-man for somebody.
He doesn’t say and I don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We want to meet him.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: He wants to meet you. He called last night
and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him’</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Tell him we’ll meet.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: McManus, you’re a real bad-ass, but get off
my tip.</p>
<p><strong>redfoot</strong>: Real shame about Saul getting whacked.
Lot’s of cops looking for the guys that did it. I’m sure They’ll get
around to asking me.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: So this lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Kobayashi.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Came from Redfoot.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: And why leave this out when you talked to the
D.A.?</p>
<p><strong>a knock at the door</strong>: Rabin sticks his head in.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Someone to see you, Agent Kujan.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Jack. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I’ve been looking all over for you. You still
after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: You can stop looking. There was no coke. I’ve
been in L.A. county with a guy they</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: There was ninety-one million -</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: We know, but our man says no way on the dope.
This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey
the next’ day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no
means to move it.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What was the money for?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: He didn’t know. No one doing the deal knew
except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it.
Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: They tell me you got the cripple from New York
in there. He mention Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Who ?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Bear with me here…</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Who is Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Ahhh fuck.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. hollywood athletic club - day - two weeks prior
64’</strong>: Keaton stands while the rest sit and listen.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: So I need to know if anyone can think of
anybody. Somebody with power. Enough to possibly track us from New
York.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Mr. Keaton?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I am Mr. Kobayashi. I’ve been asked by my
employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen. That must be Mr. Hockney.
I recognize Mr. Fenster from his mug shot, as well as Mr. McManus. I can
only assume that you are Mr. Kint. I believe you were the one who
disposed of Saul. My employer sends his gratitude. A most unexpected
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What can we do for you?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: My employer requires your services. One
job. One day’s work. Very dangerous. I don’t expect all of you to live,
but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way
they see fit.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Who’s your boss?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: My employer wishes to remain
anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Don’t jerk me off. We all know what this is.
You don’t work with me if I work with you without knowing who I’m
working for. Now let’s cut the shit. Who’s the man?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I work for Keyser Sate.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Who’s Keyser Soze?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I am sure you’ve heard a number of tall
tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze I can assure you gentlemen, most
of them are true.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Who’s Keyser Soze?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Judging by the sudden change in mood, I
am sure the rest of your associates can tell you, Mr. Kint. I have come
with an offer directly from Mr. Soze. An order actually.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: An order.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York. The cargo
was raw steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze and was destined for
Pakistan to be used in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable violation of
U.N. Regulations. You had no way of knowing this, because the man
shipping the steel was working for Mr. Sate without his knowledge. +
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a twin-prop cargo flight earlier
this year out of Newark airport. The plane was carrying platinum and
gold wiring. Also set for Pakistan.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck
carrying gun parts through Queens -</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: - guns allegedly set to be destroyed by
the state of New York. They were to be "lost" in a weigh station and
routed to Belfast. Again, Mr. Sate using pawns who had no knowledge.
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze less
than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence seam by
a cripple. He was relieved of sixty-two thousand dollars. Now - It has
taken us some time to find you. Our intention was to approach you after
your apprehension in New York.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You set up the line-up.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were
not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton’s
attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his
release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What about Redfoot?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely
t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who
they’re working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: So why tell us?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze.
That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are
still alive, but he feels you owe him. You will repay your debt.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Who is this guy? How do we know you work
for Soze</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I don’t think that is relevant,
Mr. Hockney. The five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg
and his bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to your involvement, and we
can see to it that he will. He is not of your "superior" breed.</p>
<p><strong>mcmanus</strong>: This is a load of shit.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze’s
primary interest, as I am sure you all know, is narcotics. He’s been -
competing shall we say, with a group of</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t kill
you right now.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Jesus Christ. Open them.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: They know everything.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Everybody I ever worked with, did time
with.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: They fucking know everything.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: This is not right.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: I don’t know. Who was that guy that used to
talk about Soze in New York?</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect
stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This
Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: I don’t know. This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: It’s bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I
think it’s a setup.</p>
<p><strong>fenster</strong>: The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of
butcher. No pity.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: There’ is no Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Who is Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>65 int. rabin’s office - day - present 65</strong>: Kujan
leans into Verbal’s face. He hangs on his every word.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He is supposed to be Turkish. Some say r his
father was German. Nobody believed he was real. Nobody ever saw him or
knew anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi
tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze. You never knew. That was
his power. The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the
world he didn’t exist. One story the guys told me - the story I believe
- was from his days in Turkey. There was a petty gang of Hungarians that
wanted their own mob. They realized that to be in power you didn’t need
guns or money or even numbers. You just needed + the will to do what the
other guy wouldn’t. After a while they come to power, and then they come
after Soze He was small time then, just running dope, they say…</p>
<p><strong>67 int. soze’s home - day 67</strong>: Three of the
Hungarians come bursting into Keyser Soze’s + home. They grab his five
children and round them up in the front room. One of the men grabs his
wife and back-hands her across the face.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They come to his home in the afternoon
looking for his business. They find his wife and kids in the house and
decide to wait for Sate.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He comes home to his wife raped and his
children screaming. The Hungarians knew Soze was tough. Not to be
trifled with. So they let him know they meant business.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: They tell Soze they want his territory - all
his business. Soze looks over the + faces of his family… Then he showed
these men of will what will really was.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He tells him he would rather’ see his family
dead than live another day after this.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He lets the last Hungarian go, and he goes
running. He waits until his wife and kids are in the ground and he goes
after the rest of the mob. He kills their kids, he kills their wives, he
kills their parents and their parents’ friends.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He burns down the houses they live in and
the stores they work in, he kills people that owe them money. And like
that he was gone. Underground. No one has ever seen him again. He
becomes a myth, a spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.
If you rat on your pop, Keyser Sate will get you. And nobody really ever
believes.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Do you believe in him, Verbal?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Keaton always said: "I don’t believe in God,
but I’m afraid of him." Well I believe in God, and the only thing that
scares me is Keyser SOZE.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: You give this any weight, Agent Baer?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from
Justice. He has a file on Sate in D.C. It’s been a hobby of his for a
few years. A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the Incredible
Hulk.</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: Had you heard of him before?</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: On the street? A few times. Outside stuff.
Somebody was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money
through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit. Could be an old badge. A hex
sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant
something.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: But you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Shit yeah. I got a guy trying to walk out of
the hospital on d fried drumstick to get away from SOZE. I’11 run it up
the flagpole.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I came clean. I told it like it happened on
the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It’s got so many holes
in it, the D.A. would’ve told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got
what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: And this is why you never told the D.A.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the
Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Turn state’s evidence. Take the stand on this
and we’ll hear it out.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’ve got immunity now. What can you possibly
offer me?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: If there is a Keyser Soze he’ll be looking
for you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Where’s your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you
think the pressure’s coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to
call him - knows where I am right now. He’s got the front burner under’
your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity
was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I
post bail.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: So why play into his hands? We can protect
you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion. You’ll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.
The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are
telling me They’ll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser
Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and
sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid
of me. After that, my guess is you’ll never hear from him again.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. hallway outside hospital room - day 72</strong>:
Doctor Plumber watches from out in the hall. + Kovash spits out a
constant river of Hungarian while Bodi tries to keep up, relaying
everything to Tracy Fitzgerald.</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;It was smaller than that.
Sharper.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: +</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so
dark. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: &lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>kovash</strong>: &lt;&lt;Don’t be stupid.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>bodi</strong>: He says the hair is longer and lighter.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: That was how I ended up in a barber shop
quartet in Skokie, Illinois.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: This is totally irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Oh, but it’s not. If I hadn’t been nailed in
Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would
have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That
barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Can we just get back to Kobayashi?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: The quartet is part of the bit about
Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I
had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me
better than I did. They knew all of us.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You’re stalling, Verbal.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Give a guy a break, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: We woke up the next morning and Fenster was
gone. He couldn’t handle the idea of slumming for SOZE. He left a note
wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we’d scraped
together.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: McManus was furious. He was talking about
tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That
night we got the call.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: What call?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Kobayashi told us where we could find
Fenster.</p>
<p><strong>76 ext. beach - night - two weeks prior 76</strong>: Keaton
looks out over the ocean and smokes a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What do you want to do with him?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I’m sorry, McManus.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: No time.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: No shovel.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: This is nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: This is fucking dry sand, man. When he
rots, the surfers’ll smell him from a hundred yards out.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Keaton, we gotta go. They’re gonna find
him.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Dig.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: What are we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: I can run. I got no problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: They don’t seem to have a problem with it
either.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: This ain’t my boy we’re burying. I don’t
owe anybody.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Since when?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: IT’S NOT PAYBACK. I don’t answer to you. +
It’s precaution. You want payback? You want to run? I don’t care. I’m
going to finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not for anybody else, but
for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn’t going to stand over me. All of
you can go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: And after they killed Fenster nobody would
run?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I wanted to. I thought we could make it.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Why didn’t you say anything?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn’t
have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An
ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It’s always
simple. There’s</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: He’s coming up.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: The answer is no.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Mr. Soze will be most -</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser
Sate. If you say his name again, I’11 kill you right here.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: A strange threat. I can only assume
you’re here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We know you can get to us, and now you know
we can get to you. I’m offering you the chance to call this off.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind.
He does not change it.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Neither do we.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I believe you, Mr. McManus. I quite
sincerely do. You would not have been chosen if you were not so capable,
but I cannot make this decision. Whatever you can threaten me with is…
ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I am sorry, Mr. McManus. f implore you to
believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very + determined.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Before you do me in, you will let me
finish my business with Ms. Finneran first, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my
office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case
personally. She flew out yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>93 int. lobby 93</strong>: Edie glances toward the men in the
hall. Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others. From where
Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to a group of
harmless maintenance men.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Ms. Finneran’s escort in Los Angeles.
Never leaves her for a moment. I thought you’d like to know she was in
good hands.</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will
be ready for you on Friday. If I see you or your friends before then, or
fail to check in every half hour with that unpleasant looking man in
there, Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim of a gruesome violation
before she dies. As will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your Uncle
Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I might only castrate Mr. McManus’ nephew,
David. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>kobayashi</strong>: I’11 take care of the dead men
downstairs. We’ll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster. Now if you’ll
excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: It’s a logistical nightmare. Close quarters,
no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Can we stealth these guys?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Doubtful. With all that coke, they’ll be
ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets
through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it
can’t be done. Anyone who walks into this won’t come out alive.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Did you hear what he just said?</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: If I’m going in, I want a stake.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I just can’t believe we’re just gonna walk
into certain death.</p>
<p><strong>pause</strong>: They all suddenly realize the weight of their
situation.</p>
<p><strong>finally:</strong>: McMANUS</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: What-are they speaking?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Russian, I think. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Hungarian?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>continue past him to reveal</strong>: r</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: Are we ready, kids?</p>
<p><strong>100 ext. boathouse.– roof 100</strong>: McManus is
positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse. He stops and grabs his
radio.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Everyone shut up. I’m ready. McManus, you
better be set up in ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I want you to stay here. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>verbal +</strong>: But I’m supposed to -</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: If we don’t make it out, I want you to take
the money and go.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Keaton, I can’t just -</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I want you to find Edie. Both of you find
some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people.
She’ll know what to do. If we can’t get Kobayashi my way, she’ll get him
her way.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: What if I</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Just do what I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Tell her I… Tell her I tried.</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. boathouse - roof 103’</strong>: McMANUS’S P.O.V.
McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene. The
cross-hairs breeze past Keaton and find a target. A man in a suit.</p>
<p><strong>hockney’s p.o.v.</strong>: A few men standing on the dock
near the stern of the large boat, move towards the commotion.</p>
<p><strong>it explodes</strong>: The men surrounding Keaton, are
distracted. Keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two
men closest to him.</p>
<p><strong>hockney</strong>: &lt;&lt;DON’T SHOOT, DON’T SHOOT. LET’S GET
THE + FUCK OUT OF HERE. EVERYONE IS DEAD.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><strong>boom</strong>: BLOOD sprays all over the money. Hockney looks
at it, puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>117 ext. boat deck 117’</strong>: The crane continues to
swing. A single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended
pellet.</p>
<p><strong>119 ext. boat 119</strong>: Keaton finds the hatch and goes
below, shooting a man on his way up the stairs. McManus jumps on board
and runs down behind him.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Why didn’t you run?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I froze up. I thought about Fenster and how
he looked when we buried him, then I thought about Keaton. It looked
like he might pull it off.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: A boy came across a body on the beach this
morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two
guys from the F.B.I. just identified him. +</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: And ?</p>
<p><strong>rabin</strong>: His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler
out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking.
He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were
setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie
Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Kobayashi.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: I called New York County and they fared me a
copy of Marquez’s testimony. He was a rat.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: A big fucking rat.</p>
<p><strong>rabin +</strong>: Arturo was strongly opposed ’to going back
to prison. So much so that he informed on close to fifty guys. Guess who
he names for a finale?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: There’s more.</p>
<p><strong>123 int. rabin’s office - moments later 123</strong>: Kujan
walks in and sits down in front of Verbal. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I’11 tell you what I know. Stop me when it
sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: There was no dope on that boat.</p>
<p><strong>man in robe</strong>: He’s here. I saw him on deck.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: There’s no coke.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: Where’s Hockney?</p>
<p><strong>keaton</strong>: I can’t remember which way.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. hallway - cabin 128</strong>: Jaime squints and
cocks his head.</p>
<p><strong>man in robe</strong>: I told them nothing.</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. deck - moments later 130</strong>: The boat is quiet
now. Keaton walks out onto the deck. He looks out over the pier and sees
Verbal standing in the middle of the carnage, frozen. Their eyes meet.
Keaton waves at him as if to shoe him away.</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. deck 136</strong>: Keaton never sees the crane
coming.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: And that’s when you say in your statement
that you saw…</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I don’t have a minute. Are you saying it was
Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn’t know who it was.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I - there had to be dope there.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Don’t shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You
know what I’m getting at.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I don’t understand what you’re saying. I saw
Keaton get shot, I swear to you.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Then why didn’t you help him?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it
was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn’t bring myself to raise my gun
to him.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: But Keaton…</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the
Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?</p>
<p><strong>yellow 06/11/94</strong>: 109.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: What if you miss?</p>
<p><strong>move further, slower, into the darkness.</strong>: Voices
yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding darkness.</p>
<p><strong>blue 06/01/94</strong>: 110.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Wha- No.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had
seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate
knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug
trafficking and murder.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: His own people were selling him to a gang of
Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
back in Turkey. The money wasn’t there for dope. The Hungarians were
going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I said I never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I don’t</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: There were no drugs on that boat. It was a
hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser
Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march
into certain death.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: But how - wait. You’re saying SOZE sent t us
to kill someone?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I’m saying Keaton did.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If
you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you
off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: He wanted me to live.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty
cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a
worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why’</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Edie.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I don’t buy that reform story for a minute.
And even if I did, I certainly don’t believe he would send you to
protect her. So why?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Because he was my friend.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: No, Verbal. You weren’t friends. Keaton
didn’t have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was
his will.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Keaton was Keyser Soze</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: The kind of guy who could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus. The kind of man who could engineer a
police line-up from all his years of contacts in N.Y.P.D.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: They found her yesterday in a hotel in
Pennsylvania. Shot twice in the head.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Edie…</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He used all of you to get him on that boat.
He couldn’t get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make
sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: This is all bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He left you to stay behind and tell us he was
dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first
police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you
didn’t see him die.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I knew him. He would never -</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: He programmed you to tell us just what he
wanted you to. Customs has been</p>
<p><strong>but why me? why not hockney or fenster or</strong>: McMANUS?
I’m a cripple. I’m stupid. Why me?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Because you’re a cripple, Verbal. Because
you’re stupid. Because you were weaker than them. Because you couldn’t
see far enough into him to know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: If he’s dead, Verbal - if what you say is
true, then it won’t matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in
New York, wasn’t it? Tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: It was all Keaton. We followed him from the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I didn’t know. I saw him die. I believe he’s
dead. Christ</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Why lie about everything else, then?</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You know what it’s like, Agent Kujan, to
know you’ll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked
around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be
good at anything ’cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn’t</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You’re not safe on your own.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: You think he’s..?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Is he Keyser Soze I don’t know, Verbal. It
seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story,
but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you.
Stay here and let us protect you.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’m not bait. No way. I post today.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo
wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state’s.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: I’11 take my chances, thank you. It’s
tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna
run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants
to get you, you know They’ll get you out there.</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Maybe so, but I’m no rat, Agent Kujan. You
tricked me, that’s all. I won’t keep my mouth shut ’cause I’m scared.
I’11 keep it shut ’cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie
Finneran too. And if they kill me, it’s</p>
<p><strong>verbal</strong>: Fuckin’ cops.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: One watch: gold. One cigarette lighter: gold.
One wallet: brown. One pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>blue 06/01/94</strong>: 116.</p>
<p><strong>146 int. rabin’s office 146</strong>: Kujan stares solemnly
at the bulletin board, drinking from Rabin’s coffee cup. Rabin sits at
the desk, sifting through the mound of gapers as though considering
organizing them once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: You still don’t know shit.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I know what I wanted to know about
Keaton.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Which is shit.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: No matter. He’ll have to know how close we
came.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton’s alive he’ll
never come up again.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: I’11 find him.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: A rumor is not a rumor that doesn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Nothing. Something I - forget it.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: Man, you’re a fucking slob.</p>
<p><strong>rab in</strong>: Yeah. It’s got it’s own system though. It
all makes sense when you look at it right. You just have to step back
from</p>
<p><strong>yellow 06/11/94</strong>: 118.</p>
<p><strong>kujan</strong>: WHERE IS HE? DID YOU SEE HIM? t</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The Cripple? He went that way.</p>
<p><strong>driver’s p.o.v.</strong>: The driver’s hands tap the wheel
patiently. His eyes follow Verbal as he fumbles through the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>157 ext. street 157</strong>: LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens
of people. Verbal’s feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They
hobble along the curb.</p>
<p><strong>i-</strong>: of the grace and coordination of a sculptor’s,
flicking the clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the
flint with the index finger. It is a fluid motion, somewhat showy.</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. street 159</strong>: The car stops. The driver gets
out. IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He smiles
to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the smile as he opens
the passenger door and gets in.</p>
