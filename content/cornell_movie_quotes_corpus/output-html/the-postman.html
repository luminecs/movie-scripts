<h1 id="the-postman">the-postman</h1>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: The last of the great cities died when my
father was a child. Another victim of yet another war. The plagues
followed. And the terrors. The living hid themselves away in tiny
hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them
of the little that remained. The Earth itself had fallen prey to chaos.
For three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. The
ocean was barren. Poisoned. Near death.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sixteen long years passed before the great
lungs started working again. My father said it was as if the ocean
breathed a great sigh of relief…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t know. And if you ask me again,
I’m going to slug you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s been fun, hasn’t it, kids? You’re
welcome!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check
it first!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Better than turpentine. Tastes about
the same. Your call, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You ain’t picky, Bill. I like that
about you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Running on Empty’? Tell me about
it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147 channels.
Everything from Jesus to ‘Jeopardy’.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Like sands through the hour- glass, so
are the days of our lives…’ ‘Michael Shields, come on down, you’re the
next contestant on…’The Price is Right’.’ I’ll take Domestic Nuclear
Disasters for two hundred thousand, Alex…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We interrupt our regularly scheduled
program to bring you the Second Civil War… Well, shit.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t want any trouble… I bet you
don’t either… Let’s just call it a draw, okay?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Look out, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m rich.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m just passing through. I don’t mean
anyone any harm. Water’s good.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m not a Holnist.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m headed for a town called St. Rose.
Somewhere west of Portland.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Portland’s under twenty feet of
water.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Well, I heard different.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: You mouthin’ me?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No, it’s just that it’s hard to get
good information.</p>
<p><strong>hulking bandit</strong>: He is mouthin’ you; I say we kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Don’t be in such a rush, Martin. Now I
see a pack mule over there, but I don’t see no packs.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This is all I got.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Oh… Kill him, Martin.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Okay! My stuff’s up there!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: What do you got in there?</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Shut up. What do you got in there?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Dried peas. Beef jerky. Cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>all three bandits</strong>: Cigarettes!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Sure. There’s the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Maybe he’s got it booby-trapped.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: You go up and get it.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Just you start tossing those cigarettes
down!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Maybe he fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s going to take a second. I got my
stuff bolted in.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: Put some buckshot through it, Martin.
Just to hurry him up.</p>
<p><strong>hulking bandit</strong>: I only got three shells left.</p>
<p><strong>lead bandit</strong>: So use his gun.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Bill!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: We’re rich!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s true, we haven’t done this in a
while, but it’s like riding a bicycle. Now, open your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I know the rule. It’s my rule! Avoid
civilization at all costs. But we gotta eat, don’t we? What are you so
worried about, Bill? All you gotta do is stand there. I’m the one with
all the lines.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: They said, ‘Fear not, MacBeth, ’til
Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane’!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I said, Birnam Wood comes to
Dunsinane!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Arm, arm yourselves! If the witch’s
words are true, there’ll be no running or hiding here!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day
after that. Out brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player
that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It’s a tale
told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But blow,
wind! Come wrack! At least we’ll die with the harness off our back!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: The children have never heard
Shakespeare before.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: They still haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thanks. You’re very nice.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon larry</strong>: I’m clapping because you
stink.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t think you understand how it
works.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon larry</strong>: When I was young, I tried to be an
actor. I was awful. But now I won’t die thinking I was the worst
one.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m glad I could help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: Larry, stop it. You were very
good.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Good enough to get something to
eat?</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Holnists! Holnists are coming!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. thompson</strong>: It’s okay. We give them food and
supplies. All the towns do.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: They hardly kill anyone lately. Just take a
woman sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Well, I’d just as soon not give them
anything of mine. Let’s find the back door, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I said, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: It’s just a game, General Bethlehem.
Something they saw in a play. No harm in it.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: A play? Show me. It’s all right,
children, show me.</p>
<p><strong>brave boy</strong>: Arm, arm yourselves! No running from the
witches!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Shakespeare, is it? Well, I’m sorry I
missed it.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You should know, sir, we haven’t nearly
stocked the game we thought we would.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Really? But you had time for a play?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I’m taking three conscripts from each
town. They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such
time as I see fit. Three men. You suppose you could do that?</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable
ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Acceptable, Captain!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’ll need to put some meat on, but I
like an impressionable mind. Acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Mongoloid. Unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I want pure blood. Someone like…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: That man.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: You were required to show yourself.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: But, I’m not with these people. I’m
just passing through. I –</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Take the mule.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Hi?</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Well… I mean, we know each other, kind
of…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: So what did you guys do with my
cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: We traded them for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Wonderful. What happened to your
partners?</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: They traded me to the Holnists.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Ten hut!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You
have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of
Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the
weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been
saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You. What did you do before you were
given this opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>gangly recruit</strong>: I had a shovel. I digged holes.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You digged holes… Well, now you’re going
to fill them. And you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Is there any question in anyone’s mind
that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are
you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m just a performer. Shakespeare.
Stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: He was a writer. He –</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I know who Shakespeare was… ‘Cry “Havoc!”
and let slip the dogs of war.’</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I, um, you want a line?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘To be or not to be: That is the
question.’</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: ‘We few, we happy few, we band of
brothers.’</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this son of York.’</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’re pretty good. You’re also a
fighter. I see it in your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Don’t you agree? Come on, a man’s got to
speak his mind.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t mean any disrespect, sir, but
you’d be better off just letting me go. A fighter is about the last
thing I am.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Don’t you think I should be the judge of
that, soldier?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Get up. I said, get up.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Put up your fists.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’d win.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Now fight.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’re right. You’re not a fighter. But
you will be. I’m giving you a chance at a life that means something. A
life worth living.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Let’s move it. Everybody up and at ’em.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thanks. Did I win?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I tried to tell him…</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: Say it again.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: The words you said in town. About the wind
blowing. And the rest… Say it again.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Blow, wind. Come wrack. At least we’ll
die with the harness off our back.’</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: What’s it mean?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Live free or die.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: All right, girls. We’re gonna run. Twenty
miles. With packs. You got three hours. Everybody makes it. Or nobody
eats.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Eat up! You got meat tonight.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Why don’t you tell Shakespeare what kind of
meat that is.</p>
<p><strong>cook</strong>: Mule.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: A godawful animal. The sterile offspring of a
horse and a donkey. Can you imagine that?! There’s no room in this new
world for a bastard like that.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Uh uh. Any man last in line ain’t hungry
enough. You show up last, you don’t eat!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: I’ll die before I’m last in line
again.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s what they’re hoping for.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Serious? This isn’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: These were supposed to be the best
years of my life.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: The laws of eight, gentlemen. That is the
legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.</p>
<p><strong>recruits</strong>: God rest his soul!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: May he burn in hell.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: These are the laws that we live by. The
eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Only then will you be part of the clan.
Sit down, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law One. You will obey orders without
question. I told you to sit.</p>
<p><strong>slow recruit</strong>: There weren’t enough chairs.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I didn’t specify chairs. You could’ve sat
down on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You disobeyed a direct order. You broke
Law One.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law Two. Punishment shall be swift.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four:
Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six:
Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for
leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: On your feet!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law Eight: There is only one penalty:
Death.</p>
<p><strong>slow recruit</strong>: Please, I’m begging you.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You will get out of this army what you
put into it. Work and you’ll be fed. Fight and you’ll be respected. Die
and you’ll be remembered. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: You thinking of challenging for leadership of
the clan?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No, sir. I’m a follower not a
leader.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: You see Colonel Getty? Always following the
General? He’s the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six
seconds, but the General didn’t kill him. He cut off his tongue and he
cut off his balls and old Getty’s been following him like a dog ever
since.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: The General don’t see it, but I say you got
some nigger in you.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: The General would like a word with you,
Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: binoculars on the</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No offense, General, but you seem to
have read some Shakespeare yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery,
a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history.
Even a sense of the dramatic. Do you know what I did before the war? Do
you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman.
The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked
away inside me.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: If Nathan Holn hadn’t come along, I’d
still be selling copying machines. Can you imagine the wasted life? Can
you imagine the magnitude of it? But war… War gives men like me a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Here… ‘The prize is often left unclaimed.
Have the courage to grasp it. For fortune always favors the bold.’ It
always inspires me. I have a design for the future. A master plan. I’ll
need able officers to carry it out. You have the intelligence. If your
heart matches, you’ll go far. We’ll talk more in the weeks to come.
Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Issue the binoculars to a scout.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: And the book, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Burn it.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Quit moving.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: Did he say anything about me?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Escaping. You ever hear of St. Rose?
It’s on the coast. They say it’s a paradise. They’ve even got electric
lights.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Between the three of us, we could –</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: No, no. I can’t. I like it here. I like
being a part of something.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: One of you dogs has earned himself a treat.
Over there.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Those men hunted themselves a lion this
morning. Must’ve been a zoo around here before the war. Anyhow, they
shot him and he crawled into that thicket. A third man went in after
him. We don’t know if he’s dead or alive. I need a volunteer. Someone’s
gotta go in and get our boy out.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: I guess size ain’t a measure of courage, is
it? Shakespeare!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I don’t think so, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Come out alive and you got yourself a
lion steak.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Maybe you’ll find your St. Rose up there.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: What are you waiting for, Christmas?</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Why are you stopping?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I found him.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: He alive?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Bring him out.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: In the water. Come back without him and
you and another man will die in his place.</p>
<p><strong>conscripts</strong>: Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: I’ll get him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Just let me go. I don’t want to be part
of your army.</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: My army. I like the sound of that.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>bandit #20</strong>: I got him! Over –</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: They sent me to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Good, boy. Get him.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: It’s you or me.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: Finish it.</p>
<p><strong>woody</strong>: No harness on my back.</p>
<p><strong>idaho</strong>: You want your St. Rose?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Hey. How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Jerry Ball, Pine View.’</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: So, arrest me. Here’s a piece of good
news. Jerry’s decided to go to school to get his contractor’s
license.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know
he lost a tooth.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thanks for being there for me. Here’s
to you. I consider my taxes very well spent.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: All dressed up. Nowhere to go.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Well, that’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Greetings, Pine View, Oregon!</p>
<p><strong>sentry #1</strong>: Just head back the way you came. Pine
View ain’t buying, ain’t listening and don’t give charity.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Civilian, I’m on official business. I
demand entry into the town of Pine View.</p>
<p><strong>sentry #2</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m through talking to you, buddy boy!
Now get somebody with authority to open this gate!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: I’m Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are
you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m a representative of the United
States Government –</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Authorized by order 417 of the restored
Congress to reestablish a communication route to Idaho and lower Oregon.
Now open that damn gate!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: What does that mean in English?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m your postman!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Hand me your gun.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Understand that tampering with or
obstructing the mail is a federal offense. Furthermore, the Bolin Act
requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and
nourishment. Now open that damn gate!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You got three seconds to get your ass outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Is Jerry the contractor here?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Wait! I’m going to get something out of
my bag.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: One!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Paul Davis! 124 Vernon Street!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Never heard of him. Two!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Lois Kent! 14 Weymoth Lane!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Three!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Irene March! 478 River Road!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: Did he say my name?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: I’m Irene March.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I have a letter for you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: Would you read it?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m sure it’s personal.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: Please. Someone has to.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We’re delivering the old stock piles,
but I’ll accept all new correspondence as well.</p>
<p><strong>townie</strong>: Just read it, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Dear Irene. Sorry I haven’t written.
Everything’s so crazy. The strange weather. The food shortages. That
farmer Nathan Holn causing all that trouble. It’s hard to understand.
David’s home from the Army. The war was over before he even got there.
Thank God for that. He’s still my baby no matter how big he gets. We’re
going to miss you for Christmas, but maybe next year. All our love.
Donna.’</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: My sister in Denver. Fifteen years ago.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: You’re a Godsend. A savior.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No. I’m just… a postman.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’ve been on the road a while. I could
use a little something to eat –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: Oh, yes, absolutely… Is there anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yes, there is! If there are dogs in
this town, you have to leash them while I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Stop. Oh, yes, wait a minute,
Mr. Postman. Waaa-ait, Mr. Postman…’</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Cleaned and pressed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thanks. Didn’t somebody say something
about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Yeah, I’m supposed to take you to Foster’s. My
name’s Ford. Ford Lincoln Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Used to be John Stevens, but I changed it on
account of I want to drive cars.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I live in that car. A 2003 Pontiac Sinatra.
With a nine- banger and a Q-eight.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: V-eight. Eight cylinders. That means an
eight-banger.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Were they fast?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A buck seventy-five on a strip.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: A buck seventy-five? I thought maybe I could
fix some of them up. It’s nothing compared to what you do.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The important thing to remember about
cars is, you can’t eat ’em.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Tell us about the government!</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Yes, tell us everything!</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Is there a President?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You know, I’m pretty hungry.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: His name is, uh… Richard Starkey. From
Maine. He has a saying. ‘Things are getting better, getting better all
the time.’</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: He a Democrat or a Republican?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Parties are over with. The individual
is what counts. You vote for the best man.</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: What about Europe? Any word?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Lady Di’s in charge. Sixty years old
and she still kicks ass.</p>
<p><strong>woman #3</strong>: Is Nathan Holn still alive?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: He died. Skin cancer.</p>
<p><strong>woman #4</strong>: And the Holnists? They’re still out there.
What’s the government going to do about them?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The government’s just getting started.
You’re on your own for at least eighteen months.</p>
<p><strong>man #5</strong>: What about the Marines Corp?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Be quiet, everyone! Can’t we just let this
man eat?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Never thought I’d hear myself say this,
but I can’t eat anymore.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Almost fits.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That’s not a toy, honey. That’s very
important. Give it back.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Would you like to dance?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t know if I can, I think I’m
still on duty.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: All you got to do is hold on.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How tall are you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: About six feet.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Are you smart?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Smarter than some I guess. Why?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad
mumps?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Never had the bad mumps.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Have you ever had herpes or syphilis or
anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: So as far as you know, you have good
semen?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Is that a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t mean to be nosy. I’m only asking
because I want you to make me pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s got to be the uniform.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: This is my husband. Michael.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We’ve been trying to have a baby for three
years. We can’t on account of Michael had the bad mumps when he was
twelve. So we need a body father. We could ask a man here, but it could
cause trouble. I’ve seen it happen. Things go okay until the woman
starts to show. Then it can be bad. But you’ll only be around once in
awhile with the mail.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He hasn’t said ‘no’.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What do you say, mister? You’d be doing us
a favor.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’ll have to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>townie #1</strong>: Mrs. March wants to give you something.
He’s right here, Irene.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: It’s to my daughter Annie. She left five
years ago. She was only fifteen. The last I heard, she was living up
north…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Look, Mrs. March, you should know
that…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Know that…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. march</strong>: I have a feeling about you. I know
you’ll do what’s right.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It’s right around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I knew you’d come here.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You did, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How do you get to be a postman, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You have to be in the right place at
the right time.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: How could I do it?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I thought you wanted to drive cars.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Not anymore. That was kid’s stuff. This is
real. So, where’s the right place?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Could be anywhere. Anytime. Only
another postman can make you a postman.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Kinda like vampires, right?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Something like that. You have to be
sworn in.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The organization’s kinda shaky. It
might not last.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What does?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’d meet a lot of people who don’t
believe in you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll set them straight.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It’s a lonely job.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ve been lonely all my life.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: So have I, Ford. So have I.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What the hell? Repeat after me.</p>
<p><strong>postman/ford</strong>: Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor
gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their
appointed rounds.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No, no, no, I’m saying that. You just
listen… By my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail.
Congratulations, you’re a postman.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I want you to know I’d die to get a letter
through.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Johnny, why don’t you run along. I need to
speak to this man.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Sure thing, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Johnny’s real impressed with you. Whole
town’s real impressed with you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I take it you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Smarter than you look.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What can I do for you, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You can clear out. Or I can throw you out.
Either way suits me fine.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m afraid you don’t understand,
Sheriff. I’m a government employee. Authorized by –</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You’re not authorized by shit. You’re
nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my
town.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This is going in my report.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: These people don’t need dreams,
Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn
Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? Didn’t think so. All you
cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken
hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I
don’t ever want to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Just leave it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I said leave it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Hello, Abby.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’ll be leaving tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Everybody’s up late writing letters for you to
take. We’re not supposed to waste candles like that, but they’re so
excited.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How about you? Do you have a
letter?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t have anybody to write to.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’ll find you a pen pal. Someone with
interests similar to your own. Dancing, checking for mumps.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re funny. Hardly anyone’s funny around
here.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I guess no one feels much like
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Have you decided yet?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Oh, well, I’ve been thinking about
it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: God, you’re beautiful. Sorry, I know
you’d probably like to keep things more clinical. You don’t even know my
name.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It would be easier for me if you closed your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What about those?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty
miles east. I thought I could take them.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Okay. They’re yours.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: I’m your escort out of town.</p>
<p><strong>citizen #1</strong>: We took a vote, Mr. Postman. We want you
to have this horse.</p>
<p><strong>citizen #2</strong>: Now don’t say no. A man on horseback can
cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>citizen #3</strong>: There’s a bedroll, some oats and a
week’s rations.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>citizen #1</strong>: Where do you figure you’ll go from
here?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Go?… Oh yeah… I’ll head west, then work
my way back here in a sort of figure eight.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Times seem hard right now. But you have
to believe it’s getting better. Birds are migrating again. The rains are
back.</p>
<p><strong>ellen &amp; town</strong>: ‘Oh beautiful for spacious skies,
for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain’s majesty, above the
fruited plain. America…’</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You got a helluva nerve, whoever you
are.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Is Abby around?</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: She and Michael are working the north
meadow this morning.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Well, you’re on your own.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Hey! Are you really who you say you
are?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: If I come back with some mail, you’ll
know!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Eugene. Benning. Portland. Boston!
Seattle. Boise… St. Rose, Paradise on the Pacific…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Maybe one thing can still be sacred.
All in all, not a bad gig, huh?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Holnists! Holnists are coming!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: They don’t usually look at me.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Who’s responsible for that?!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of
sight.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m a postman. And I’m not hiding from anyone.
I –</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You stay out of this, or I’ll lock you up
myself damnit.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You. You’ll be responsible. Get him a
torch.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Set that flag on fire.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Now throw it through the window of your
‘post office.’</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: The United States doesn’t exist. That
flag is an abomination.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: General Bethlehem. We’re gathering the
tribute, sir. Can I take your wagons?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Make sure that fire doesn’t go out.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a
first-rate piece of ass.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced.
She does not belong in a mudhole like this.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You again?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s my wife, General. She’s a married
woman.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Do you know what system of government we
have here, son? A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and
vassals. That’s you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a
vassal got married, it was the lord’s right, his right, to sleep with
the bride on the wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Me and Abby have been married for three
years.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Sorry, but I wasn’t invited to the
wedding. Now, you’ve already done me one favor, son. Don’t let this be a
black mark on an otherwise perfect record.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: We’ll be civilized about this. I want you
to give me your blessing.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sir, I can’t. You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Can’t? I’m tired of can’t. We had a great
nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak
came along. The ‘I can’ts’ destroyed us. But I’m going to make us strong
again. I’m going to be the father of a new nation. Do you know why it
will be me?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Because I can!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Michael!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: You didn’t have to –</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Didn’t have to what, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Your people seem seditious. You seem
seditious.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Aw, Michael…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What am I seeing here? I’m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Man came through here. With mail. Said he
was a postman. Said the government had been restored back east.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What government?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The United States government.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Which way did he go? Do not make me ask
again.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: East.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Send a patrol east. Send three more
south, north and west. They’d better find him east.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I managed to save these.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Take that thing off, Johnny. You want to
die, too?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m headed south. With the mail.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Don’t be a damn fool.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What kind should I be?… Haw!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Rachel Clark! Charlie Sykes! Graham
Druitt!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: G.D. died last winter of flu.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s it for now, folks. There’ll be
more once a real system is in place.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tell us about President Starkey!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What about New York City? Did they survive
the plague?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Survive? They got Broadway up and
running again. There’s a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn’t
believe.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: How much is it to mail a letter?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: A buck seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: That sounds awful cheap.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The catch is the only currency
recognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar
bills. Look for Thomas Jefferson. Of course, food is always acceptable
as barter.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: They won’t open the gates, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: They say they got a representative of the
restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say
–</p>
<p><strong>chubby sentry</strong>: Drop dead and go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: The Romans had an expression they used to
scare their children. ‘Hannibal ad portas!’ – Hannibal is at the gates.
Do you know who Hannibal was? Of course not. A pretty girl like you
wouldn’t know a thing. Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open
that gate.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: What the hell are you doing?! Open the
gates!</p>
<p><strong>skinny sentry</strong>: Government’s restored! We don’t have
to take their crap anymore!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Idiots!</p>
<p><strong>citizen #1</strong>: They’re gonna kill us all.</p>
<p><strong>chubby sentry</strong>: No! Let’s fight them!</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: With what? We got five guns maybe 20 rounds
of ammo in the whole town! How do we fight them with that?!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You don’t. Negotiate a settlement. Give
them extra supplies.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Okay. You’re a government rep. You go tell
them.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Make it quick. I’ve got an attack to
coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: General, um, they’ve asked me to
negotiate a peace treaty.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t think so, sir. I –</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’re the Postman, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: The restored United States. Do these
people really believe that shit? Who are you really?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I am a United States Postman.
Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to –</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I was at the Battle of Georgetown. I
watched the White House burn to the ground. Don’t try to sell me on any
restored U.S…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The new capital is based in
Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome. You know, where the
Vikings used to play?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’re funny. Now, what are the
terms?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: They’ll open the gate and give you
double what they usually give. Just don’t hurt anybody. This was all a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Appreciate your offer, Postman. Problem
is, you’re in no position to negotiate. These people made it through the
bugs and the riots and the three year winter. But they’re not going to
survive you.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law six, justice can be dictated. Kill
him. And kill the restored United States with him.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: In accordance with law eight and by the
authority of Emergency Order 46, you are hereby –</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Get her.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Colonel Getty!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: We can’t stop now. They’ll be coming after
us.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Abby…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>sixth soldier</strong>: If you’d had a bullet, you’d a used
it by now.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t think I ever had water soup
before. Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand? Dirt? Wood?
A twig garnish?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You used to think I was funny.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: They killed Michael.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How sorry are you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What’s with you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You got the mark of eight on you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: A mark doesn’t mean I’m a –</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re a liar. I should’ve let you die.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Then, why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You were with Bethlehem. Does that make
you one of them?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Don’t make me use this.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Wind’s come up. Getting colder too.
Must be another storm –</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I didn’t mean for you to –</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Your legs are going to rot off if you don’t
try to walk.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m hurt.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re lazy.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Lazy?! I got a hole in my stomach. I’m
weak. The two big meals around here are grass and snow. And we’re
running out of grass.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re not leaving me here, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: This is the last of it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Give me a break…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m going to check the pass.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Why are you in such a hurry to get out
of here? I can think of worse places. And worse company to –</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You can’t play tic-tac-toe with
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I told you that’s all there was.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s why you should have it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I knew you could walk.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re weird, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We walked on the moon once, Abby.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: So? What good is that now?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Obviously you’ve forgotten Tang and
microwave ovens. Your face looks pretty.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Not so bruised.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Look, there’s something you’d better know.
You’re going to find out soon enough. I’m pregnant. It’s Michael’s baby.
You’re just the body father.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How do you know it’s mine and not
Bethlehem’s?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He tried with me almost every night. He
couldn’t do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Abby.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What is it? What’s wrong? Is it the
baby?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: The pass is clear. It’s time to go.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You got our stuff out.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Of course? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I set the fire.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Am I missing the point here?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You didn’t think we’d stay here forever, did
you? I’d appreciate if you’d walk with me long enough to find someplace
safe for the baby. Then we can split up. You shaved.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It looks nice.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re really weird, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Have you ever heard of St. Rose,
Abby?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’ve heard people talk. I’ve heard lots of
names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it’s a
fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: He’s wrong. St. Rose is out there. And
I’m going to find it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: But you’re The Postman.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Look, I’m nobody, Abby. I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This is what I hate. Strangers. Do you
say ‘hi’ or do you blow their head off? Do they want to share what they
got or take what you have? And if they want to take, how far are you
willing to go to stop them? Damn it. All right. That’s far enough.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>rider</strong>: Me neither, mister.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What are you?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Carrier 18. U.S. Postal Service. Got any
mail?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Ain’t you heard of The Postman?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No, tell us.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: He’s only the greatest man who ever lived.
He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the
eye of General Bethlehem himself. He’s back east with President Starkey
right now.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Who told you all this?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. He’s in
direct contact with the restored congress.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Direct contact… I don’t believe
this.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Do you have mail, or don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You said Carrier Eighteen. That mean
there’s eighteen of you?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Thirty-two. As of midnight.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: You got another letter?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: More recruits?</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: Seven of them. They’re coming from
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Did you get a letter or didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Gather ’round, everybody. Got another letter
here. Came in last night.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What’s all this?</p>
<p><strong>young carrier</strong>: Postman sent Ford another letter.
He’s gonna read it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: ‘Hello, all postal carriers.’</p>
<p><strong>carriers</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m here in Minneapolis with President
Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can
be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot.
Signed, The Postman.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: His letters are always kind of short.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Hold on now. There’s a P.S… Anybody know what
P.S. stands for?</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>red</strong>: That would be H.S., Chubby.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: I seen him once when I lived in Benning.
It’s The Postman!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: P.S. Ford knows what to do.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Guess you want to talk about this?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: I found him! I found him!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: President Starkey? Minneapolis? Ford
knows what to do?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I thought you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: So? I’m not making the connection.
What’s all this then?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I lied. I told people you were in contact with
me.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Because I didn’t want it to end.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t know how long I can stay, Ford.
President Starkey will send word one day and I’ll have to move on.
Understand?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Sure. But you’ll stay till he sends word?
Right?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Aw, don’t do that. Hands down.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You’ll stay ’til President Starkey sends word,
right? Right?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah, till he sends word, right.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Could you say a few words?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Two plus two equals four.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: We bring all the mail here first. We sort it,
group it and then it goes out. So far we got thirty routes.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You spelled tyranny wrong.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Boy, he’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail/recruits</strong>: Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Seventy-five, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Can you ride?</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Nope. Can’t walk too good, either.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: I know stuff.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: When did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: 1970. A girl with eyes as big as saucers
did me in a little town called Saigon.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Abby –</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Ford wants me to have his trailer. Said
it’s the best one.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m on the other side of town.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I got plenty of room here.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: So much for the uniform theory.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What do you think, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Can’t tell what it is if you stand too close.
The colors all kinda run together, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Well, if it isn’t our old friend the
U.P.S. man.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: We captured him on the Oregon border.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>carrier</strong>: Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal
Service.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I want the camp struck at dawn. We’re
moving north.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You spelled tyranny wrong.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I wish they’d stop saluting.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Just stay safe and remember. The
mailman’s more important than the mail.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Boy, he’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: For President Starkey and the First
Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal
Station 10… What’s the name of this town?</p>
<p><strong>young leader</strong>: We never named it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I officially declare Postal Station 10
in Elvis, Oregon, open for business!</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: I missed him.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Phil, this better not be another of your
U.F.O.’s.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m back! And I got mail.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to
whoever brings you in. Dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thank God it wasn’t a carton of
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: I’d have shot you myself.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Things are getting better. Getting better
all the time. I don’t know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about
you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Got a letter for you, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: It’s from my sister. I thought she was
dead.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You thought wrong.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Tell me about the baby, Abby. I want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Births and deaths, the weather, gossip.
There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Nothing? Everything is here. Am I the
only one who sees that? Get out!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Give the people back their hope and their
dreams won’t be far behind.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What is it, Getty?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: A military man, especially a commander,
should keep a journal. After he’s gone, it’s the only real defense
against the slander that arises.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Who do you talk to?</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Not a soul in seven years of trying. But
I will.</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Go ahead. Take a look. Want some?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: No. No thanks. Hey, don’t let the kids
see that.</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: I was an aerospace engineer. I helped
design the Galileo space station. I dream it’s orbiting Earth forever.
With a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other. Laughing at us
down here.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It’s Red. He’s overdue.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That makes five. All on Southern
routes.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: No. No. Not him. No. Children. I want a
man and you bring me children!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Not yet. General wants the message to get
back.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Tell me about the other stuff you
know…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Ford, I want you to get rid of the
bodies. I don’t want these people blamed for what we did.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: Halt! Identify yourself!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Postage due…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You want a war? I’ll give you a war. I
was born for it!</p>
<p><strong>ford/recruits</strong>: Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of
night. Through bandit’s hell, through fire fight. Through flood and
plague we cannot fail. No Holnist trash will stop the mail.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Get this mail sorted. Bring me a fresh
horse. Something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: And all the mail going South!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: They changed the oath.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ford’s idea.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Figures. They don’t think to ask who
they’re replacing. Or why.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sir? It’d be an honor if I could shake your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You look like… Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Well, good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Nice kid. Probably be dead in a
week.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’re exhausted. You need rest. There’s food
in the trailer –</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Route twenty-two. I’m already an hour
late.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re grounded. Get off the horse. You
know the rule.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: What rule?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Twenty-two’s too far south.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: But they’re waiting on their mail down
there.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Get off the goddamn horse.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Tie him off to this one.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You can’t keep doing this.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Riding all the routes. You’re not saving
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Did I ever tell you how I got to be a
postman, Abby? I don’t know if you’d laugh or cry.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Ready!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: The post office, General?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: No. Let it stand. All by itself. So it
can remind them what it cost them.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Aim!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You think you can ride? Then today’s your
lucky day.</p>
<p><strong>bloodied carrier</strong>: Bethlehem says…</p>
<p><strong>bloodied carrier</strong>: … he’s… headed north. He’s gonna
kill ten people in every town. Then burn it to the ground. For what you
did…</p>
<p><strong>bloodied carrier</strong>: He said to tell you Pine View’s on
his way. He said he’d wait there, but not for long. I was so scared,
sir… I thought they were going to kill me, too… I wish they would
have…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m going to stop this.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Get out of my way, Ford. All of
you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: They’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Goddamnit –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: You can’t help them!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: There’s still time, Ford!</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: You’re hurting him.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: No, this is all my doing. I went against your
orders.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury
them. But I didn’t. I sent Bethlehem the bodies.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Because Bethlehem has to know that we’re not
going to stop.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: God damn you, Ford. Those people down
there are dying because of us. Because of what we did.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Bullshit. They’re dying because of Bethlehem.
They’re dying because this is a shitty world. And if we’re ever going to
change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me
down there I would. But I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: My God, what have I done? We don’t even
know their names…</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: We know their names. The little one’s my
brother. His name is Billy.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn’t
change anything for any of us. Does it?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: He’s out there somewhere. Watching. I can
feel it.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You feel it too, don’t you? Didn’t have
to end like this, Sheriff. He knew where I’d be if he wanted to face me
like a man. Instead, he’s hiding like a rabbit. So much for your
Postman.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Ready! Aim!</p>
<p><strong>briscoe</strong>: Ride, Postman! Ride! You hear me? I said
ride!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ford thinks you’re going to do something.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: If I don’t, those kids are going to
keep on getting themselves killed.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Ford doesn’t know what it means to be a kid.
He doesn’t have your memories. None of them do. All they’ve got is the
lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What? Being a postman? It’s all
bullshit, Abby. All of it. I took this uniform off a skeleton to stay
warm. I made up the rest to stay fed. There is no restored United
States.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I knew it was something like that.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Weird thing is, being a Postman was
almost the best thing that ever happened to me… Remember this? You left
it behind that night.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I remember…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I always liked to think you left it on
purpose. But maybe you just forgot it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Is this everybody?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The rest are on the overdue list.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This is everybody. Got a letter from
President Starkey.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Greetings all carriers.’</p>
<p><strong>carriers</strong>: Greetings, President Starkey!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘I’ve been in contact with The Postman.
I’ve received all the reports. I’m proud of you all.’</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: In dark days, in a weary world, you
gave everything and asked for nothing. You beat back despair and
replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. But
the price is too high. I won’t see anymore of my bravest die. It is my
duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States.
You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to
Minneapolis at once. Thank you and that is all.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: The President never wrote that letter.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: If he could’ve that’s what he would
have said.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Who’s the other letter to?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Bethlehem. I’m taking it to him in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Mail’s private. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It says it’s over. It says we quit.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: It says you quit. What about the oath?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Tell me something, Ford. How much mail
can a dead postman deliver? It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Then I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I can’t trust you.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: If this is the end. If this is the last piece
of mail that ever gets delivered. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Whoever takes this letter probably dies
for it.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m still a postman. You owe it to me… I owe
it to me.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m going to St. Rose, Abby. And I’m
taking you with me. I know you don’t want to hear it, but that’s my
child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right
to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thought I recognized you.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: General Bethlehem said… … You should be on
your knees when I do it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t give a damn what that asshole
said.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: The general is a great man.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The general is a fucking lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You don’t own a thought in that goddamn
head of yours, do you? You want to see a man?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s a man.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You don’t understand, do you? You never
will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price
for it.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You ready?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re a better man than Bethlehem,
Luke. I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Guess Minneapolis is that way.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We can’t help you. We’re just as lost
as you are.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Good lord, what do we have here?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: I’m a representative of the restored United
States –</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: He’s got a letter. Says The Postman sent
it.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: A letter?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: ‘Bethlehem. This letter is my testimony
to the fact that there is no restored United States and there is no
Postal Service.’ Then who the hell have we been fighting…? ‘My carriers
are returning home. In exchange, I’m asking you to let them be. The
Postman.’</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: He expects me to believe this?</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: It’s true, sir. I was there. He disbanded the
carriers and rode west.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Traitor…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Then I’ve won. I’ve won.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You were supposed to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: I couldn’t get close enough. This one’s his
second in command.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Why doesn’t that surprise me?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Bring out the one we found yesterday.
They can die together.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>cal carrier</strong>: Name’s Clark. Postal Carrier of the
restored Republic of California. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>cali carrier</strong>: It’s an honor.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Wait a minute… wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Hold your fire! You don’t know each
other? This will never be over. It’ll go on except I’ll be fighting a
goddamn ghost.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Should we fire, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: No goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: No, I won’t fight a ghost. Tabula rasa,
gentlemen. A clean slate. I want all mail carriers hunted down. I want
The Postman found. I want him dealt with. Colonel, organize the scouts.
He rode west?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I don’t know him. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Where do you think he came from?</p>
<p><strong>squatter</strong>: Howdy. Welcome to sunny California.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>squatter</strong>: Little accident. The ground started to
shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went… … ‘Poof.’ Destroyed
everything for miles. But the sunsets are beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You ever hear of a city called
St. Rose?</p>
<p><strong>squatter</strong>: Friend, I’ve never heard of St. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>squatter</strong>: Hey, don’t go! I got Monopoly in the
house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad!</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: You think that’s President Starkey?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: President lives in a white house. That
guy’s place is gray.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We can rest in there.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m hungry, Postman.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Set the rifle on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: This old thing? It isn’t even loaded.
Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: You’re in Bridge City. Where we don’t
allow guns.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Sentry said you were coming.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I know you. You’re famous.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: I was once. Not anymore. Are you looking
to cross?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We will be. Right now, we’d just
appreciate some food. I got some kids behind me, too.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Three. Hey, guys, come on in! I know
you’re out there!</p>
<p><strong>chubby sentry</strong>: Boy, is he smart…</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: For you and your wife.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Thanks. She’s not my wife.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Let me ask you something, have you ever
heard of a town with electric lights?</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: St. Rose?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Never been. But they say it’s a ways
down on the coast.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Couple hundred miles at least. I
couldn’t say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You seem like a decent man. And these
seem like decent people.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: We try to be.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: And this seems like a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: You want to leave her?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: All of them. I’ll give you the horses
and my gear. Abby’s special. She’s strong. Probably end up running the
place.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Why don’t you take the night to think.
Decide if that’s what you really want.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: They’re looking for The Postman.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. man</strong>: No such thing anymore.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Man on the horse says there is. Says he
thinks he’s here. Says he’s coming back with friends.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. boy</strong>: What’s a postman?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You never heard of a postman?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There used to be a postman for every street in
America. They wore uniforms. And hats. Like this one…</p>
<p><strong>b.c. boy</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: My postman knew the name of every kid on my
street. He knew our birthdays. He’d even find the baseballs you’d hit
down the street. I can still see the smile on his face. The tip of his
cap – when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. Mine always
came just after school. You could set your watch by him. Unless you were
waiting on something special – like a present from somewhere far away or
a letter from your sweetheart. Then it seemed like he’d never come. I
used to think they could make time stand still.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t think we ever really understood what
they meant to us until they were gone. Getting a letter made you feel
like you were part of something bigger than yourself. No place was ever
too far away for the postman. So nobody ever had to be alone. The
postman was someone you could count on. Things just made more sense when
they were around. That’s the kind of world we used to have. A world a
lot of us took for granted. And now we’ve got this one. And it makes me
wonder – what kind of world do I want my child to live in? I want my
child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren’t just lies you
tell yourself to get through another day. I want my child, and I want my
friends – I want all of us to live in a world where you still get your
mail.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Are you The Postman?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: I’ve heard of you, man. You’re
famous.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a
sudden, I’m not wearing the right clothes.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Fact that we don’t allow ’em doesn’t
mean we don’t have ’em. We’re not stupid, after all.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I’m sorry I’ve brought this on you.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: No need to be sorry. Long as we get our
mail on time.</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Ready for duty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: The order was to burn all uniforms.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You know what to do then?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail</strong>: Talk to the people. Gather who’s willing.
Tell them it’s important. Tell them we can make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>chubby sentry</strong>: And tell ’em we’re going to kick
ass.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Yeah, tell them that, too.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: This is hard for me. Michael was the best man
I ever knew. I never thought there’d be another man I could love the way
I loved him. I don’t know why I’ve been so blessed. And I’ve tried to
find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Abby, do you think a lie can become the
truth?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I don’t know, but I believe in you. You have a
gift, Postman. I saw it back in Pine View.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You made Mrs. March feel like she could see
again. You made Ford feel like he was part of the world. You give out
hope like it was candy in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: When you come back, we’ll be waiting here for
you. So you can take us to St. Rose.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: There’s three good-sized towns up that
way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to
come.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: A lot higher than it looks, huh?</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Don’t tell anybody, but I like to ride
the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its
perks.</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Trust me, man. This’ll get you there a
lot faster.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How do I stop –</p>
<p><strong>b.c. mayor</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Good luck and
Godspeed.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Once more into the breach, dear
friends, once more. Or close the wall with our dead. In peace nothing so
becomes a man as modesty and humility. But when the blast of war blows
in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Summon up the blood. Disguise fair
nature with rage and lend the eye a terrible aspect.</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Steady, boys, steady.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: In accordance with Law Eight…</p>
<p><strong>old george</strong>: Get on with it, you floppy-eared
sonuvabitch!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: … We were outnumbered, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: A least a hundred. With guns.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: With guns? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Looks more like two hundred to me…</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Only thing worse than a coward is one who
can’t count. Lieutenant, do yourself a favor. Die well in this battle.
In my army a deserter’s life is a brief and unpleasant one.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: At last, someone with courage enough to
bring the fight to me.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the day
I’ve dreamed of.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: They’re an eager-looking bunch. Morale’s
a dangerous thing. Bring him up. I want this postman to see how the game
is played.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Stay here. No one moves until I give
the orders.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Are they surrendering?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: God, I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: My little shipping clerk.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: We’re both a couple of frauds. You know
it; I know it.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Great men are made by other great men.
Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: You’re no fucking general. You’re a
copying machine salesman. You’re not even a good painter.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Are you trying to goad me into a
fight?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Wouldn’t it be great if wars could be
fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing
right here. You and me.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Unfortunately, it doesn’t work that
way.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It does in your army.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I invoke law seven of the Laws of
Eight! Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I challenge you.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You’re not a Holnist. You’re not a member
of the clan. You don’t have the right.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I have every right. I invoke law
seven!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I challenge for leadership of the
clan!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Where do I know you from?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: ‘Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of
war.’ Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Shakespeare. The one who didn’t want to
fight.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I should’ve found a way to kill you
then. But you seemed so strong.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Law seven it is. This war is settled
here!</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: I study people. I know your problem. Do
you know why you can’t fight?</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: You have nothing to fight for. You don’t
care about anything. You don’t value anything. You don’t believe in
anything. That’s what makes me better.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: I believe in the United States Postal
Service.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Neither snow… Nor rain… Nor heat… Nor
gloom of night… Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his
appointed rounds…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: It doesn’t have to be this way. We
don’t have to kill each other. We can live together. We can –</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Law three. Mercy is for the weak.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Ford, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Law eight. There is only one penalty and that
penalty is death.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: He isn’t worth it. I’m the head of the
clan now! There are going to be new laws! Law one! No more killing!
There’s going to be peace!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Who else? Who else has a law?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Everyone has to learn how to read.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: That’s law two. Who else?!</p>
<p><strong>carrier #1</strong>: Three. Liberty and justice for all!</p>
<p><strong>luke</strong>: Four. No more tattoos.</p>
<p><strong>carrier #2</strong>: Law five. Give peace a chance!</p>
<p><strong>holnist soldier #2</strong>: Law six. Mercy is, it’s okay
sometimes!</p>
<p><strong>carrier #3</strong>: Seven! Bring back vacations!</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury? You
give us law eight.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Be a leader, Ford.</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: Law eight…</p>
<p><strong>ford</strong>: … Live and let live.</p>
<p><strong>bethlehem</strong>: Would I had bestowed that time in the
tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but
followed the arts…</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Grow like savages – as soldiers will –
that nothing do but mediate on blood.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Somebody take a letter.</p>
<p><strong>chubby</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: A letter…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Your daddy wrote to tell you that he’ll be
here as soon as he can. And that he loves you very much.</p>
<p><strong>the postman</strong>: Mail’s slow. I’ll have to see about
that.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Your daughter. Her name is Hope.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And so my father returned home after the
Holnists were defeated…</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: But he never did see St. Rose. There was too
much to be done. He’d made a promise and in keeping it – he traded one
dream for another. With no regrets. And so, in honor of my father…</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: That was me.</p>
