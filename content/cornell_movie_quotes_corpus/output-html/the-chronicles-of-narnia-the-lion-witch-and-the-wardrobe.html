<p><strong>susan</strong>: The Professor knew we were coming?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Perhaps we’ve been incorrectly labeled?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mrs. Macready?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macready</strong>: I’m afraid so. Is that it then?
Haven’t you brought anything else?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, ma’am. It’s just us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macready</strong>: Small favours.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macready</strong>: The professor is unaccustomed to
having children in his house, and as such, there are a few rules we need
to follow. There will be no shouting’ or running’, no improper use of
the dumbwaiter, NO touching of the historical artifacts and above all,
there shall be no disturbing’ of the Professor.</p>
<p><strong>radio-man</strong>: German aircraft carried out several

<p><strong>edmund</strong>: If home’s still there.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Isn’t time you were in bed?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: YES, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Gas-tro-vas-cu-lar.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is it Latin?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Is it Latin for worst game ever
invented?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We could play hide-and-seek</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: but we’re already having so much fun!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Please, please, please.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: One…two…three…four…</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Get out! I was here first!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Eight four, eighty five…</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Uh, CH… gk, ch</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Were you hiding from me?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I… I didn’t want to
scare you,</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: if you don’t mind my asking…what are you?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Why, I’m a faun! And you must be some
beardless dwarf?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m not a dwarf, I’m a girl! And actually I’m
tallest in my class.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: But you’re saying, you’re a daughter of
Eve?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, my mum’s name is Helen…</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Yes, but you are, in fact, human.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, I came in through the wardrobe in the
spare room, and-</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Narnia? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: My dear girl, you’re in it! Everything from
the lamp post, all the way to castle Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea,
every stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: This is an awfully big wardrobe</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: I’m sorry, please allow me to introduce
myself, my name is Tumnus</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! extends hand I’m
Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake it!</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I-I don’t know! People do it when they meet
each other.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city of War
Drobe in the far land of Spare Oom, how would it be if you came and had
tea with me?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I probably
should be getting back…</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Oh, come on! It’s not every day I get to
make a new friend! And there’s a… roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And
maybe… we’ll even break into the sardines.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, maybe for just a little while… if you
have… sardines.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: By the bucket load,</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Come Along.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Can I help you with that?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Why thank you!</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Oh… That is my father.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He had a nice face. You look just like
him.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: No, were not alike at all really.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: My father is fighting in the war.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: My father went away to war too… but that was
a very long time ago… before this dreadful winter.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Winter isn’t all bad. There’s ice skating and
snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: We haven’t had Christmas in a hundred years
here.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No presents for a hundred years?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: But, oh, you would have loved Narnia in
spring! The Dryads and the Fauns would dance all night… but we never got
tired. And oh, the music! Such music. Would you… like to hear some
now?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: yes please</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Now, are you familiar with the Narnia
lullabies?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: : No, I’m afraid I’m not</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Good, because this probably won’t sound
anything like one.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh I must go</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: It’s too late for that now I’m such a bad
faun</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No. You’re the nicest faun I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: Then I’m afraid you’ve had a very poor
sampling.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m sure you’re very sorry, and you’ll never
do it again.</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: It’s not something I have done, Lucy
Pevensie. It’s something I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: I’m kidnapping you. It’s the White Witch,
the one that makes it always winter, and never Christmas. She told me
that I If I ever was to come across a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve,
I am supposed to turn it over to her!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But I thought you were my friend</p>
<p><strong>tumnus</strong>: We must move quietly the woods are full of
her spies, even some of the trees are on her side</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I think so. Keep it, you need it more than I
do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Go… Come on, go!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: 98, 99, 100… Ready or not here I come.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m back, I’m back, it’s alright,</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Shhh, he’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, I’m not sure if you two have quite
gotten the idea of this game!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: but weren’t you wondering where I was?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: That’s the point! That’s why he was seeking
you!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Does this mean I win?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think Lucy wants to play anymore.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The only wood in here is the back of the
wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: One game at a time Lu, we don’t all have your
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But I wasn’t imagining!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: that’s enough</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Well I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Yah, didn’t I tell you about the football
field I found in the bathroom closet?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why don’t you just stop it, you always have
to make everything worse. Grow up!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Shut up! You think you’re dad, but you’re
not!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: well, that was nicely handled!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It was really there…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Susan’s right. That’s enough..</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Lucy, Lucy. I hope you’re not afraid of the
dark</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Yah!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: What is it Ginarrbrik?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: He won’t let go!</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Is that how you address the Queen of
Narnia?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Well, you shall know her better
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Wait! What is your name
Son-of-Adam?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Edmund, your majesty.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: And how was it, Edmund, that you came
to enter my dominion?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I walked through a wardrobe following my
sister.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Your sister? How many are you?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: four</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit
with me here on my sledge. Now, would like something warm to drink.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Yes…your majesty. a green drop on snow that
become a hot How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I can make anything you like.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Could you make me taller?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I can make anything you like to eat</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Turkish Delight</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I’d love to see your family</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: They’re nothing special</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I have no children of my own and you
are such a good little boy where I could see, one day, you becoming
prince of Narnia - maybe even king.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Of course you’d have to bring your
family.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: They’re nothing special</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Oh, Peter will be king too?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: No! But a king needs servants.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I-I guess I could bring ’em.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Beyond these woods, do you see those
two little hills? My house is right between them. You’d love it there
Edmund, it has whole rooms simply stuffed with Turkish Delight!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Couldn’t I have some more now?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: NO! Don’t want to ruin you
appetite.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I’m going to miss you Edmund. But we
are going to see each other soon.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Until then…dear one.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! I saw Mr. Tumnus again
and he’s fine!!! The White Witch hasn’t found out about him helping
me!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: The White Witch?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, but she
really isn’t. Edmund? Are you okay? You look awful.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Well what do you expect! It’s freezing! How
do we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Come on…this way.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Peter, Peter wake up! It’s there, it’s really
there!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lucy, what are talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Narnia! It’s all in the wardrobe, like I told
you!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh Lucy, you’ve been dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No I wasn’t, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! Oh, and
this time - Edmund went too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You saw the faun?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, he didn’t actually go there with me.
What were you doing Edmund?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I-I was just playing along. You know what
little children are like these days, they just don’t know when to stop
pretending</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macready</strong>: You children are one shenanigan shy
of sleeping’ in the stable- oh, Professor! I told them you were not to
be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh, it’s alright Mrs. Macready - I’m sure
there’s a logical explanation. But I think this one needs some hot
chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. macready</strong>: Yes Professor. Come on, dear.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Ahem into his office and the Professor
sits at his desk and takes some tobacco out of it’s silver apple case
and puts it</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: You seem to have upset the internal
balance of my housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We are very sorry sir, it won’t happen
again.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s our sister sir, Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>prof</strong>: The weeping girl?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes sir, she’s upset.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Hence the weeping</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We can handle it!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Oh, I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: She thinks she’s found a magical land in the
upstairs wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What did you say!?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she’s
found a forest inside.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Like talking to a lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, not her - the forest!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re-you’re not saying you believe her?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: No, not her - the forest!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You….you actually believe her?</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, logically it couldn’t possibly be
there!</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: What do they teach at these schools?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Edmund said they were only pretending</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: And he’s the more truthful one is he?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, this would be the first time.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Well then, id your sister isn’t lying and
isn’t mad then logically we must assume that she is telling the truth.
She’s your sister, isn’t she? You’re a family! It’s high time you start
acting like one!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Can’t we play hide and go seek again?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought you said that it was a kid’s
game.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Besides, we can all use the fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Not like there’s air inside</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you ready then?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well done, Ed!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: You bowled it!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You have got to be joking.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s probably just your
imagination</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t suppose saying we’re sorry would
quite cover it?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No, it wouldn’t. But this might!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Ow! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You little liar!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: You didn’t believe her either!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Apologize to Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Say you’re sorry!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Alright! I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: That’s alright, some little children just
don’t know when to stop pretending.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: : Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Maybe we should go back</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Can’t we at lease take a look around?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think Lucy must decide!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well Mr. Tumnus it is</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We can’t just walk around in these
clothes!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We can use these coats.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Peter, they don’t belong to us.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well I don’t think the professor will mind.
And if you think about it logically we are not even taking them out of
the wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: But that’s a girl’s coat!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>end of line of lucy</strong>: …and tea and…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Who would do something like this?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Peter what is that on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>peter reads</strong>: The Former occupant of these premises,
the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and awaiting his trial on a charge of
High Treason against her imperial Majesty Jadis, Queen of Narnia,
Chatelaine of Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands, also to

with Humans. signed Maugrim, captain of the Secret Police, Long live the
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Now we should really go.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But we have to help him!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s out of our hands now Lu.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: You don’t get it do you? I’m the human!!! He
helped ME!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe we should call the police</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: These are the police!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Besides, he’s a criminal!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t worry Lucy, we’ll think of
something</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Psst!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did that bird just ‘psst’ us?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: It’s a beaver.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Here, boy clicks come here…clicks</p>
<p><strong>mr.beaver</strong>: Well, I ain’t gonna smell it if that’s
what you want!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: It’s a talking beaver!</p>
<p><strong>mr.beaver</strong>: Lucy Pevensie?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Tumnus. He gave it to me just before
they took him.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Is he alright?</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Further in.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Peter, we don’t know what you are doing.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: She’s right. How do we know we can trust
this beaver?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He say’s he knows the faun.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He’s a beaver…he shouldn’t be saying
anything!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Is everything alright?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes. We were just talking</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: That’s better left for safer
corners.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He means the trees.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: There is home sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Merely a trifle.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Is that you Beaver? I find out you’ve
been out with Badger again I’ll…Oh, they’re not Badgers. I never thought
I would see this day</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: I would have given you a week if I
thought it would help</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Well you must be cold and hungry. Let’s
get you inside for some food and civilized conversation.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Enjoying the scenery, are we?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Fish and sticks, dear.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: is there nothing we can do about
Mr. Tumnus?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: well.. there’s hope!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Yeah, there’s a load full of hope… Aslan
is on the move.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Who’s Aslan?</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Aslan….you silly little blighter…..you
don’t know do you?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Well we haven’t actually been here very
long</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: He’s only the king the whole wood, the
true king of Narnia…. and he’s waiting for you!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: waiting for us?</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: You got to be joking! Look, Aslan’s return,
Tumnus’ arrest…..the secret police! They’re all happening because of
you!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re blaming us?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Not blaming you dear, thanking you.</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: There’s….a prophecy, When Adam’s flesh and
Adam’s bone sits in if Cair Paravel in throne the evil is over and
done.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know that doesn’t really rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: I know, but you’re missing the
point!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: It’s long been told that two sons of
Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear to defeat the White Witch, and
restore peace to Narnia.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: And you think we’re the ones???</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Well you’d better be, Aslan’s already
fitted out your army!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think you’ve made a mistake; we’re not
heroes!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We’re from Finchley!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I think it’s time we were going.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: But what about Mr. Tumnus?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry Lucy. It’s out of our hands.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Thank you for your hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ed, time to go- Ed? I’m going to kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: You may not have to…Has Edmund been to
Narnia before?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Edmund!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Shh! They’ll hear ya!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We just can’t let him go!</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: Don’t you get it?! He’s the bait! She wants
all of ya in there!!! To kill ya!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This is all your fault! None of this would
have happened if you had just listened to me in the first place!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So you knew this would happen?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I didn’t know what would happen…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Stop, this fighting isn’t going to help
Edmund</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: She’s right. Only Aslan can save him
now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Then take us to him.</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Stand still stranger!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I’m a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in the
woods!</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: My apologies, fortunate favourite of the
queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Wait here throne, and sits on it longingly.
Then, the witch comes up behind him and says,</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: You like it!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Ye… yes, your majesty!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I thought you might</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Tell me, you sisters, are they
deaf?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: No</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: and your brother, unintelligent?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Well I think so, but mom says…</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, I
ask so little of you</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: They just don’t listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Couldn’t even do that!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I…I did bring them half way. There at the
dam at the house of the beaver’s!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Well…I guess your not a total lost
then.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Is there any chance I may have some more
Turkish delight now?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry</p>
<p><strong>ginnabrick</strong>: This way…for your num nums…</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Maugrim!!!! You know what to do….</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Take them</p>
<p><strong>mr.beaver</strong>: Hurry Mum, they are after us!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: right then…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What is she doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Don’t worry, you’ll thank you me later.
it’s a long journey and a beaver gets cranky when he’s hungry.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do you think we should bring jam?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Only if the Witch has toast.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: This should lead to Aslan’s</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: I thought it lead to your mums!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: They’re in the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: You should have brought a map!</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: There was no room next to the jam!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: He was my best mate!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: This is what happens to the enemies of the
White Witch.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Stand still there traitor.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Relax, I’m one of the good guys</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Well you look mighty like one of the bad
guys.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: An unfortunate family resemblance, but we can
discuss family breeding later right now we need to move.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Evening gents, Did we lose something?</p>
<p><strong>wolf</strong>: Don’t patronized me, I know where your
allegiance lies. We are looking for some humans</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Humans in Narnia, now that’s some valuable
information</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Where are they?!!!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: They , they , were heading North.</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Quickly, smell them out.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well, I wish I could say their bark was worse
than their bite.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Stop squirming! You’re worse than
beaver on bath day</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Worst day of the year</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Well I am afraid that is all the healing I have
time for.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: It has been a pleasure my Queen. I have been
asked by Aslan HIMSELF to gather more troops.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: You’ve seen Aslan!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: What is He like?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Like everything we have ever heard. He’ll be a
good help fighting the White Witch</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We are not planning fighting any witch</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Surely King Peter…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We just want to get our brother back.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Are you gonna eat that?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Mr… Tumnus.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Your Lucy Pevensies brother.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I’m Edmund!</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: You have the same nose.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Is your sister alright? Is she safe?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I… I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: My wolves tore that dam apart, your
little family was nowhere to be found. Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I don’t know..</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Then you are no longer any use to
me…Guard</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Wait they said something about Aslan</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Aslan! Where?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Stranger has only been in Narnia a
short…</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I left before I could hear anymore…I wanted
to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Guard!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yes, your majesty</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Release the Faun Tumnus cries out in
pain as they drop Do you know why you are here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tumnus</strong>: Because I believe in a free Narnia</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: You’re here because he turned you
in…for sweeties. Take him upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund misses
his family.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Now Aslan’s camp is just over there by
the stone table just across the frozen river.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: River?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: It’s been frozen for 100 years</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It seems so far</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: It’s the world dear, did you expect it
to be small?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Smaller…</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Come on, before we’re old</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If he tells me to Hurry up one more time I’m
going to turn him into a big fluffy hat</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Hurry up Son-of-Adam! We don’t have all
day.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: He is getting kinda bossy</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: It’s her! Run!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Maybe she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll go and have a look</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: No, you’re no good to Narnia dead.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: Neither are you Beaver.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Thanks dear.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: I hope you’ve been good, because there
is someone here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Merry Christmas, Sir!</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I thought there was no Christmas in
Narnia.</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: It hasn’t been for a hundred
years. But now the Witch’s power is crumbling.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Presents!</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: Lucy, Eve’s Daughter. These are
for you. The juice of the fire flower. If you, or one of your friends
are wounded, one drop of this cordial will restore them. And though I do
not expect you to use it, this.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, I think I could be brave enough.</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: I’m sure you could. But battles
are ugly affairs. Eve’s Daughter, Susan. Trust in this bow, for it does
not easily miss.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What happened to, ‘battles are ugly
affairs?’</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: And, though you don’t seem to have
trouble making yourself heard, this. When you put this horn to your lips
and blow it, wherever you are, help will come.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: And, Peter. These are tools, not
toys. The time to use them may be soon at hand.</p>
<p><strong>father christmas</strong>: Bare them well! I best be off,
winter is almost over and things do pile up when you’ve been gone a
thousand years. Long live Aslan!</p>
<p><strong>the children</strong>: Bye… Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Told you he was real!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you hear what he said… winter is almost
over. You no what that means… no more ice!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wait, maybe we should think about this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I was just trying to be realistic</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, you’re trying to be smart…as usual!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Wait, maybe I should go first.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe you should.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: You’ve been sneaking second helpings
haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mr beaver</strong>: Well you never know what meal is gonna be
your last, especially with your cooking.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: if mum knew what we were doing…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mum’s not here!!!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Run!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Put that down boy, someone might get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Don’t worry about me! Slit his
throat!</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Leave now while you can, and you’re brother
leaves with you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Stop Peter, maybe we should listen to
him!</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: Smart girl.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Don’t listen to him. Kill him. Kill him
now!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Look, just because some man in a red suit
hands you a sword doesn’t make you a hero! So just drop it!</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: No Peter! Narnia need ya!</p>
<p><strong>maugrim</strong>: What’s it gonna be Son of Adam? We’re not
going to wait for ever. And neither is the river.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hold onto me!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What have you done?!</p>
<p><strong>all call out</strong>: Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Has anyone seen my coat?</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Your brother has you well looked
after.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. beaver</strong>: I don’t think you’ll be needing those
coats any more!</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: It’s so warm here! I think I’ll go check the
sleigh.</p>
<p><strong>wolf</strong>: We found the traitor He was gathering troops
near the sharwood forest.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Nice of you to drop by. I understand
you were so helpful to my wolves last night.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Forgive me your majesty</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Don’t waste my time with flattery.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Not to seem rude, but I wasn’t actually talking
to you</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Where is ASLAN! Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Wait! The Beavers said something about the
Stone Table and an army.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Thank you Edmund. It is good for this
creature to see some honesty before he dies..</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Think who’s side you are on. MINE… Or
theirs? If it is a war Aslan wants It’s a war he shall get.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Why are they all staring at us?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Maybe they think you look funny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You
look lovely.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We have come to see Aslan.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Welcome Peter Adam’s son, Welcome Susan and
Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. You have my thanks, but where is
the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s why we are here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We had a little trouble along the way.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s been captured by the White Witch</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Captured!</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: He betrayed them your Excellence!</p>
<p><strong>oreius</strong>: Then he has betrayed us all</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Peace Oreius.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It is my fault really. I was too hard on
him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We all were.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Sir, he’s our brother.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I know dear and that makes the betrayal all
the worse. It may be harder than you think</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones one
of which you must sit as High King.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You doubt the prophecy</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, that’s just it…you’re not who I think I
am</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. Beaver
also said you wanted to turn him into a hat.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think I will be able.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You were able to get your family here.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not all of them.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I will do what I can for Edmund. I too want
my family safe.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mother hasn’t had a dress like this since
before the war</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk load
when we go home.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: If we go home…Sorry I guess I am like that.
Remember when we use to have fun?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yes, before you go boring.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh really</p>
<p><strong>wolf</strong>: Now, We’re very tired. We’d prefer to kill you
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Peter and Aslan</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: Susan and Lucy</p>
<p><strong>susan and lucy</strong>: Peter… no!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Follow him! He’ll lead you to Edmund. Peter,
clean your sword.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane–Knight of
Narnia.</p>
<p><strong>general otmin</strong>: The Minotaurs on the left, send in
the dwarfs first.</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: You’re not going to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Not yet! We have work to do</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: What’s done is done. There is no reason to
bring up the past with your brother.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Oh, Edmund</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I’m feeling kinda tired</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Get some rest…and Edmund try not to wander
off again.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Narnia isn’t going to run out of toast
Edmund</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: then you better pack some for the journey</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So were going home?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You are, I promised I’d keep you three safe
but there’s no reason I can’t stay and help.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: but they need us…All four of us</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lucy it’s too dangerous. You almost drowned,
Edmund was almost killed!</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Which is why we have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: I’ve seen what the White Witch can do and
I’ve helped her do it, and we can’t leave these people behind to suffer
for it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well I guess that’s it then. gets up</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: To get in some practice.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius showed
us.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Whoa horsey!</p>
<p><strong>horse</strong>: My name is Philip.</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Oh, sorry</p>
<p><strong>mr. beaver</strong>: you better come quick the White Witch
has requested a meeting with Aslan…</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Jadis.. Jadis!!!</p>
<p><strong>jadis</strong>: You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: His offence was not against you.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I
was there when it was made.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Then you will know that the boy belongs
to me. That boy will die on the Stone Table.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Come and take it then.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: You think that a simple threat will
deny me my right, little king? Aslan knows that if I do not have blood
as the law demands, all of Narnia will be overturned, and perish, in
fire and water.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Enough, I shall talk with you alone.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: The Witch has denounced her claim on
Edmund</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: How will I know your promise will be
kept?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Aren’t you suppose to be in bed?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We couldn’t sleep</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Please, Aslan. Couldn’t we come with you?</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: I would be glad of the company tonight.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: It is time. From now on, I must go on alone.
Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. And farewell.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Why doesn’t he fight back?</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Bind him. Wait. First let him be
shaved.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: Tonight, the Deep magic will be
appeased, but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: You know, Aslan, I’m a little
disappointed in you. Did you really think that by giving your life you
would save the Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your life, and saving no
one. So much for love.</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: In that knowledge… Despair… and</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: The great cat is DEAD!!</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: General, gather your army and prepare
for battle. However short it may be.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s too late. He’s gone. I’m sure he knew
what he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We can’t just leave him here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Lucy there’s not time. We have to tell the
others.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: The Trees</p>
<p><strong>dryad</strong>: Fear not my princes. I come with tidings of
grave news..</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It is true, he’s gone</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Then you’ll have to lead us. There’s a whole
army out there waiting to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can’t</p>
<p><strong>edmund</strong>: Aslan believed you could. And so do</p>
<p><strong>oreius</strong>: what are your orders?</p>
<p><strong>gryphon</strong>: They come, you highness, in numbers and
weapons far greater then our own.</p>
<p><strong>oreius</strong>: Numbers do not win a battle</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, but I bet they help</p>
<p><strong>white witch</strong>: I take no interest in prisoners. Kill
them all</p>
<p><strong>otman</strong>: Look to the sky</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you with me?</p>
<p><strong>orieus</strong>: To the death!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We should go.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: I’m so cold.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What have they done?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We saw the Witch, the knife.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: If the Witch knew the true meaning of
sacrifice, she might have interpreted the Deep Magic a little
differently. For she would know that if a willing victim who had
committed no treachery died in a traitors stead, the Stone Table would
crack and death itself would begin to unwind.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We sent the word that you were dead. Peter
and Edmund would have gone to war.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We have to help them.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: We will, but not alone. Now, climb on my
back. We have a long ways to go and little time to get there. And you
might want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!</p>
<p><strong>beaver</strong>: That’s the signal! Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Susan this is…</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Come, lets search the castle - others may
still be trapped inside and Peter will need all the help he can get.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Ed! There are too many of them! Go! Get out
