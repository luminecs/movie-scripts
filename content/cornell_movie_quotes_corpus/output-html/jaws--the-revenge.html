you find out that scuba diving’s safer than climbing into the
bathtub….</p>

mountainside….</p>

It’s a good thing to study …So we’ll always have them.</p>

respectable would hire you gents anyway…not with hair like that…a while

mischief….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I have no doubt….</p>

time….</p>

<p><strong>michael</strong>: What I do is perfectly safe. Jake and I are
scientists. One of these days we’ll be PHDs…Perfectly Harmless
Derelicts…We know what we’re doing. There’s nothing to worry about. It’s
warm water here, remember? Great whites hate it… Wrinkles their
skin…Makes them look like prunes….</p>

Princess Di and there’ll be a big Parade of Horse Guards and you’ll ride
in a golden carriage.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re coming, aren’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: Who’s coming?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No one. Nothing. We’ve got to get this
finished before the tide comes in.</p>

<p><strong>thea</strong>: My mother says that to my father.</p>
<p><strong>man in the boat</strong>: Next time don’t keep me
waiting….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Yeah…yeah…yeah….</p>

<p><strong>michael</strong>: Forget it….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Money is money….</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They put bombs on dolphins….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know a guy who got money from them to study
eels….</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Tough to put a bomb on an eel….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m busting my ass to get my degree… I’m tired
of all this paradise shit….</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I like it here….</p>
<p><strong>67-a topside - day</strong>: 67-A</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A regular tropo…Spend the rest of your life in
a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants. You want to be a bum
all your life, be my guest. Not me. I’m not growing old chasing snails

<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s not a bad life, Jake….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re afraid of the competition out
there….</p>

everything….</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s just trying to keep you from
disappearing up your own….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re nothing but a bunch of goddamn
romantics. You’re never going to amount to anything.</p>

hardly know you.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Sometimes talking to a stranger is
easier….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I…I can’t explain it. It’s just something I
feel.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: I always listen to my feelings….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sometimes I think I’m going crazy. The
nightmares….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: It could have been an accident….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It was no accident….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: I’m not saying you’re wrong, just that there
are other possibilities….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the
heart. I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew
that. I know it’s coming….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s it cost to take a ride on that
plane…?</p>
<p><strong>thea</strong>: The water’s coming in…The water’s coming
in….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Depends on where you want to go….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Doesn’t matter….</p>

this?</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Boss’ day off…Take the wheel….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I can’t….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Sure you can….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I don’t know how….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: No one does till they learn….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: If you don’t take it, we’ll be swimming in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Easy does it. Hold her gently. She’ll damn
near fly herself.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: It’s just like driving a car….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Where do I pull off…?</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: You’re doing fine. I’ll keep you out of
trouble. Relax….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’m only doing this to get out of my family’s
hair….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: One time I was flying supplies up the
Amazon. Went down in the jungle….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re not going to tell me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: Got picked up by a tribe of head-
hunters….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You’re impossible….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: They took me to the chief, who took a long
look at me, then took me in his hut….</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: The plane’s turning….</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: In the hut, sitting on a pole was a shrunken
head. My head. Me.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: It was like looking into one of those
mirrors which says, objects may be closer than they appear. Chief said,
there are two of everybody in the world and since we already have one of
you, the other one can go.</p>
<p><strong>hoagie</strong>: How do you like flying?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s wonderful….</p>

<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Your brother’s death almost killed me. I m
not sure I’ll ever get over it. But I can’t allow myself to keep on
believing it was intentional. I’m not going to let an obsession run my
life.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: It’s not easy. None of it is. I have to find
some way to get on with my life and I’m going to try. I finally figured
that out. I’m going to do my best….</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: That’s it? Good…I thought you’d break out the

forever. It’ll figure out the water’s too warm and take off. We’ll never
get this chance again…. It’s what we were trained for, for Christ’s
sake. It’s why you spent all that time on the books….</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’ll give it a few days, then it’s back to
the snails. Indulge me, Michael….</p>

Ellen Brody.</p>
