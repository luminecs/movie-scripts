<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
hundred and sixty one.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now
Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Shut up and play darling. Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Five hundred ninety two thousand seven
hundred and four.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Uh… eighty two?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Eighty four.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: You win! Okay pull over.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But… I thought…</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: If what I’ve heard is true this could be the
last time for a long long time. Besides we’ve got a whole seven minutes
before the next one. Clock’s ticking. Tick-tock…</p>
<p><strong>kirsty’s voice</strong>: Honey what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What isn’t wrong? Why are you doing this
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: I’m… I’m doing a very special thing here.
And you can’t even … respond?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Sorry honey the present situation isn’t
exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn’t we be getting to the
hospital?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: I was going to keep breathing you know. You
think I’m an amateur or something?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Just concentrate on the task at hand please.
Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: You’ve been cheating on me haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during
your last contraction.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat
start during the eighth month of their wives’ first pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I would never cheat on you. Not while you’re
pregnant now you know that.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Okay… uh oh here comes another one.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Share the pain Kirsty.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: One fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Oh God…… Trevor, I think my water just
broke.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Oh my God. It’s coming out.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Okay Kirsty don’t panic. Just keep
breathing! DON’T PANIC! Put the seat back and hold on to something. Were
almost there!</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! oh my God, Oh
my God. Trevor, It’s coming out.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: This isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Honey, take it easy. Your gonna be
alright.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kristy! Kristy!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where is she…? Where’s Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hey, what are you-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What are you people doing?!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s happening to-!</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: As you can see I just accessed the
speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability.</p>
<p><strong>chief surgeon</strong>: The goal is find the exact point in
the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and
wrong is distinguished. In exploring this Morality Center I will most
likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our patient
may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due
to pain. It is merely our patient- recalling his past…</p>
<p><strong>trevor’s pov</strong>: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle
with blackened eyes.</p>
<p><strong>angelic woman</strong>: Well? What do say Trevor? Que
pasa?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where do I start?</p>
<p><strong>angelic woman</strong>: How’s the old noggin? Any change in
the intensity?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m not sure. How about a jackhammer in the
Occipital lobe?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Are you a dream too?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Still hallucinating as well. Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What just happened to me anyway? It looked
like a dream but it felt like reality.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: It’s the morphine Trevor. You’re on so much
of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide
open.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where’s Kirsty? Where’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Your wife…?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Still a little hazy. He’s still in pain
too, even after the morphine. I recommend we admit him. At least for
another day… He just asked for his wife…</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Well I can’t find any abnormalities. I
think we’re ready for discharge.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: But, Dr. Ambrose-</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: I think it’s time to ween you off these
painkillers too. Wouldn’t want you to develop a dependency to them. You
might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to
get a fix, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well looks like you’re going home! Hope you
brought your bus pass.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Do you kids mind keeping it down?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Aww let them be. They’re only kids.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Trevor what is the metric probability of you
getting any work done at all today?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split
coconut.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Dude there is a track on the carpet between
here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You’ve been dragging it
all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Give me a break. I checked back into the
hospital- amongst other things.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Hospital? You haven’t been to the hospital
since uh…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Since what?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Look never mind. Just get some numbers going-
any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: I’m just looking out for ya.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Sixty five point three percent of all
headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: It’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Jesus what the hell was that? It’s like you
saw a ghost or something.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Come on speak up, Gooding, I’m trying to run a
business here. I can’t have people flipping out in the break room when
they should be slaving away at their desks.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Sorry I just kind of… spaced for a second
there.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Well don’t let it happen again. Or I may have
to spank you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Get back here, junior bean counter. This is
your supervisor speaking.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Please, Gwen. You’re- you’re all over
me.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: How do you think you got this job, cock? Mmm.
I’m still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: What’s wrong, Trev?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: And it shows. Least it did last night at the
quarry. In a big way.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Please you’re going way too fast for me
here.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: YOU’RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario
Andretti himself?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Gwen, my wife’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it
must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: That was cold…</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: No, making another woman compete with someone
who’s been dead eight months. That’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m sorry Gwen. I don’t know what’s
happening to me. I think it’s the painkillers, really.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: They mess with my head. Yesterday gets
blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid
technicolor. Like the accident just happened you know?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Why don’t you let me take you out tonight? I
promise to make it the most memorable night of your life.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Pick you up round seven. And Gooding? Get some
fucking work done.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You got Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from
homicide. It’s about your wife.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your
head healed okay by now?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Okay then. Here’s the scoop.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What evidence?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: For one thing there were no skid marks on
that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing
wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven
off the bridge intentionally.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It should all in the report. I told you guys
everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the
wheel and I lost control.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: I did read that, yes. What hospital were you
going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn’t exactly on the way to
Mercy General.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Why wouldn’t I tell you everything? Look,
I’ve been fully cooperative… … to my recollection.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: I’m sorry Mr. Gooding, I meant no disrespect.
I’m just doing my job here, OK? I mean between your head injury and the
fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be
remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kirsty. Jesus, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Mr. Gooding? You still in there?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to
recollect, you know?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my
wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water. Maybe she wasn’t
trapped inside.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s voice</strong>: That’s a start. I’ll tell the people
trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not. Thanks for
your help Trevor. If we have any more questions you’ll get a call from
myself or my partner Detective Givens.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You guys know something I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: All things considered we probably know a lot
less than you do. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>pov behind trevor</strong>: We see Trevor’s back from a
slight distance. Someone is following him.</p>
<p><strong>pov out window</strong>: Staring back at him, from a dimly
lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY
MAN that followed Trevor home.</p>
<p><strong>gothic woman</strong>: Here it is, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>gothic woman</strong>: I saw it on the counter, looked at the
name and the rest is history. It’s like, named after me. Well…?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Oh. Uh… it’s beautiful. I’m sorry, I’ve just
been having a weird day…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: I totally understand. Listen I don’t know if
you’re into incense but, I bought some, it’s called Witching Hour. To
inhale it is to love it. I mean the stuff’ll clear your head big time.
Come on over, I’ll burn some for you. If you can’t sleep tonight…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: … knock on my door, I’m a total
insomniac.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No, thanks I’ve got a… a date tonight-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: -Tawny.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Whew. You bounce right back don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Didn’t your like… whole life get totalled
last week?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Last week…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: The car accident? Any of this ringing a
bell?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It’s not that kind of date.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Hey even if it is more power to ya. Alrighty
then. Have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Well Trevor. It’s been one year. Three
hundred sixty five days.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Eight thousand seven hundred sixty hours.
Five hundred twenty five thousand…</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a
whole year.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: In a word? Lucrative.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: The best business decision if you ever made
I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt
work for one second.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: You know what the family lawyer told me one
our wedding day?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Never to put you in my will.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Because you’d be staying with me for me and
not because you’d get rich if I died for some reason.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But you had more wisdom than to listen to a
false prophet</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: And besides, I thought, to hell with it…
it’s okay if you only married me for my money.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Really, why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: I only married you for your body.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here,
you.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hello? Who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Sorry I’m late dear.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Gwen you scared the living shit out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You are turning into an old fuddy duddy.
Shoe.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Come on don’t make me beat you.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Other shoe.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Good boy. Where’s is it?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Our little toy. You usually have it up and
running by now.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Do I really want to know what you’re talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You’re kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m sorry Gwen. I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You have definitely got a screw loose, Trevor.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>video gwen</strong>: There’s one thing I should have told you
right from the beginning Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>video gwen</strong>: I like it pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Sorry I thought you were going to stay
under longer.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s happening to me? What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep
and well, I took the liberty of…I’m sorry. You looked like a wreck
Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I just had the most vivid dream. I was sure
I was dying.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well you can relax now you are quite alive.
And as long as you’re awake, chin up.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it’s
going through a meat grinder. I’m not sure if I’m dreaming or…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: That `poor me’ attitude doesn’t suit you
Trevor. Listen, I don’t mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be
worse. There’s one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones
life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first
time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Your insight is enlightening.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: No wisdom, no insight, no plan.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: My wife said that exact same sentence to me
the day we got married. She even winked too.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Do you use this wife thing to hit on all
the interns?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No… just you.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: There. Just like a baby’s butt.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison? Why can’t remember what happened to
my wife? Is it something I’m on that’s… that’s making me forget?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No I need to remember. Look whatever it is
take me off it. I can handle pain. I can’t handle not knowing…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You need to get better first Trevor. Way
better. It’s okay to miss somebody. It’s okay to still love someone
after they’re gone. But you’ve got to quit blaming yourself okay…?
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Trevor?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: It’s okay Trevor I’m coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Shit, I’m gonna be late!</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Must be nice.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Getting paid for doing shit.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Come on, Bret.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Seriously man, you oughta work for the
government. You’ve got the sense of urgency for it.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Look, I’m doing my best considering
okay?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Hey if the boss doesn’t notice who cares
right? Just slack all the live long day if you want.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: The boss won’t notice me doing a bad job
because I’m not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I’d know right
away.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Yeah, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I have my connections</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Really? Do tell.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Gwen.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I crap you not. She was all over me
yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night
too.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: You were supposed to have a date with Gwen
last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think
she literally fucked me brains out.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Wow that’s quite a feat Trevor
congratulations. Must be really tough to get your brains fucked out by a
CORPSE.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was
murdered here six months ago. The security guard found her all over her
office. Her head was in the waste paper basket. Her stomach was in the
filing cabinet. Her ass was on the copy machine…</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: They never found the sicko who did it…
remember?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Man are you ever out of the loop. Either that
or you’ve got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What
is your problem anyway?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind. And
now I’m finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on
the side of the road.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Bud you need to decompress. I told you you
came back to work too soon after the accident.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Hey you know what Trev? I’m going to hook you
up man. Here…</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: This woman will take one look at you and know
exactly what you need.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: These headaches you’ve been getting. Do they
happen in conjunction with the hallucinations?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yes, sort of.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TREVOR</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Dreams?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I was going to say dimensions. But I guess
technically they are dreams.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: You should always listen to your subconscious.
It’s trying to tell you something about your waking life.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But I never feel like I’m sleeping. It’s
sort of, waking narcolepsy. I’ll be somewhere and then- -it’s like I was
never wherever I was to begin with I was really somewhere else
entirely.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the
needles do the driving.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Don’t go anywhere. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m thinking this might just be what I
needed.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: No matter what happens just remember…</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: We’re all here for you Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Shh. It’s okay. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>trevor’s pov</strong>: Buried in the murky shadow, all that
can be seen are his hands, lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming through a
blinded window. A ring on the man’s left pinky finger glimmers eerily,
almost too much. We saw this man in an earlier FLASHBACK</p>
<p><strong>darkened man</strong>: I know. Divorce isn’t good enough.
Abandonment isn’t good enough. There’s only one way to do it and do it
cleanly, without leaving a trace of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>darkened man</strong>: Open this and your problem will
disappear forever. And no one will ever suspect you. A word of caution
though. A certain side effect of the box. Pleasure. Pleasures that would
redefine the parameters of sensation.</p>
<p><strong>darkened man</strong>: Once the cube is opened there is no
turning back. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Afternoon doll-face. Hey, a police
detective was just here to see you. Some guy named Givens.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Uh thanks this looks a little important.
Could you let the folks upstairs know I’ll be late?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: For you bubbalicious? I’d lay across a
bed of nails.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You know it girl. That ass is a three-
hummer baby. Mmm-mmm-mmm.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m sorry. I still… I don’t understand how
this is a homicide case. I mean nobody was murdered here… Her body’s
been missing for I don’t know how long now and…</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: What did you just say?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I said she’s been missing for-</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: No. No you said HER BODY’s been missing.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: Last time anybody saw this woman she was
alive. You seem to certain she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I saw her drowning inside the car,
detective.</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: I read up on you, man. You’re a smart guy
aren’t you? I mean with numbers. Right?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: Zero’s a number right?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where
are you going with this?</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: How many zeros was your wife worth?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I need to talk to my attorney. Now.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yes I need LARRY ELLIS’ office please.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yeah this is Trevor Gooding I need to speak
with Larry… Trevor…? Kirsty Gooding’s husband…? I see do you know when
he’ll be out that meeting? Fine I’ll uh… call back then… Okay you give
him the message and he’ll call me that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: I don’t know what pissed you off but it’s nice
to see you getting the job done for a change.</p>
<p><strong>annnouncer’s voice</strong>: -at the dawning of the agrarian
age goat’s milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother’s
breast milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and
ensure a bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual would become
associated with less hallowed purposes.</p>
<p><strong>annnouncer’s voice</strong>: Goat’s blood is said to hold
supernatural properties linked to black magic.</p>
<p><strong>annnouncer’s voice</strong>: In conjunction with the
pentangle- the five pointed star- the spilling of goat’s blood is
considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic
orgies, or a means by which a high priest may summon Satan himself.</p>
<p><strong>annnouncer’s voice</strong>: The Book of Revelations speaks
of the anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes. For centuries
illustrators have chosen a goat to represent this beast.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Hey. Can I borrow something?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Uh… sure, Tawny… what?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Tawny? What’s- what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m, uh, not sure… Feeling kind of weird
actually.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: I’m kinda feeling nuts myself!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’ve never said this to a woman before but
can’t we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: God. Sometimes you can be such an animal.
Other times you are the ultimate tease…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Taste this.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Wow. That’s good. Lots of capers, huh?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: For starters. It’s also got fennel,
asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature’s aphrodisiacs… Back in
college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Not a very appetizing name.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Have some more.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm
room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You must have been very proud of
yourselves…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: It’s getting hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Jesus… who did that to you?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: You’re kidding right?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: You did! God, you are funny tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Almost like I’m with somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Tawny I think I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Well now there’s a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Sorry about that. There was a blockage in
your oxygen hose. Won’t happen again, promise.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m certainly keeping you busy huh?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Too bad I hate my job…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Feeling better now?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: These hallucinations I’m having. I think
they’re more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well that’s not necessarily a bad thing is
it?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: If they’re blocked memories… I’m starting to
realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really…
screwed everything up.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Shh. Don’t blame yourself Trevor.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I miss her. I miss my wife.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: If you need to cry, go ahead. I won’t
tell.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s voice</strong>: This is Lange. We need to talk as
soon as possible. It’s about your little… dilemma. Give me a call.</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Tawny… I- you’re-</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I… think we need to talk, there’s something
really strange going on…</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Hey you’re the guy from down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it’s
about… what we did together last night.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: It’s that guy from down the hall. He thinks
we did something with him last night.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Who’s- who’s in there with you…?</p>
<p><strong>tawny</strong>: Are you cracking up or something?</p>
<p><strong>brute</strong>: What can we do for you, chief?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I… who are you?</p>
<p><strong>brute</strong>: You know Tawny, you better know me, pal.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Okay. I don’t want any trouble. I was
mistaken… I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>brute</strong>: Much.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: City police main switchboard how may I
direct your call?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You already asked me that ten minutes ago
just before you put me on hold. I’m looking for defective- I mean
Detective Lange.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Oh he and his partner just stepped out to
lunch, can I-?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Just open the doors I’ll jump off.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: Not while the bus is moving, sir.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where’s my wife Detective Lange? What the
hell did you do with her?!</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Mr. Gooding I assure you we are doing
everything within our-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Why did you leave me that message?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Basically they know where your wife’s body is
and they’re not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess? Yet
neither of them has come out and told you that you’re a suspect. Is that
what you’re trying to say?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Look Larry I know you never thought too much
of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: A little? Try unbelievably.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I swear these guys are like playing
mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work
too.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of
your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when
foul play is suspected.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hey ninety five point three percent of all
murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close
friend that’s common knowledge. But this wasn’t murder it was an
accident-</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it
hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim’s remains
hidden simply to get someone to confess. It’s absolutely preposterous.
Now I’m not saying I don’t believe you, I’m….ambiguous. There’s quite
alot of money behind all this.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is
presumed dead?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Rosie can you bring in the Gooding
papers?</p>
<p><strong>assistant’s voice</strong>: Right away Mr. Ellis.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Uh. Ballpark would be fine Larry.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: In the vicinity of eight million four hundred
fifty thousand. Or is it sixty-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What happens if I’m convicted of Kirsty’s
murder?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Well they’d have to prove it in a court of
law for one thing-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor
me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I’m
the executive of the will, Kirsty’s entire estate would have to be
donated to the city.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hello? City? Cops? It’s a fucking
conspiracy!</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like
a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the
psychiatric type. You’re obviously on the verge of some nervous
collapse.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you
too.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I never thought your late wife was the
sharpest knife in the drawer. But marrying you was the dumbest thing she
ever did!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You can go. I’m going to be here a
while.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Jesus I wish you would stop doing that.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well Trevor? What have you got to say for
yourself? Que pasa?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison we have GOT to talk about this
medication you’ve got me on.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I’m all over it.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Blink.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Okay. What we’re going to do is up the
Topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these
hallucinatory seizures you’ve been having. The extra Topomax won’t
interfere with the painkillers either but… You’re going to be thrilled
to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the
memory somewhat…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Really? Does it affect the memory?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You’re one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding.
You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right
back out into the ring for another round.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Some call it resilience. Others,
stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Everything okay Allison?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Of course, yes.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: The way you just looked at me…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I know, my bedside manner’s horrendous.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: So, I’m done. Thats it for today?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: All finished.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Think about it. In the entire world where’s
the most life-threatening place you could possibly be at any given
moment.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I don’t know… Beirut? New Orleans?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hint. It’s not a geographical location.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I’m stumped.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It’s inside a moving car.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Bull…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’ve got numbers to back me up. Over the
course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during
the entire span of World War II.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Okay so… what’s the safest place?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Statistically speaking? Inside a moving
bus.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Millions of people around the world get on
busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere
dying on a public transit bus?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Okay Mr. Statistics I’ve got one for you.
What’s the most common cause of death for adults over the age of
eighteen?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Please. Heart attack. That was easy
street.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Second most common?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Skin cancer.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Eighty third most common.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Pitbull attacks.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You just made that up.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Like you’re gonna check.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Where you two happy together?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: We startred off to be. She was, I guess I
was. I just sort of….butchered up the relationship somehow. Bad choice
of words.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I understand, I think. Other women?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yeah. It’s like I was a different guy then I
am today. I can’t remember that guy. I see these women, they think I’m
someone else, and I’m not that guy anymore. I’m not sure who Kristy
knew.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You were unfaithful, it sounds like your
confessing.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I did more then that.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Com’on. How bout some fresh air?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Lucky for us these chairs happened to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is
where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Don’t tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No. She just would have loved it up here…
Allison when I was under… did I ever talk?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Sure plenty of times.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Was there anything I said that made you stop
and wonder, you know, “where did that come from?”</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Sure plenty of times.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep
state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is
going to sound strange.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Did I ever talk about the accident?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Did I ever talk about Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: No. But at one point you did repeat
something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring
dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You said, “Jealousy arouses a husbands
fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.” Does that mean
anything to you Trevor?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It means I have alot more questions.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Times up for today. I’ve got to get
back.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: If it makes you feel better that took every
ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I understand… I won’t-</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: No you don’t understand. That’s why I’ve
been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn’t be a patient
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I would have
switched doctors!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Just get better okay?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I have to get back to work. And so do
you.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Don’t say a word, Bret.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Guess I’ll leave you two alone.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Nice chatting with ya.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Sorry I’m in your seat aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No please make yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: How’s everything, Mr. Gooding?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Can’t we dispense with the games for
once?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: I thought you loved games.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’ll just stay out of this conversation
until you come out and tell me why you’ve disrupted me at work.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: You and your wife were playing a game shortly
before you got into that car accident weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where is she? Where is my wife?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: We found this curious little object not too
far from the site of the accident. No prints but forensics scraped a
little dark residue that was caked on one of the corners. It was blood
Trevor. Matched some blood we took off your car seat too. Can you tell
me anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It looks familiar. I think it was in the
car…</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Gee you think so?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor.
Don’t work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of
pressing charges.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives
down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to
chill out and smoke a joint. I’d look the other way as long as she did
you know?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: We’re all here for you Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>recording</strong>: We’re sorry the number you have has
either been disconnected or no longer in service. If you feel you have
reached this recording in error-</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Frogurt guy’s here. They’re all out chocolate
vanilla swirl or I’d have gotten you one.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’m sure you would have.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Hey if you’re not doing anything I’d like to
buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s the occasion?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: I quit. Today’s my last day.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: I’ve got a better offer. More time off. A sort
of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: How much time off?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: As much as he feels like. Its a much more
pleasurable line of work.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: As much as he likes?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Yahtzee. Were all in this together Trev.
Trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we’re doing but they
don’t need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have some tight assed
supervisor breathing down their necks. Its all about the pleasure
Trevor!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: So you’re just packing it up just like
that?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to
tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I’ve always wanted
to go to take a trip. We’re just gonna walk into the airport and decide
right then and there.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yeah? You and who else?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Someone special.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Okay pull over.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But… I thought…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kristy noooo!</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: There is no reprieve for you. Not even in
her. She’s only a vision I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Yes I’m trying to reach one of your interns…
Allison Dormere…? She works in the emergency room there… What do you
mean…? I just saw her today… Yes I’m sure she works there I’ve been in
and out of that place five times in the last month…! Well good day to
you too asshole!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No such listing…? Could you at least tell me
IF she has an unlisted number…? What do you mean there are no Dormeres
at all there have to be…! WELL LOOK AGAIN! H-hello?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>wimpering voice</strong>: Goodbye…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>wimpering voice</strong>: You miserable sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>sage’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Sage it’s me Trevor. You’ve got to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: The feeling is very distinct. It’s like
somebody stuck a shard of glass through my eye and it’s embedded halfway
into my brain.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Trevor your body has been completely healed.
All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in
your head it’s… in your head.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Jeez it’s getting awful crowded in
there.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: You are physically better. It’s your soul that
still hurts.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: My teacher told me once there’s a puncture
point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you’re
dead. So that when you die you’re trapped inside your body, watching it
corrode for all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you,
forget. You’ve got to get this fuckin pain to stop.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up
inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You’ve blocked it from the
healing process. That’s what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to
do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or
doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It’s about trust. Do you
trust me implicitly?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I don’t even know what’s real and what isn’t
how can I trust anyone?</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you
need to move past that. And the only way to move past something
completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender
yourself to your wife’s death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out
on the other side. It’s the only way you can become whole again.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I surrender…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Wait… what the hell is this…</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Surrender yourself… surrender yourself…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kirsty… Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: It’s okay it was just a nightmare that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You’re alive…</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Yes. Now go back to sleep. You’re driving
the rest of the way to gramma’s remember?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Trevor I’ve decided we have got to agree on
a name before we reach my mother’s. This poor kid’s going to be starting
preschool as student x if we don’t make up our minds. So, I’ve been
thinking, what about Daisy?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: It’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Well that was easy all of a sudden.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Kirsty… I’m glad you’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>the siren from an approaching ambulance gets louder
and</strong>: LOUDER, piercing Trevor’s ears.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Can you hear me? Just nod.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Do you know where you are?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: We’re just gonna take some blood
here.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: You know what day it is?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Okay how many fingers am I holding
up?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Can you follow them?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Perfect. Hey you remember what happened
back there?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: You mean… when the car went off the
bridge?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Wow you are out of it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PARAMEDIC</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No… maybe… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: It’s cool. Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Hello I’m Dr…</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Ambrose. I know.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Have we met?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I’ve been in here before.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Take no offense Trevor. I see many
patients a day and have an awful memory.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Join the club.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Right. Trevor you just had a seizure
brought on by a severe migraine. Things could be much worse. In the next
few days you need to take plenty of aspirin, stay out of the sun and
make sure you’ve had at least eight glasses of water by the time you go
to bed at night.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Why don’t you relax for the next couple
of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after
that.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where’s Allison?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Who’s Allison?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison Dormere. Your intern.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Uh we have no intern by that name here
Mr. Gooding. Listen I’ll be back in a few hours to check up on you
meantime relax try not to move around too much.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: There there Trevor. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: If you need anything give myself or any of
the nurses a call okay? We’re-</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Don’t tell me. �We’re all here for you
Trevor’ right? Go ahead say it! You know you want to!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What the hell are you talking about…?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Trevor! Mr. Gooding lay back down-</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Okay ya caught me.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff
left.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I don’t work here.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Music to my ears.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Trevor. I heard you were looking for me. Is
everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison! Am I glad to see you! No…
everything’s not right. Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Allison I think I did some very, very bad
things. I mean very bad.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Trevor things like this happen to people
who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret.
You just couldn’t remember doing these things and now you are so it’s a
shock to the system. I’m telling you. You will never get better if you
keep blaming yourself for your wife’s death.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Maybe I wasn’t responsible for the car
accident…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hey buddy!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: … but I’m starting to think I was… I was
going to…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hey buddy!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What do you want?!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Who the hell are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: This is it mister.</p>
<p><strong>bus driver</strong>: Have a good night now.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I don’t know what I’m doing here. I’m not
even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It’s like, ever since my
wife died I don’t know what I’ve actually done or what I’ve imagined.
But I do know if one tenth of what’s happening to me is reality… I’ve
done some really awful things in my life. Things that I’ve… I guess I’ve
blocked out…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What things do you think you’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Wow. Let’s see. So many sins so little time.
For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was
carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million
dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex
with behind her back.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TREVOR</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Trevor I’m sure you killed no one. You are
very distraught over your wife’s death and rightfully so. You did the
right thing by confessing to me here tonight. And you should keep
praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease. That being said,
you are still in a highly emotional state right now. It might do you
some good to get some professional help. Confess to them the way you
confessed to me. In time you’ll probably find that the real killer has
already been caught. Or better yet… that these murders never happened at
all.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated
bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: All you’ve got is the here and the now
Trevor. That’s all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier
to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream
that he’s a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually
be a butterfly who dreams he’s a man. And at the end of the day does it
even matter? All these events you’re describing. How can you be sure any
of them really happened?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: But that’s what I need. To be sure… to be
absolutely sure…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Shh. It’s okay son. There is but one truth.
One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Still in the dark I see?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Poor Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: This game is over do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: I hear everything. And soon you will know
everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want
you to think for a minute first. Think about all you’ve seen. All the
clues you’ve been given.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Bret… what the fuck…?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor.
Remember? I couldn’t believe you went through five dart games and didn’t
even joke about it.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Bret. What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: We were gonna be millionaires you said.
Nobody’d suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then
you went and had that fucking car accident.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life.
And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee
shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o’clock news, five wait for
Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o’clock get ready
for bed.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: BRET</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: Then I find out you’re having nooners with my
GWEN. That was all I could take. I didn’t want to kill your wife
anymore. I wanted to kill you. Even before that little accident I
decided to do it on the day we’d set aside for her.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: But now that ain’t gonna happen either. I fell
in love with Kirsty Trevor. The day she died it was like my soul had
been ripped from my body. Not just because I lost someone I loved. It’s
because the child inside her… was mine.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Okay Trevor. Put the knife down.</p>
<p><strong>cop#1</strong>: Full name?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Trevor Alan Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>cop#1</strong>: Age?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Thirty one.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TREVOR</p>
<p><strong>inside the doorway</strong>: TWO DETECTIVES have some HAPLESS
SOUL strapped to some odd looking electrical contraption.</p>
<p><strong>hapless soul</strong>: I told you I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>detective#1</strong>: Wrong answer!</p>
<p><strong>cop#1</strong>: Single file.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We’re all here for you Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>lange’s voice</strong>: Stop and face the mirror!</p>
<p><strong>lange’s voice</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>brute</strong>: I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>cop#1</strong>: Got quite a fan club don’t you, hotshot?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: For the last time. I honestly don’t know how
any of them died…</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: Now I want you to tell me what you remember
happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange.
But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I did it. I killed them all. I confess.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Quick detour through the morgue boys.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Morgue…?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: That’s right Trevor. The timing was
impeccable wasn’t it? It’s been eight months two weeks and three days
but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: Where was it?</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: That’s the weird part. It just magically
turned up in the river less than thirty yards from where the car had
landed. Like somebody put it there while we weren’t looking.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Just keep walking Trevor. You can’t miss
it.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: How is our little student doing? Has he
learned his lesson yet?</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: I don’t know who you are or what you want. I
just want to know what’s under that sheet…</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Use your mind for something other than
numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than
yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife’s back. You
were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident
your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have
known she would find out.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Jealousy arouses a spouse’s fury. And no
mercy will be shown when that revenge is given.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must
have wondered: What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind
YOUR back?</p>
<p><strong>low angle up at</strong>: Kirsty, Trevor’s lovely wife,
raising a rock above her.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: What’s under that sheet…?</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: You probably don’t remember the night we
played. Your first year as husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: It must have seemed like we were uninvited
guests crashing your little celebration.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: But someone was expecting us Trevor. And
everything went according to plan.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: We were about to come for Kirsty. When we
were offered a deal. We don’t usually consider bargains but this one was
too good to pass up. A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent
hellbent on protecting its spawn. The deal we were offered was this:
three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside
Kirsty. The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we
were very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Two of your favorite companions, most
supple and delicious as you already know. And the man you had at one
time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with
child.</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: They were all real screamers too. We had a
blast. And there was one more. You’ve seen many things you wished you
hadn’t. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues
in our little puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth
soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement?</p>
<p><strong>pinhead</strong>: Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all,
Trevor. Reality.</p>
<p><strong>trevor</strong>: No… no…</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Open this and your problem will disappear
forever. And no one will ever suspect you.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Shhh it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty’s voice</strong>: Yes. Yes that’s him.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Well I guess that’s it then. Thank you
Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have been tough.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Alrighty. Let’s get started folks.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Collecting 40ccs of serum…</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Examining cranial fracture…</p>
<p><strong>trevor’s pov</strong>: Ambrose closing the eyelid again.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Checking oral cavity for blockage…</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: And we have a winner…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Looks like an eel of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: Guess it was murder after all.</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: Yeah all we need is the eel’s motive.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: I still don’t get it. He’s been missing for
almost eight months. But this body hasn’t been dead more than twenty
four hours.</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Makes you wonder what he was up to
between the time he disappeared and when he died.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?</p>
<p><strong>dr. ambrose</strong>: Allison what on earth possesses you to
converse with cadavers?</p>
<p><strong>sage</strong>: It’s simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there is no
afterlife? What happens when we die? Do we just stay stuck inside your
bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: I’m not following this…</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well if that’s the case… wouldn’t you want
someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time?</p>
<p><strong>ambrose</strong>: You two are creeping me out. And I’m a
coroner.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: Allison slipping a tag on Trevor’s toe;
sliding Trevor’s body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the lock
on the drawer.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Adios amigo.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: I would have come in sooner but I had an
important errand to run last night. Out of town. Figures you’d find his
body the minute I decide to go off somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Well you made it down here that’s the
important part. Thank you for your patience Mrs. Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: One last thing… When they found him he was
holding something. Not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: Figured you might want it.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Of course. That was my… last anniversary
present to him.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: A token to remember him by now. Goodbye
Mrs. Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Thank you detective.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Looking for someone, Kirsty?</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: You bet I was.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Okay we’re on our way. Remember her-</p>
<p><strong>nanny</strong>: Lactose intolerance. I’ve stocked the fridge
with Lactaid.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: See you in a couple of weeks. You’ve got my
cell number right?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Daisy is getting so big. I still can’t
believe HE was her father.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore.
Can we just start spending HIS money instead.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I’ve always wanted to go to Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: You mean the place with bats?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: They’re called flying lemurs.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Yeah that sounds like a real blast…</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: You forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lange</strong>: No Mrs. Gooding.</p>
<p><strong>givens</strong>: Thank YOU.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: After you my dear.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Airport please.</p>
<p><strong>kirsty</strong>: Time, Larry. Time’s up.</p>
