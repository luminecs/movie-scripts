<h1 id="halloween">halloween</h1>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: My parents won’t be back till ten.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: We’re all alone, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Michael’s around someplace…</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Take off that thing.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Will you call me tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: …then he gets another physical by the state,
and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four
hours if we’re lucky, then we’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What did you use before?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Thorazin.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: He’ll barely be able to sit up.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: That’s the idea. Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: The driveway’s a few hundred yards up on
your right.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Are there any special instructions?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Just try to understand what we’re dealing
with here. Don’t underestimate it.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I think we should refer to ‘it’ as
‘him.’</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Ever done anything like this before?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Only minimum security.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: It means… I see.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You don’t have to make this harder than it
already is.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I couldn’t if I tried.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The only thin that ever bothers me is their
jibberish. When they start raving on and on…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: You don’t have anything to worry about. He
hasn’t spoken a word in 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Since when do they let them wander
around?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Pull up to the entrance!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Shouldn’t we pick him up?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Move it!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He asked me if I could help him find his
purple lawnmower.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I don’t think this is any time to be
funny…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He said something else. “It’s all right now.
He’s gone. The evil’s gone.”</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Something fell on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Something JUMPED on the roof…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: You can calm down. The evil’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t forget to drop off the keys at the
Myers place…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: They’re coming by to see the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, Laurie…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hi, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Are you coming over tonight?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Same time, same place.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can we watch the monster movies?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Sure. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re not supposed to go in there.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Uh-uh. That’s a spook house.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Just watch.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie
Elam said that’s a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened
there once.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Lonnie Elam probably won’t get out of the
sixth grade.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I gotta go. I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I wish I had you all alone… Just the two of
us… I would hold you close to me… So close to me…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Just the two of us… So close to me…</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: I’m not responsible, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: I’ve given them his profile.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: You must have told them we shocked him into
a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn’t
stop a five-year-old!</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: He was your patient, Doctor. If the
precautions weren’t sufficient, you should have notified…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I notified everybody! Nobody listened.</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: There’s nothing else I can do.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: You can get back on the telephone and tell
them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where
he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: PROBABLY going.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I’m wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>wynn</strong>: Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles
from here. How could he get there? He can’t drive.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He was doing all right last night. Maybe
somebody around here gave him lessons.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: …and the book ends, but what Samuels is
really talking about here is fate.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: You see, fate caught up with several lives
here. No matter what course of action Rollins took, he was destined to
his own fate, his own day of reckoning with himself. The idea is that
destiny is a very real, concrete thing that every person has to deal
with.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Edwin, how does Samuels’ view of fate
differ from that of Costaine?</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: Uh… doesn’t he feel that no matter how
complicated something is, it’s also really simple, too?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: No. Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: M’am?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related
only to religion, where Samuels felt that fate was like a natural
element, like earth, air, fire, and water.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: That’s right, Samuels definitely
personified fate…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: No, not since Thursday. Yes, yes, I’m all
right… Stop worrying. After this I’ll sleep for a week, two weeks… I
said I’m all right… Believe me. I’ll be home soon. Yes, I do. Very much.
I just…have to stop him. Of course it’s possible, but I know him. And
when he gets there, God help us. Right, right, I’ll call you. Me too.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: He’s gonna get you!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: He’s gonna get you, he’s gonna get you…</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: The boogeyman is coming!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No, he’s not. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: He doesn’t believe us. Don’t you know what
happens on Halloween?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah, we get candy.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Oooooo! The boogey man!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey
man…</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: It’s totally insane! We have three new cheers
to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done
at five, and the dance is at eight. I’ll be totally wiped out!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I think you have too much to do
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: TOTALLY!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: As usual, I don’t have anything to do.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: It’s your own fault and I don’t feel sorry
for you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, Lynda, Laurie!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why didn’t you wait for me?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never
showed up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s not true. Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What’s wrong, Annie? You’re not smiling.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m never smiling again. Paul dragged me into
the boys’ locker room to tell me…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Exploring uncharted territory?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: It’s been totally charted.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We just talked.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and
soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can’t come
over tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I thought you were babysitting tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: The only reason she babysits is to have a
place to…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have a place for that.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I forgot my chemistry book.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Who cares? I ALWAYS forget my chemistry
book.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Isn’t that David Graham? He’s cute.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Speed kills!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Can’t you take a joke?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie, some day you’re going to get us all
in deep trouble.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I hate a guy with a car and no sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Well, are we still on for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I wouldn’t want to get you in deep trouble,
Lynda.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning
on it all week.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’M baby sitting for the Doyles. It’s only
three houses away. We can keep each other company.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Terrific. I’ve got three choices. Watch the
kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What time?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: I don’t know yet. I have to get out of taking
my stupid brother trick-or- treating.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Saving the treats for Bob?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Fun-ny. See you.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Look where?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Behind that bush there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: That man who drove by so fast, the one you
yelled at.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Subtle, isn’t he? Hey creep!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Laurie, my dear, he want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He wants to take you out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: He was standing right here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s tragic. You never go out. You must have
a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: The guys think I’m too smart.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t. I think you’re whacko. You’re seeing
men behind bushes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, home sweet home. I’ll see you
later.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: I’m sorry, Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Mister Brackett…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Well, it’s Halloween. I guess everybody’s
entitled to a good scare.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yes, sir. Nice seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew
superstition.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hi, Mom, I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>laurie’s mother</strong>: Laurie, Annie just called. She said
call her back.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Thanks, mom.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why did you hang up on me?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie, was that you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Why didn’t you say anything? You scared me
to death.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I had my mouth full. Couldn’t you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I thought it was an obscene phone call.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Now you hear obscene chewing. You’re losing
it, Laurie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’ve already lost it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me
use her car. I’ll pick you up. 6:30.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Sure, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Calm down. This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let’s see. Myers. Judith Myers. Row 18, plot
20. Over this way.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Every town has something like this happen. I
remember a guy over in Russellville. Charly Bowles. About fifteen year
ago, he finished dinner, excused himself from the table, went out into
the garage and got a hack saw, then came back into the house, kissed his
wife and two children goodbye, and then proceeded to…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Just right over there a ways. And I remember
Judith Myers. Just couldn’t believe it. A young boy like that…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Lost?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why do they do it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Goddamn kids. They’ll do anything on
Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Whose grave is it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: 18, 20… Judith Myers…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He came home…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We just have time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You still spooked?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I wasn’t spooked.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lies.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle’s back
yard.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Probably Mister Riddle.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: He was watching me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie,
Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: He can still watch.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s probably all he can do.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s the pumpkin for?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a
Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I always said you’d make a fabulous girl
scout.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: For that matter, I might as well be a girl
scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia.
Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won’t know
what hit her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My dad!</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Hi, Annie, Laurie…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi, Dad. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Someone broke into the hardware store.
Probably kids.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You blame everything on kids.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: The only things missing were some
Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to
you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s hard growing up with a cynical
father.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: You’re going to be late at the Doyles,
Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: You’re going to be late!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He shouts, too.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Goodbye, girls.</p>
<p><strong>annie and laurie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Sheriff? I’m Doctor Sam Loomis.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Lee Brackett.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I’d like to talk to you, if I could.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around
here…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Anybody live here?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Not since 1963, since it happened. Every
kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: They may be right.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: A dog…</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Still warm.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He got hungry.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Come on… A skunk could have killed it…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Could have…</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: A man wouldn’t do that…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He isn’t a man.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: It happened in here.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: She was sitting here when he came through
the door.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He must have watched them through this
window…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Standing just outside, he could peer over
the sill…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Looks like to me you’re just plain
scared.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I am. I met him fifteen years ago. I was
told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding,
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong.
I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the
blackest of eyes, the Devil’s eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach
him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized
what was living behind that boy’s eyes was purely and simply… evil.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be
coming back. I’m going to wait for him.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: I keep thinking I should call the radio
and TV stations…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: If you do they’ll be seeing him everywhere,
on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their
mouths and open their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: I’ll check back in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: …“how now, cried Arthur. ‘Then no one may
pass this way without a fight?’ ‘That is so,’ answered the night in a
bold and haughty manner…”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t like that story.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: But king Arthur was always your

<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Not any more.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Why are they under there?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mom doesn’t like me to have them.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: ‘Neutron Man’… ‘Laser Man’… I can see why.
‘Tarantula Man’…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Laurie, what’s the Boogey Man?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Having fun? Never mind, I’m sure you are. I
have big, big news for you…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oops! Hold on a minute…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi Lester…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, Lindsey! I’m about to be ripped
apart by the family dog.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Get him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Here, Lester.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I hate that dog. I’m the only person in the
world he doesn’t like.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What’s this big, big news?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What would you say if I told you that you
were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’d say you must have the wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he
got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie, you didn’t. Tell me you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You guys will make a fabulous couple.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Laurie…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m so embarrassed. I couldn’t face him…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’ll have to. He’s calling you tomorrow to
find out what time to pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Laurie, the boogey man is outside. Look!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hold on. There’s nobody out there, Tommy. Go
watch some TV.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Look, it’s simple. You like him, he likes
you. All you need is a little push.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It won’t hurt you to go out with him, for
God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Shit! No, no, I gotta call you back. I just
made a mess of myself. Nothing unusual.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, Lester’s barking again and getting
on my nerves again.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Never mind. He found a hot date.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What about the Jack-O-Lantern?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: After the movie.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What about the rest of my comic books?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: After the Jack-O-Lantern.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What about the bogyman?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: There is no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Richie said he was coming after me
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Do you believe everything that Richie tells
you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy, Halloween night is when you play
tricks on people and scare them. It’s all make believe.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: There was no one outside.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There WAS.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The bogyman!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: We’re no getting anywhere. All right, look,
Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: And I’m here tonight and I won’t let him get
to you.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Terrific!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Paul, is this one of your cheap tricks? I
guess not.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No tricks for Annie tonight.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey! Lindsey, come out here!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, I’m in the laundry room! The door is
stuck!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey! Lindsey, goddamn it, help!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, answer the phone! It’s Paul!
Lindsey! LINDSEY!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Yes, she is.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will you get her for me?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: She’s washing her clothes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, go tell her it’s me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Annie, Paul’s on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, open the door! I’m locked in the
laundry room!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You locked yourself in.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know. Pull my legs. I’m stuck.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lindsey, promise you won’t tell anyone!</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: She was stuck in the window, she’ll be
right there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello, Paul. All right, cut it out. It can
happen to anyone. Yeah, but I’ve seen you stuck in OTHER POSITIONS!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s fantastic! When did they leave?
Utterly fabulous! So why don’t you just walk over? My clothes are in the
wash. I can’t come now. Shut up, jerk. I’ve got a robe on. That’s all
you think about. That’s not true. I think about lots of things. Why
don’t we not stand here talking about them and get down to doing them?
All right, see you in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Then why are you sitting here with half the
lights off?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, come on, get your coat. We’re going to
pick up Paul.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each
other…</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I want to stay here and watch this.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hi, come on in. We’re making a Jack-
O-Lantern.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I want to watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Fancy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: This has not been my night. My clothes are in
the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a
window…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’m glad you’re here because I have
something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell
him you were just fooling around.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey
and he won’t be back until late. YOU’LL have to call him tomorrow.
Besides, I’m on my way to pick up Paul.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Wait a minute here…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: If you watch her, I’ll CONSIDER talking to
Ben Tramer in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.
Listen, I’ll call you in an hour or so.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: The old girl scout comes through again.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Paul, I give you all…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No keys, but please… my Paul.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My Paul, I can no longer stall…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Lucky thing. Spilled butter on her clothes,
but nobody will know… …except for Paul…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hello. Oh, hi, Dad. No, just watching TV with
lindsey. Be careful about what? Well, if you won’t tell me how can I be
careful? Sure, sure I will. Bye, dad.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Lindsey. Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There he is, there he is! The bogyman!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I saw him again! He’s over at Lindsey’s
house. The bogyman!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy, stop it! You’re scaring Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I saw him…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I said, stop it! There is no bogyman.
There’s nothing out there. If you don’t stop all this, I’m turning off
the TV and you go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nobody believes me.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I believe you, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: I’m not afraid.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Then go in.</p>
<p><strong>richie</strong>: Chicken!</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: Go on, Lonnie!</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Lonnie…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Get your ass away from there!</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Nothing’s going on. Just kids playing
pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high… I have the feeling
you’re way off on this…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: You have the wrong feeling.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: You’re not coming up with much to prove me
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Exactly what do you need?</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Well, it’s going to take more than fancy
talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in
a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing
THIS NIGHT. He’s waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day
after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him.
Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or
you can help me stop it.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: More fancy talk… You want to know what
Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down
these streets. You’re telling me they’re lined up for a
slaughterhouse.</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: They could be.</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: I’ll stay out with you tonight, Doctor,
just on the chance that you’re right. And if you are right, damn you for
letting him out.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Now… First we’ll talk a little, then Annie
will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first
bedroom on the left. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Okay. First I rip your clothes off…</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: You idiot!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: …Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip
LYNDSEY’S clothes off. I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Totally…</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Bob… Put me down. Put me down. This is
totally silly.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Annie, Annie, we’re here!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I wonder where they went.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.
Let’s look for a note.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Let’s don’t.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Ooooooo… He’s gonna get you.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: No, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Nobody’s going to get anybody. Now stop
scaring each other.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay,
kids, what do you want to do now?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: Let’s make more popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’ve had enough. Why don’t we just sit
down and watch the rest of this movie.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Hi, Laurie, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Nothing. I was just sitting down for the
first time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Is Annie around?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No. I thought she’d be home by now. She went
to pick up Paul.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Well, she’s totally not here.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: They probably stopped off somewhere. Have
her call me when she gets back. I’ve got Lyndsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Okay. Later.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: We sure will.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Lindsey is gone for the night.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Now that’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Shit! Not again.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I can’t help it. It just keeps ringing.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: And I can’t keep you interested?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: That’s great. Now you’ll be too drunk to…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Just answer the damn phone.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: I can’t. What if it’s the Wallaces!? We’d get
Annie in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Take it off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Fantastic. Totally.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Is that all you say?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Go get me a beer.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I thought you were gonna get one for me.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: YEAH?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’ll be right back. Don’t get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Annie, Paul…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lynda, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Alright, Lynda, come on out.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Where’s my beer?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Cute, Bob. Real cute.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Come here, you fool.</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Can’t I get your ghost, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: All right, all right. So where’s the
beer?</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Well, answer me! Okay, don’t answer me. Boy,
are you weird!</p>
<p><strong>lynda</strong>: Well, I’m gonna call Laurie. I wanna know
where Annie and Paul are. THIS isn’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: All right, Annie! I’ve heard your famous
chewing, now I get your famous squeals?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie, Annie! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Are you fooling around again?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I’ll kill you if this is a joke!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Annie?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Bob, Lynda, Annie?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: All right, meatheads. The joke is over.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Come on, Annie, enough.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: This has most definitely stopped being
funny. Now cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: You’ll be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly we are aware of something there in the dark
corner.</strong>: It is almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to
adjust to the darkness and we see THE OUTLINE OF A MAN standing right
behind her.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Help me! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Please, help me! Call the police!
Please!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No! No! Please, open the door!</p>
<p><strong>the shape walks slowly down the middle of the street,
right</strong>: TOWARD HER!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy! Tommy, open the door!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy, let me in!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What is it, Laurie?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the
bedroom and lock the door!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m scared…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s the bogyman, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: HURRY!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Please stop… Please…</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Where were you? I went back to the Myers
house…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: I found the car! He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>brackett</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up
that other street and then back down here. I’m going up the block.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It’s all right now. Shhh, it’s all
right…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Now I want you to change your clothes,
Tommy. We’re going to take a walk outside.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Was it the bogyman?</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: I’m scared!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: There’s nothing to be scared of now. Get
changed.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: I killed him…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: But you can’t kill the bogyman.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Lock the door! Lock the door!</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Tommy, it’s me. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Now, I want you to walk to the door, down
the stairs and right out the front door.</p>
<p><strong>lindsey</strong>: You’re coming with us…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Listen to me. I want you to walk down the
street to the MacKensie’s and knock on their door. You tell them to call
the police and send them over here. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Laurie, you come with us…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: No! Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: Well, kiddo. Some Halloween…</p>
<p><strong>laurie</strong>: It WAS the bogyman…</p>
<p><strong>loomis</strong>: As a matter of fact it was.</p>
