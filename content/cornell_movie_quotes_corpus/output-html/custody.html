<p><strong>rick</strong>: Helluva talent, that kid.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Probably be in the bigs in another year.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Zach? Are you ready? Mommy, can’t be late
again.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Come on baby. Don’t do this to mommy. Not
today.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I don’t want to go. Melanie hastily dresses
her son.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Zach, do you want mommy to get fired?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: If I get fired we won’t have the money to
go to Six Flags. Zach quickly dresses himself.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Must be something to have that kind of talent.
He’s just a kid, nineteen, twenty tops, and if he stays healthy and he
stays focused, the world is his oyster. Guys like you and me, we
squandered those opportunities long ago.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Guys like you…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And me…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … squandered opportunities. I, on the other
hand, knew where I was going. I had that kind of drive, I just never had
the talent.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You knew where you were going?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: At nineteen?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Without question.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: The only thing I knew for certain was that I
would run to the corner store every day for beer.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Lock your door. I’ll be right back. Melanie
opens her door.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m not thirteen. It’s against the law to
leave me alone in a car until I’m thirteen.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had priorities. I understood what it meant
to have an attention span.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You could focus?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was the King of Focus.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: The Duke of Diligence?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The Count of Concentration.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Duck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: The Polestar Prince.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Did you decide?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I want Coke.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Get one.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: No, Pepsi. No, Seven-Up. Maybe root beer.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Make up your mind already.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: So many choices. A glance to her watch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m just saying grow up. You can’t keep
drifting.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought I did grow up…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When you got married?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You matured a little.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s a process.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No Bueller, it’s a decision. One you need to
make. You can’t keep running without direction. If you don’t know where
you’re going you’ll never get what you want.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I want Sobe.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I don’t want Coke. I want Sobe.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We’ll take the soda.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Two dollars and…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Hold on a minute. Please?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Come on lady.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Get your Sobe.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought I got direction…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When Cindy had kids?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They gave you purpose. But purpose, my friend,
is not direction.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: East.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My direction is east. I parked in the
deck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m right around the…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Corner?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’re always going in different
directions.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mine are much more productive.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And much less adventurous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Then go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s what I’m going to do. Responsibility
calls.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sobe sucks. I want Coke.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want to…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Get a beer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Can’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Gotta get home.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Family, my man. Take time off for a ballgame
ya should probably tend to the family too. You should try it
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In the grand scheme of things family is a
liability, not an asset. Rick continues on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you even know what you’re doing or where
you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: East.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: East leads nowhere, my friend. You should be
heading south. The bar is south. East takes you places you don’t want to
go.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I know, but…</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: No buts. You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: It’s the third time this week Mel. You put me
in a rough spot here. My boss wants me to let you go. His boss wants me
to let you go. I gotta let you go.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: If a person isn’t responsible enough to be
prompt to their job, they’re not responsible enough to work for me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You’re fired Mel. Just get your things and
go.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: We still on for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Is that…?</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: You think…?</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Naw…</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Can’t tell from here…</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Too far away. Let’s roost him.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Call it in.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: It’s him… get him, get him, get him.
They curb the car in front of Rick.</p>
<p><strong>ext. akron’s buchtel ave - day</strong>: Rick appears
dumbfounded as the officers exit the cruiser with guns drawn. Officer
One remains stationary. Officer Two circles behind Rick.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Get em up. Up I said… up.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Get <code>em where we can see</code>em
slimeball.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug
here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What’s going…</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Shaddup!</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: You know your rights, cretin, but just
in case you don’t…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What the hell? Officer Two spins Rick to face
him.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: You have the right to shut the hell up.
Do you understand this right?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: If you don’t shut the hell up my
partner might exercise his right to shoot you. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: He’s looking at me funny, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: You have the right not to look at my
partner in any way that might be construed as `funny’ which could result
in harm to your person. Do you understand this right?</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: He twitching?</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Really? I don’t think he is. Are you
twitching boy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No Sir.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Look at him, he’s twitching. Nothing
pisses me off more than twitching and talking. If he doesn’t stop I’m
gonna waste him.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: You have the right not to twitch or
shiver or make any other odd movements that might encourage my partner
to discharge his weapon, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: You never answered about tonight.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’re making a huge mistake.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: What do we got here boys?</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: It’s him. We got him.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: He’s a twitcher… a twitcher and a
talker. Boy, I tell you, if he’d twitched one more time I would’ve
deposited large amounts of hot lead in his ass.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: I’ll take it from here boys.</p>
<p><strong>officer two</strong>: Report too?</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: No, that’s your job.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: If we have to write the report I say I
get to shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: No one’s getting shot today,
Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>officer one</strong>: Can’t I just wing him or something?</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Jimmy; get him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Tell me I’m not responsible… asshole. I
have a kid. He has a goldfish. I have my dignity.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: You don’t want to piss Bobby off.
He’s a little unstable.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: A little? He represents your force?</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Affirmative action. We have to
hire our fair share of disabled — Quota thing.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: His psychosis doesn’t appear disabling.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Where’s Zach?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nelson</strong>: Fired again?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nelson</strong>: The first thing I learned when I
retired was that time management is an asset.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Take your time, Ma’am. We need
you to be certain.</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: Can I see their profiles?</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Turn to your left. The men follow
their instruction.</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: I just… I just don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Back to front.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: All of you face forward. The two
turn forward.</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: Number three…</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: Could you have him step forward?</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Number three take two steps
forward.</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: You’re positive?</p>
<p><strong>lady in black</strong>: I’m positive. That’s the man that
needs to be in custody.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Okay number three step back. Rick
does as he’s told.</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: Turn to your right — all of
you…</p>
<p><strong>detective johnson</strong>: …and exit.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Order in the court.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Order in the court, I say.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Do you know why you’re here today,
Mr. Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Are you being rhetorical?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You stand here today an accused man.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Accused? Accused of what?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You have been placed in custody of your
children.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do
realize you have children, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you have
children or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: So, you accept responsibility for
bringing young life into the world?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I guess…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: There’s no guessing, Mr. Stevens, either
you’re responsible for siring offspring or you aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I am, but I’m not sure it was responsible.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens? How
convenient. And you accept the consequences of said actions?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why are
you here? I’ll tell you why you’re here. Are you familiar with
Ms. Cynthia Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, she’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife. She
recently filed for divorce. Were you aware of that?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, no I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Well, she did. She also named you as her
coconspirator in the act of having children. Were you aware of that,
Mr. Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Again, no.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Mr. Stevens, you just told the court
that you aware you had children. You have also admitted that Ms. Cynthia
Stevens was, in fact, your wife.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you continue
to deny culpability in this situation?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>audience</strong>: Answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: The question, Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How can you be sure it was me?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: She picked you out of a lineup, Sir.
What more do you need?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Time.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens. Time
— is not — an option.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: You don’t deny being married to
Ms. Stevens, nor do you deny the act of procreation. You seem to
understand that your actions bear consequence. You seem to understand
that with parenthood, came responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: It’s time to pay the piper, Mr. Stevens.
It is the recommendation of the State that Richard C. Stevens been
sentenced to the fullest capacity allowed by law.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What about Cindy?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: My ex, Cindy, what about her responsibilities
to the children?</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: She cut a deal, Rick. You were the one
we wanted. You were the one we got. She took the plea. Sure, it costs
her financially. But what is freedom worth?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I see no reason to extend this any further.
Mr. Stevens you have been found competent by the State and by this
Court. You are completely cognizant of your surroundings, and you leave
me no choice. This court finds you guilty as charged.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Guilty of what?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You are hereby remanded to custody of your
children for no less than a lifetime. This Court is adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can’t do this alone. Don’t make me do this
alone. I’ll never make it…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: If you can’t do the time, Mr. Stevens, then
don’t do the crime.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Highly Effective Strategies of Time
Management for the Single Parent?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nelson</strong>: Learn it. Live it.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: It was written by a man… a married man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nelson</strong>: Lots of single parents are married.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hi guys.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I love you daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I love you too, Phillip.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I love you more.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I love you more.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I love YOU more.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Daddy, how come you’re in jail?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Is this where we live?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: When can we see mommy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Come here guys. I want to talk to you. The
boys gather round.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: What’s wrong Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know when we’re going to see your mom
again.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Is she okay?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s kind of mad at daddy.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Mommy mad at me too?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, baby, not at all. Your mom needs time to
work through some things. So, for awhile, it’s just going to be us…</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: What’s she need time for?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: To figure out who she is, where she’s going,
what she wants.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I miss mommy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She misses you too, baby. And this isn’t
permanent… we’re going to fight this… we’re going to appeal. We’ll take
it to the Supreme Court if we have to.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You don’t want us either?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Of course I want you. I just don’t think I
should have to do this alone.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: I feel for you, I really do, but I’ve seen
your kind before. You’re a lifer. Whether it’s fair or not. Whether
justice was served. It doesn’t matter. You’re here for the duration.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What’s wrong mommy?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Why are you crying? Did I do something
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Nothing at all baby.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Tell me a story?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Once upon a time, a very long time ago…</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Get yourself cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: You have visitors… in the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>ext. summit county jail - courtyard - day</strong>: Shaved
and wearing sunglasses, Rick approaches his parents. He reaches his
FATHER, , first.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Quite the pickle you’ve got yourself in.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So it seems.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: She was no good for you. I knew it from the
start.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Mom, don’t… okay?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Just saying…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know, but what’s done is done.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: There’s my boys.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You’re dad and I are here for you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Are you eating?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do you need anything? Food? Money?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Watch the kids one night? I could use some
time to myself.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Um… Yeah… okay… I suppose that would be all
right… we’d have to ask your father, but I don’t see why that would be a
problem. Other than that everything’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’re okay…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Because it doesn’t have to be like this.
Mary Ryan, a friend of mine, her son had the same thing happen to him.
Wife just up and left with no warning at all. He didn’t waste a day. No
sir, he was up and at `em almost instantly. You can leave here, you
know? Mary Ryan’s son did.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I like it here, mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What’s to like? It’s dingy and filthy. It’s
no place to raise children.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s home and it’s stable. The one thing the
boys need right now is stability.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You can’t keep hiding forever.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s been five days, mom. I’m not hiding. I
just need time to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Mary Ryan’s son thinks you’re hiding.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Do I know this guy?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, but I think you should. I hate that
woman. How can a mother abandon her kids? How could she do this to my
babies?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Scott? Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah baby?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I hope she’s living in hell too.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What ya doing?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Looking for a job.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I know what you could do.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: You could stay home with me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What do you pay?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sixty-five cents.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: A day?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: A week.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You can afford that?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: If it keeps my mommy home with me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So, needless to say, I understand your
situation. My old lady, she took off and left me with the kids five
years ago. That bitch. But I’m not bitter or anything. I found me a good
day care and moved on with my life. You should too.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s hard…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Of course it’s hard, sometimes feels like
you’re in prison, but you gotta be a man… stand up for yourself… provide
for your family.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And you can help?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Me? I’ll put ya to work. Some long hours, but
it all pays off. Keeps you off the welfare system if ya know what I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d rather pay you than pay the government to
pay you. You can start Monday.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here’s the number to the day-care. Tell them
you know me, they’ll cut you a break.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: And when school starts we have a bus
service that will take the two oldest to and from school. We have story
hour at Eleven, lunch at noon, and nap time at Twelve- thirty. Rest
assured our programs are designed to be nurturing, caring environments
that provide the parental guidance your children need in those hours you
can’t be with them. So, are there any questions?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No, you seemed to cover everything. Ms. Heath
bends down to the kid’s level.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: You’re going to like it here.</p>
<p><strong>kris and phillip</strong>: No, daddy, don’t leave us
here.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: They’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>first interviewer</strong>: I’m sorry. It would be really
nice to have you on board, but you’re just a little too qualified.</p>
<p><strong>second interviewer</strong>: Too Qualified.</p>
<p><strong>third interviewer</strong>: Over qualified.</p>
<p><strong>fourth interviewer</strong>: You’re just not qualified.</p>
<p><strong>fifth interviewer</strong>: I don’t think I’ve seen such a
perfect candidate.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>provider</strong>: You are bad, bad children.</p>
<p><strong>fifth interviewer</strong>: Education level. Work experience.
You really fit the billet.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, did everything go okay?</p>
<p><strong>provider</strong>: They were angels.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Did you have fun boys?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Get those seat belts on. The kids reluctantly
comply.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, how was your day?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Didn’t they feed you? They said they would
feed you. The brochure said meals provided.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: We didn’t eat nuffin.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Daddy, I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>fifth interviewer</strong>: Unfortunately we filled the
position earlier today. WHIP PAN to cell doors slamming closed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So, how was your first week?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Thirteen hours a day doesn’t leave me much
time for my kids, But a job’s a job, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Now you’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Two hundred and fifty bucks?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pretty good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Two-hundred-and-fifty-bucks?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t spend it all in one place.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I give you sixty-five hours of my time and you
give me two hundred fifty bucks?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s the American way. This country was
founded on low paying, back breaking, long hour jobs. Why, work like
this makes you a bona fide patriot. Ya gotta love it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What’s not to love?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: That will be two hundred seventy- five
dollars and thirty-six cents.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m a little short.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: We take checks too.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Checks?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Those things you use when you don’t have
money.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m clueless. My wife handled the
checks.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Does it help that I know Frank Ryan? He told
me to mention his name.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: You know Frank?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I work for him.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: That changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Two hundred ninety-five dollars and
thirty-six cents.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Frank owes me money and one way or
another, I will collect.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, I’m forty-five dollars short…</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: And thirty-six cents. Don’t worry about
it. It’s your first week. You didn’t know, so, we’ll let it ride and
just add it to next week’s balance. A beat as Rick turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: You know there is a way you could save
quite a bit of money.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Potty train the toddler.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Potty train? Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: The toddler.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Yes, baby?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: When are we going to have a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We do have a normal life… for us.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I mean when are we going to be like other
people?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Big boy go potty.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Are you a big boy?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Huge-mong-gus.</p>
<p><strong>int. grocery store</strong>: Rick and the boys are in the
baby isle. Rick picks up a pack of Pull-Ups studies it for a moment and
throws it in the cart. On a community bulletin board he sees a flyer for
baby sitting. He pulls the flyer, folds it and stuffs it in his
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Big boys go potty on the potty, Nicholas.
Nicholas go potty on the potty?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re brothers go potty on the potty. Daddy
goes potty on the potty. Nicholas go potty on the potty?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Daddy will buy Nicky a toy from the store.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If Nicky goes potty on the potty.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I want a toy!</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I have to go potty?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: All done.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: How’s the potty training coming?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I think we’re making progress.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: Three hundred forty and…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Seventy-two cents. Here’s two- fifty.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: You’re still short.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know and I’m working on that.</p>
<p><strong>ms. heath</strong>: May I remind you that we’re not a
charity? If you need credit go to a bank. I run a reputable business and
I need the balance by next Wednesday, or maybe you should consider other
arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What happened? Where is he? Is he going to
be okay?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He’s going to be fine. They’re working on him
now. From what they told me it’s just a few stitches.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Boys will be boys. A NURSE peeks out.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Mr. Stevens can you come back? The doctor
could use your help in calming the child down.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Just go. I’ll watch these two.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, I need to give him a local so that I
can sew the laceration, but he’s not cooperating. Maybe hold his hand
and distract him?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hi little buddy.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Hi Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I need you to be a good boy, okay?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Okay daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, did you have fun today.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Did you play with all your friends?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: That fuckin’ hurts!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Phillip!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: But daddy, it does.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s a big people word. You’re a little
people, and little people don’t use big people words.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Do that again and my daddy’s going to kick
your ass.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Look I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sure, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: My son’s a wuss. He cries over hangnails. My
wife and I have tried everything to toughen him up, but nothing works. I
was wondering if our kids could play together. Maybe some of Phillip’s
“boy” would rub off on Junior.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yeah, Insurance. That thing that
covers medical emergencies?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t think I have any.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Everybody has insurance.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t think I do.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: the bill he holds shows a balance due of</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Can I run a tab?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: You don’t have a check?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m not even responsible for myself. How am I
suppose to raise three kids?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It can be done.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t see how.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Find a way. Everything happens for a reason.
God doesn’t abandon his children, and neither will you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: God doesn’t pay day-care.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: There are other things out there… less
expensive ways.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Could you watch them?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh… uh… well… I don’t think your father is
willing to do that. We raised our kids, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How `bout tonight, so I can catch a
breath?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What? My watching them while you were in
there with Phillip wasn’t enough? Make me feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll just ask God to watch them. He never
abandons his children.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Take this.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t want your money mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Take the money.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I can’t do it Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Would you do it for a nickel?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Watch daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Daddy go potty in the potty.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I peed.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m Melanie… The baby-sitter…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh, right, I’m glad you could…</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: My daddy has a big pee-pee.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I was just demonstrating the art of…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: It’s okay. I saw.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You have a kid.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not criticizing, just surprised. I don’t
believe anyone at their old day-care had kids. If they did they kept
them in a closet and only brought them out on special occasions.
Christmas, Easter, an occasional birthday, and maybe when they had
friends over for dinner, but only as a status symbol. It was like they’d
say, “Here’s the white picket fence. Here’s the SUV. Here’s the dog. Oh
yes, here’s the 2.5 children. Kids you can get back in the closet
now.”</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’d could make a fortune with a Renta-
Kid business.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That has potential.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’ve often thought of renting mine. Why pay
for a baby-sitter when thousands of people would pay good money to set
your kid on the mantle for a few hours?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m Zach.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello Zach. I’m Rick.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: You’re old.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You got me there. I am old.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: How old?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Older than dirt. When I was a kid we didn’t
have dirt. We had rocks and we had hammers. If we wanted dirt we banged
a few rocks with really big hammers, and then we had dirt.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Worked the chain gangs?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: You’re too old for my mom.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: This is Kristian. This is Phillip, and the
little guy from the potty, is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach and…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Mel.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Mel.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Beautiful kids.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Thanks. So’s your’s.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Ever try Cheerios?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: For potty training. Give him something to
aim at. Drop a Cheerio or two in the toilet and let him pee away.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ll have to try that. So, any questions about
the job? Melanie moves towards the boys.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m going to go talk to them for a little
bit. I’ll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: My mom tells great stories.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: We don’t have a mom.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: That’s okay, I don’t have a dad.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Once upon a time…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: The end…</p>
<p><strong>boys in unison</strong>: Read it again. Read it again. Read
it again.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m gonna talk to your dad.</p>
<p><strong>boys in unison</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: We’ll read another one in a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You have a real knack there.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Not a knack really. It’s just about finding
hope in places there should be none.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Whatever it is, I’ve never seen them take to a
woman like that. Melanie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You want the job?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re really funny… and kinda cute.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe we should…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Go out sometime? I’d like that. When?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know… maybe…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>int. small suburban home</strong>: Melanie on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: That was your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I love daddy.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Is he coming home?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: No, he’s going to be late. He has a
date.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So, I guess you have to deal with me a
little while longer.</p>
<p><strong>boys in unison</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re a single father? That’s wonderful. So
many men refuse to accept any responsibility for their kids. So, how
many do you have?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Um… three.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s amazing. I’m sure they’re just
angels.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: My sister has three. She said when the second
one was born it doubled the work. She didn’t realize the third would
double the work load would again. And to think you do it all by
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Um… kinda.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re a terrific man. Did I tell you I love
kids? They love me. It just comes so instinctively even though I’ve
never had kids myself. I get lots of practice with my nephews though.
So, when can I meet your boys?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: You’re not my mom.</p>
<p><strong>phillip and nicky</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>int. luigis - night</strong>: Rick motions for the check.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: A guy like you is so hard to find. I think
I love you and I think you need to love me too.</p>
<p><strong>int. small suburban home</strong>: Melanie lights a candle on
a table set for two.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That was incredible.</p>
<p><strong>woman 3</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know I haven’t known you very long, but I
there’s something I need to say…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Was it something I said?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Did you have a good time?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, it was good… kinda okay… pretty much
sucked.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why can’t I find a woman like you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’re trying too hard.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I feel bad for the boys. They don’t have a
“mom”. She’ll always be their mother, but she’ll never be their mom.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Quit trying so hard. You’re forcing issues
that can’t be forced. Relax. Everything happens when and how it’s
suppose to. It’s about spirit and finding the will to love again, for
you and the boys.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You want to stay and…</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m going to get…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Going?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Daddy, I have to potty.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>int. bath room</strong>: Rick is on his hands and knees
wiping the floor around the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Nicky almost do’d it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Almost, baby boy. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Finally had to grow up?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, I…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve got direction.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I suppose. I don’t know if you’d call it
direction, but there’s a definite sense of purpose.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, but is it good for the kids?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do the kids have direction?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Only two kinds of people make it in this
world, boy; Those that are smart and those that are strong. If you don’t
want to be smart and do your homework then you can be strong and do
pushups.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m probably not as demanding of them as I
should be.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have to instill a sense of direction at a
very early age.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So, Phillip what do you want to be when you
grow up?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Daddy says I can do three things when I
grow up.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And what are those? Phillip takes a deep
breath.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I can go to college and move the hell out
of his house. I can join the military and move the hell out of his
house, or I can get a job and…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: … move the hell out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Rick!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ya gotta let them be what they’re going to
be.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, you have to mold them early. If you don’t
mold them they’ll grow up to be Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And you do this with your kids?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s not the point, is it, Carrie?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I think Rick is doing a wonderful job.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s a struggle, going at it alone, but…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Excuse me, gentleman, I need to powder my
nose.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whining about being single. Married men would
kill to be in your situation!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m just saying it’s hard.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have your sons to raise without feminine
interference. Do you understand the significance of your situation? Do
you understand the power in your circumstance?</p>
<p><strong>int. night club - night</strong>: Rick takes a swig of his
beer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Men, all over the world, would kill for that
kind of power.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have the kids and she pays child support…
and you sit here and whine about things being hard? Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It does have its advantages, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Another?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He went to grab a couple beers.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You know Rick, someday some girl is going to
realize what a good man you are.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Carrie, I don’t even have the funds to buy my
own beer.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Love isn’t about money. Love is about truth
and selflessness and discovering who you are and who’ll be. Someday,
someone will find you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’ll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What was that for?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: For finding me.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Have to potty, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go potty, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>int. frank ryan’s office - day</strong>: Frank sits at his
desk.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thank you for everything, but it’s time to
move on.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where are you going? What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know, Frank, but I’m worth more than
this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’ll never make it without me!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Phillip, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Well, I wanted that piece and Kris took
that piece, and I really, really wanted that piece.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What’s so important about that piece?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: It’s bigger.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Easy on the drinks guys.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What’s wrong, Phillip?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I gotta pee and Kris…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’re not going to fight over the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh? Oh, this? Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: This time mine’s bigger.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m really glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I took off work to be here.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I want to see your boys.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m their mother.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You forfeited that obligation, remember?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You abandoned your kids!</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I did not. I left them in the care of their
loving father. There’s a difference.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Is there?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I just want to see the boys.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You think they even know who you are?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m their mother.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You keep saying that.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I know things can never go back to the way
they were before.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Next…</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Rick? Rick? Rick?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Let’s keep the attorneys out of this and
settle things like civil adults.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hi guys.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: This is a surprise. Leave work to spend the
day with us?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Come on guys. Someone is here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Rick? Rick?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Three hours.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: They’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Where are you going.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Anywhere you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What about the boys? What about me?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m all about second chances, but not when
I come in second place.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Why was she here? What was that?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s their mother.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Mother? I’ve been more of a mother than she
ever was.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s their mother.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Who willingly walked out of their
lives.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s their mother.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You keep saying that.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You think this is easy? You think raising
these boys is something I want to do alone? Every day is like a prison
sentence. Every thing I do, every decision I make is directly affected
by the boundaries of my responsibility. I have three children, but I
have no me. Everywhere I go people stare at me…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: They stare at me, and I know what they’re
thinking…</p>
<p><strong>ext. city streets - day</strong>: A PEDESTRIAN drops a coin
in ricks coffer.</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: You poor, poor man. You poor, poor
children. How unfortunate to only have your father. How terrible it must
be not to know your mother.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What about Zach? How noble of you to be the
only single parent in the world. How stoic you are… so concerned with
the best interests of your children. Too bad. Their best interest is
walking out the door.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: When can we see you again?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Someday.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Is someday tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Someday is someday, baby.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Give your Mom a hug, guys, then get in the
house.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: For?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I thought things had changed.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: But?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I am who I am, Rick. I’m not cut out to be a
mommy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I could have told you that.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I had to give it a shot. Rick turns to walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: At whose expense? Huh, Cindy? At whose
expense? Who’s going to dry their tears tomorrow when they realize your
never coming back? Who’s going to rock them to sleep at night when they
ask why mommy doesn’t love them?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: You are, and you wouldn’t have it any other
way.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Is Mel coming today?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I love Mel.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She loves you too.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Daddy… Daddy… Dad!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Don’t you yell! If you have something to say,
come here and tell me.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Phillip’s in the closet</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What were you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Being Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Who locked the door?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Wasn’t me…</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Rick?… Rick?… Rick?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Take care of my babies.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What are you giving him money for?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: To help him through the hard times. He’s a
good father, just having a rough go.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’ve never met a good father that couldn’t
support his kids.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You could watch the boys while he works.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m too old for that. The better side of
life has passed me by. What if they fall? I don’t hear like I used to.
What if one of them was seriously hurt and I didn’t hear their cry? I
hate that the only thing I feel competent to do is give them money. I
love my son and I love my grandbabies, but how would I live with myself
if something happened to those children?</p>
<p><strong>representative</strong>: Sir, you’re 3 months behind on your
electric bill.</p>
<p><strong>representative</strong>: It’s a start, but not nearly
enough.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: I always knew you were a lifer.</p>
<p><strong>adoption agent</strong>: Because of their age it may take
awhile. We’ll start them out in foster care, but eventually they’ll all
be placed in loving, nurturing environments.</p>
<p><strong>int. adoption agency</strong>: Rick snaps back from his
daydream.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: They’ll be together though, right?</p>
<p><strong>adoption agent</strong>: Mr. Stevens, I wish I could make
that promise, but the odds of an adoptive family willing to take them
all is astronomical.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Come on guys we’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>adoption agent</strong>: Mr. Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry, I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Can I get some help here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Can you help him?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: What does he need?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: He needs a father, not a book reading
baby-sitter.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can’t fucking do this.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Yes you can.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Use your mind and your heart. It’s
different than it ever should have been… but different isn’t wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: But I…</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: Use what you have. There is a vein of
wealth inside you just waiting to be mined. Think differently than you
have ever thought before. Worker harder than you ever thought you could.
Love these children like they’ve never been loved before.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: The answer lies within. Quit worrying about
how these misguided events have torn your life apart. Quit dwelling on
all of your misgivings. Look around you. You’re not alone. But you, and
you alone, will make the difference.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s not worth a lot, maybe a few hundred
bucks, but it might keep you in soap for a year.</p>
<p><strong>case worker</strong>: Mr. Stevens, I can see you now. Rick
and the Pregnant Woman lock eyes.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: I ain’t some charity case. I know
what you think when you look at me. You think; Look at that poor, poor
woman. Look at those poor, poor children. How unfortunate it must be
that they only have a mother. How terrible it must be not to know their
father.</p>
<p><strong>case worker</strong>: Mr. Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I didn’t mean it like that?</p>
<p><strong>pregnant woman</strong>: No one ever does.</p>
<p><strong>case worker</strong>: Mr. Stevens?</p>
<p><strong>case worker</strong>: Mr. Stevens? I can see you now.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m going to have to
reschedule.</p>
<p><strong>case worker</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Responsibility calls.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Please daddy? Please? Rick opens the book
so all can see.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Once upon a time…</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Daddy, I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: It’s very, very empty.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Daddy, I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Get your coats on.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: We’re leaving guys.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Thirty-two hundred and fifty-six dollars.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Think it’s bad now? Wait til they’re
teenagers.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Mom, I have an idea, but I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Put your checkbook away. What I need you can’t
buy.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What do you need.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: For you to believe in me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I know you.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Rick’s ex-wife?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Can I ask you a question? What is Phillip’s
favorite color?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Blue. His favorite color is blue. How many
teeth has Kris lost?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I don’t know. Why?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Four. Two on top and two on bottom. He got
a quarter for the first one, fifty cents for the next two and he
parlayed the last into an even dollar. Nicholas cries at night because
he thinks the house is filled with ghosts. Kiss him once on the
forehead, once on the cheek and sing The Cradle Will Rock and he’ll
sleep the whole night through. Kris’ favorite subject is math. He loves
to read and write, but he doesn’t do so well in social studies. He knows
how to ride a bike. Why? Because I taught him. Phillip wants to learn
but he’s always afraid he’ll fall. Nicky just likes to Flintstone his
tricycle. Phillip’s favorite cartoon is Tunenami.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: What’s your point?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m more their mom than you’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: So, why are you here with slick and not with
“your” kids?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Things change.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Yeah… yeah they do. Now if you’ll excuse me I
need to find the asparagus. I couldn’t do it, ya know?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: I always thought I wanted to be a parent, and
I was really good at being pregnant, but I sucked as a mom. I know that
now. I don’t have what it takes.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever felt as much pity
for anyone as I do for you right now.</p>
<p><strong>cindy</strong>: Take care of my boys… all of them.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Well, guys, I guess this is it.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: We can do it daddy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes we can.</p>
<p><strong>climber</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes we can.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What is it, Kris?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Look daddy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. gorge park - day</strong>: Rick holds a college
pamphlet. Rick’s POV: He looks at the pamphlet then up to see they
aren’t even close to the top. They have just reached a plateau along the
way.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: We can do it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes we can.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the chapel - day</strong>: Rick and the boys, hand in
hand, walk toward the church.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Kris!</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: What’s wrong? What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Not you, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: What then?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Put the stone down.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No buts: Put the stone down.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I knew this was a hard climb, but…</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: Long way up.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: Long way down for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That too.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So, what’s your point.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: No point, just an observation.
Drink?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: For the boys.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: Daddy, I’m thirsty. Rick studies the
climber for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: You know, if you stop here, halfway
between a long way up and a long way down you really haven’t
accomplished much, have you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We’re not stopping. We’re just resting.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: That’s what I said, fourteen years
ago. Rick looks toward the top.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We can do this.</p>
<p><strong>resting climber</strong>: Yes you can.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: We can do this!</p>
<p><strong>boys in unison</strong>: Yes we can!</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: What is so important Mr. Stevens that
you would burden this court with convening today?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I just needed clarification.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know if I have to, I can do this alone, but
do I have to do this alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the audience. The
Judge RAPS his gavel on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Order in this court! A beat as things quiet
down.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in the best
interest of the children or in the best interest of you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: He doesn’t know. He just doesn’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Then this court sees no reason to amend the
original verdict. The order stands.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Tell it to someone who cares,
Mr. Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I have. I have laid my heart out on the line
time and time again, only to walk away empty handed. This love, this
caring, this sharing of life, it’s a sentence and my heart has been
condemned. It doesn’t matter who I’ve told, what’s in my heart is never
quite enough. The people I have cared for most have shunned me in life
and in love. Unanswered phone calls… Unnoticed displays of affection… A
rose that withers on the doorstep… No matter what I do, it’s never
enough. Just once, just one fucking time, I want to be enough.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Your only condemnation is self- pity.
You have people that care all around you, but you’re too blind to see
them. If you don’t pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon
will all be gone.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m a proud man, sometimes foolish.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I have a long way to go before I could ever be
the man you need me to be.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And I got confused between what I should have
done and what I thought was right.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I put you on a pedestal and then I knocked you
down. It wasn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Life’s not fair Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You were more a mother to my boys than they
have ever known. You were more a woman to me than I have ever
deserved.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re not going to make this easy, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Cut the bullshit, Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can live my life alone. I can raise my kids
alone. I can walk this path alone. I’d much rather do it with you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Can’t?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I shouldn’t have come here.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: No, you shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You just don’t get it do you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Get what?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You’re here for you, you selfish prick.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Days go by when I lose me. There are nights
when I lay in bed and I can hear Zach through the walls. He’s crying out
for me, and I lay there motionless, wishing I was anyone but me,
anywhere but here, thinking that somewhere, sometime, there has to be
room for me. But that someday never seems to come. You’re dangerous.
Loving you means I lose me. And I will never lose let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: I could have looked sad.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I can look sad too.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: But I look sadder.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I sad.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: Don’t quit, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Daddy doesn’t quit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You love her?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I think so… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If you think you’re in love you are.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I suppose I am.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks
by?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She’s my best friend… or was.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does your heart skip a beat when she walks
by?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do your palms sweat when you think about
her?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does she inspire you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: With music and poetry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And is there passion?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: There’s fire.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And have you ever told her this?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: She knows.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you ever told her this?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you think you should?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It only confuses things.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Loving your best friend confuses things? I
can’t think of a love more lucid. Rick stands to leave.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know I’ll never forgive you for this,
don’t you? You had the power and the dream at your fingertips and you’re
giving it all away.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You didn’t marry your best friend?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought you had things all planned out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Affairs of the heart and those of the mind are
two different things.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s not too late, you know?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Go Home, John. Go home and talk to your best
friend the way you talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I need you to watch the boys.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But you’re father…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Woman, enough.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No more excuses. It’s time to live life and
enjoy our grandkids. Go. The boys will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Can’t we just give him money to pay for a
baby-sitter?</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant</strong>: Melanie is working as a waitress.
She’s pouring coffee when she sees Rick.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Pay attention, would ya?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: To talk.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So, where are the boys?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: They’re at my parents.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: What? Not going to use them to try to
persuade me with guilt?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Is that what you thought?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I have a son of my own. I know when people
are using their kids.</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Excuse us for a moment okay?</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: I’d just like some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: Excuse me, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What is your problem?</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: Cold.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: The coffee, it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Quit your bitching.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I can’t believe you came here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can’t believe you’re a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Beats chasing around after snot nosed brats
all day.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I thought you liked my kids.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I was talking about you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I deserved that.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So, what do the kids need? A babysitter? A
surrogate mom?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: This isn’t about the kids.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Then what’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s about me, the selfish prick.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: About you?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hear me out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You have 15 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Melanie, there is a grace about you that
reminds me how clumsy I am. There is an honesty about you that reminds
me how deceitful I can be. There is a beauty in your eyes that reminds
me how ugly I’ve become. There is a kindness in your voice that
contradicts my coarseness. There is a glow around you that illuminates
my dullness. There is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but
most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to
be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. A desire to be better
than I am or ever thought I could be.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I think my ten seconds are up.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Who’s counting?</p>
<p><strong>customer 2</strong>: Miss… My coffee?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Get it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I don’t think I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: If I give you my heart will you promise to
treat it softly? Kiss it when it hurts? Put it in a box and know that it
belongs to you?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: That’s not what you said.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I said I love you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: As brutal as that can be?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I love you. I love you, I love you, I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I kind of like you too.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I never thought you’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Been waiting long?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: I never thought you’d find me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I had to find me first. I hope you plan on
walking, cause I’m not sure I can carry you.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So, how do we do this? The two begin the
ascent together.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: One step at a time?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Side by side?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe you could carry me?</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Getting out of here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: If you leave don’t ever come back.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Not even…</p>
<p><strong>jailer</strong>: Not even on a visit. You’re a very ugly man.
I’d hate to explain to the other guards why you’d come to visit me.</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Grandma?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, Kris?</p>
<p><strong>kris</strong>: Grandma I love you.</p>
<p><strong>phillip</strong>: I love her more.</p>
<p><strong>nicholas</strong>: I love her the whole universe.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I love you all the whole universe plus
one.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: So, this is where it all happened.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: It’s funny, the tricks the mind can play on
you… but the Judge, he sat right over there… and the jury sat right
there… and the audience was filled with all these people who didn’t
really give a shit about me.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: A bunch of innocent bystanders?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And they all sat passing judgement on me, not
knowing the situation, just staring over their schoolmarm spectacles and
pointing their crooked fingers.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: All the world’s a stage.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Always casting dispersions.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Guilty as charged.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Nothing… nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The secret of life, Melanie, is to always pay
attention…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: … always be prepared for what’s right around
the corner. The CRACK of the bat.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Duck!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
