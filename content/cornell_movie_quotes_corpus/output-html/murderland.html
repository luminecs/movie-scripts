<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, the official mascot
of Murderland…. Scraps the Dog !</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Choose the doorway that starts you on
your magical journey into MURDERLAND !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t think he’d make it past Scraps.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Let’s just see if he can make it into round
two….</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t eat at the console.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What ? Are you my mother ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s my control board and I don’t want it
acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no
put the shit away.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yes, sir Mom.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Have a seat Mr. Simpson ! Murderland was
created in 1987. Taking the original 82nd street subway station which
was abandoned in 1913, our engineers were able to construct all thirty
rides in less than……</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: ….. all thirty rides and attractions !
Our engineers have built…..</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Never underestimate a man who cheats on his
taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass
couldn’t win the special Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Mr. Simpson, so many doors, so many
choices. Which do you prefer ?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Chose wisely and with expediency !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’ll never get it right. Try the Log Ride
!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: But, he’s…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I said NO.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Stop the hydraulics.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Is that it ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, I’d say that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I
think we don’t need an autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m just looking for our best interests. May I
have the tapes, Bruce ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Doesn’t it bother you to see this kind of
brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man’s infatuation with
the stuff, but not you.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’m an investment banker. I see blood bathes
everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or
die.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No one has a gun to your head.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Might I suggest going a little easier on them
? It will prolong the end and our benefactor will be more pleased if we
could elongate the inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Johnny, let’s get the cleanup started.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’ve got it boss. One more mangled body to
the East River, coming up !</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I must be going. Gentlemen….</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So have you seen Simpson ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: No, why ?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He missed a meeting this morning. Simpson
hasn’t missed a meeting in three years.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Maybe he had a better offer.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It doesn’t matter much. There’s such an
incredible turnover here… Be careful, major kiss ass approaching.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Did you see what the First Bank stock opened
at ? Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Actually it’s down .2 from the last
quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I am equally impressed with your knowledge of
the market. How long have you been with the company now ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Four years. I came over from the Capitol
merger in Chicago six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Were you involved in the incident where that
guy killed himself in his office ? I am sorry. Perhaps we should have
dinner tonight to…. discuss your future.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Perhaps not. I have to work on the PRD
merger tonight.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Good golly miss molly you are looking good
today !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I meant him.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg
off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of
ties ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Might I remind you Mr. Parker, that you are a
temporary employee and I hope you have no aspirations of becoming
permanent.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Thank you sir, have you ever considered
Mydol for that attitude. It takes the edge off.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Hi. I’m John C. McCay. I am proud to
have the new PRD team join the family. We all know that we grow
everyday. Together we can make First Bank work for you.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: Well ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Fire the whole division.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: Excuse me, sir ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Fire the whole division. We’re moving
more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left
over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the
key people here. Anyone else is expendable.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: Sir, I came from the Chicago offices
myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good….</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: If you want, I can fire you and have
someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which
will it be ?</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: We will start work on it now sir.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: Anyone know where to start ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: We start with the top and work our way down.
We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go.
No need to make the blue collars go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I disagree. I think we should start looking
into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families
can…..</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Look, Miss. I know you’re still upset about
that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business.
We don’t have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Maybe we should make the time. Especially
considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to
settle law suits from these very events.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: Let’s put it to a vote. All those in
favor of cutting loose without the proper relations to our old co
workers ? Put your hands up.</p>
<p><strong>fred thomison</strong>: That about covers it then. Now the
next order of business will be…..</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Zachory ! My boy, how goes the
carnage down on 44 ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too
many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a
charity ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Relax, son. They’ll learn in time
that you don’t fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to
keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong
Survive.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps
Nietzsche ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Perhaps it was. I was in boarding
school for so many years, it’s hard to remember. Do you have the tape of
the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes sir, I do. Last night’s, fresh from the
Park.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I have to say, that I am glad you are
such an amazing kiss ass.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question
?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: While I am not morally against these little,
shall we say “hobbies”, as long as I am on the payroll, but why not
something like a yacht club ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Zach, how old are you, son ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I am thirty two.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: And how much do we pay you annually
?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I make roughly four hundred thousand a
year.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly
salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I
wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon. My father formed this
company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally
challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is
very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht
club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I have entrusted you with a great
many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard
things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I
think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for
shares, or possibly cash… but this, this is really personal.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Son, let’s watch the tape.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: That was rather…. disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I had suggested that they tone down the
program so that the “guests” might take longer to expire.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I want more action. I want to see
more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the
machines !</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: But sir, most of the people we are putting
into the “Park” are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers.
They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I don’t believe Ol’ Bruce is having
as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the “guests”
being of the more nefarious type.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: That’s right, sir. He does a thorough
background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of
embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last
three suggested “guests”.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: What about that time when the mail
room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the “Park” ? Wasn’t
that a computer glitch ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man
into the “park” and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine.
That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: That mail room kid was the longest
lasting “guest” yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make
another “guest” from the more athletic of our staff.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that
he is becoming more belligerent.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I propose we consider a hostile take
over. Perhaps Ol’ Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What do you mean sir ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: What if we were to put Bruce into the
Park as a Guest ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sir ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I’ll bet that would be the Park run
of the century !</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to
circumvent any of the traps.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: I’m willing to bet that even the
creator can’t out wit his creation.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What then sir ? What would we do with the park
with out Bruce ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Do you think the assistant, what’s
his name…</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: John, sir.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Yes, do you think he would like a
raise and a new position ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We
can’t predict what will happen.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: That my boy, is the best part. Life
on top of the world is boring… predictable. If I wanted life without
chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal
proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it’s viable.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Come on, I’m serious. Look at Wilma. She’s
this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG
guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT’s why Wilma puts up with
his B.S.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’ve never heard the Flintstones reduced to
a sexual exploitation quite like that. You’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you
go, it’s I think you’re…</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Do you want to go out with me ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s sounds so much better when you say it.
I’m semi traditional here, and it’s important that I ask. Will you go
out with me ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Really ? On a date ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: This is too easy, I mean I had a speech
prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees
to grovel.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: As appealing as that sounds…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven
o’clock ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I can’t believe she said yes !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I know. Normally I’d have to spend weeks
laying down the leg work to land a beautiful baby like that.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: You are so lucky that Zach didn’t get there
first.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You mean Mr. Bad Ties ? I wasn’t worried
about him. He’s one of those guys who has a wardrobe but no personality.
Saundra doesn’t want that. She wants someone who can MAKE her laugh. Not
someone she can laugh AT.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hand me the 3/8ths.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Here. Am I ever going to get to run the
controls for one these capers ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: When I think you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: When will that be ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: When you are ready.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Look, you’re going to have to start trusting
me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Trust is earned not given away.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is
given away to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not down here. I’ll start trusting you when I
feel there the time is right. It’s not personal, it’s just survival.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ve been working with you for four years,
don’t you think that’s worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I made my bones on the street, you know. I
did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: And who bailed you out when a hit was put on
you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s right. Now who needs to trust who ?
Trust me, when you’re ready to work the controls, I’ll put you in the
hot seat.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I just think that maybe I am…..</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Jesus Christ ! Stop Stop Stop !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You asshole ! They could have missed !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor
?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: We have new “guests” for the park. I have a
file on them. May I see Bruce ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s been expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: No. I was just curious if what I heard about
you is true ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What did you hear ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Only that you were one of the finest hit men
in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli
was the man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: There was a bit of confusion on one of my
last jobs.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I thought, and correct me if I’m wrong, but
weren’t you trying to play both sides ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What are you looking for ? A blow job ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: No. I am not a homosexual.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Then what do you want ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Have you ever considered running your own
“Park” ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former
profession.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t think even this company could
afford to write off enough to build a new “Park”.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Are you happy with your salary and position
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No I am not.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I had hoped you would say that. I have a
proposal for you…..</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Good morning. What do you have today ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I have an embezzler and his accomplice.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: This young man is a temporary in our
accounting department and he has managed to steal a large sum of money
through the wire transfer system. He is sleeping with one of our account
executives to gain passwords. We believe she is in on it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ll do the standard research and have them
in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s wrong ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I just want to double check the facts.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I see here that this guy has made deposits
into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of
$100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He already had a balance of $600,000.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He probably has a history of this shit.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, maybe…. Let’s start the background
checks. Let’s see where they live and what kind of security
systems….</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda
posh for a temp don’t you think ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Any priors ? Any police record ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Checking….. Hah ! He has a shit load of
unpaid parking tickets…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Parking tickets ? That’s it ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, but we’re talking 43.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: A real criminal…. I still think that’s our
in… What about her ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Checking……..</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hi. I brought some wine.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Thank you, won’t you come in ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What an incredible view !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Are you okay ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Yes, Excuse me for a second.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: You have a real nice place… how can you
afford this working as a temp ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Well, I make good investments, I lead a
double life as a secret agent.. I….I … I have very rich parents. I have
always had a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: If they’re so rich, why are you working at
all ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I just want to have something that’s mine,
you know ? It’s like living off of their money is fun and all. There are
certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with
that extra little scratch.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Would that impress you ? I mean you’re the
kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal
ad.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Actually, I’m more interested in the man
behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have
that makes you a materialistic fool ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: My own sit down Star Wars arcade game.
Wanna play it ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot
Vader’s Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Yahoo !!!!!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Are you Matthew Parker ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or
something ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s very funny, sir. You are under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey , Hey !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You
have the right to remain silent, anything you say can &amp; will be
held…..</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What’s going on ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Please don’t be alarmed, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid
parking tickets.</p>

him for parking tickets ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Run !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No matter how many times I wear one of those
fucking uniforms, I’ll never get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That about does it. I’ll take them down.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nighty night, boss.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: So who are these people with the Boss ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who
turned me down for the night of her life.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Aren’t you the bitter one.</p>

<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Well that’s ….</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I told you this would be easy. Just like a
maestro.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What the hell kind of cop are you ?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Murderland was created in 1987. Taking
the original 82nd street subway station which was abandoned in 1913, our
engineers were able to construct all thirty rides in less than……</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What is Bruce doing ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t know…..</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What was that ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it
!</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: We can’t afford too many surprises.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’ll never make it out of the park alive. I
promise you that….</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I gotta sit down, I have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: NO. Don’t. You’ll get a shock from hell if
you touch that seat.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this
?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I think we should follow him…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I just need to sit and think for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I told him not to sit down in there…..</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Are you okay ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken
McNugget.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, boss you’ve already surprised me. I’ll
try not to let it happen again. Where to kids ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: The roof is coming down…. hey, you…. Which
door gets us out of here ??</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Which one, this door is locked !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: NO ! Don’t open ANY of them ! They’re all
wrong. Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Wait for what ? i don’t wanna alarm you but
we’ll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about
five minutes !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Trust me, if you open any door, you’ll be
dead a whole lot sooner.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Why should we trust you ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I made this place….. now listen to me. I’ll
get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this….</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Will he make it out ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Of course, this one’s a gimme. Just be
patient, even Ol’ Bruce can’t outwit some of these traps.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Okay, NOW I’m worried. What exactly is on
the other side of the door ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Either you’ll be shot with bullets, impaled
with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you’re
fucked any way you go.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: And that’s different than this because……
?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Okay, maybe you know the answer to this,
but I’m still the trivia champion at BW3’s.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Come on boss man ! Don’t you wanna play ?
You’ve never beaten me on the table up in the bar…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding me !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That’s the way ! Look at her go !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What about Matt ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Leave him, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: No !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Fuck ! That’s not fair ! She cheated !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there
!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t help criminals.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Criminals ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What’s next ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I have a turn for the worse for the team
!</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased
with the tape of this one.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hey Mr. Personality ! Stop for a
second.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m talking to you asshole !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Maybe all that testosterone plugs his
ears.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Give me one good reason why I don’t plug you
right here, right now ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Because of my charming personality ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Why don’t you tell us what the fuck is
going on ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Why should I ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: You said we were criminals, what did you
mean ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You’re both embezzling. I saw the
records.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Embezzling ? I’m not embezzling !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes
you an accessory. He stole your passwords.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m not fucking him..</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You don’t have to sound so emphatic.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: We just having our first date when you
showed up.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’d hurry it up, love birds. You don’t want
to see what happens when you don’t keep the lines moving.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You said you built this place ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I think you have WAY too much free time on
your hands. What about other hobbies ? I mean what’s wrong with building
toy trains or something.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yes, get in.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Awk ! This sucks !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: This isn’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Oh Shit !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Is it over ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not quite….</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: That’s it folks for the Demon Boat Ride….
Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Where’s the dock ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I think that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Oh SHIT !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey, where are you going ? Hey !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: That’s nice. I think I lost my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’d get out of the water if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Why ?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now ladies and gentlemen it’s time
for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Great ! You couldn’t be a fan of Dolphins
or some other less threatening animal.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Matt !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Now what ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who can make it to the exit alive ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ve got five bucks that says someone dies
here and now.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I’ll see that bet.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Now where do we go ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I thought you made this place ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I did, but this room has four exits and only
one opens, it’s up to them in the control room. There’s one right over
there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Fuck ! He’s toying with us.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Shit here comes a crock ! Here it
comes.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Get ready to hand over that fiver.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The crocks will eat him up before they come
after us, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: You were saying ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Aren’t you going to switch exits on him again
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead
crock. There’s no fun in it. Besides we’ve got plenty more for them. The
night is young….</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What’s next Walt ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: A dragon.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: So what happened ? Did you have a real bad
theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Be very, very quiet…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Are you hunting wabbits ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The room has sound sensors. If you wake it
up, it breathes fire.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You were one of those guys that played
Dungeons &amp; Dragons with real swords, weren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Shhhh !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Keep moving, keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: How do we get out of this room ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We wait. This is an elevator.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: An elevator ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, we’re about a hundred an fifty feet
below the subway stations. We’re heading a little higher up now.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: How’s your foot ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: “How’s your foot” ? This guy tried to kill
us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is
?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s fine thanks.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Why don’t you tell us a little about
yourself ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look pipsqueak, I’m having a real bad day
here and we’re just starting.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Now what the hell are we supposed to do
?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We have to climb up that.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: That’s not to tough.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s enough force to push you twenty feet
in the air. It won’t kill you, but it will hurt.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: You have issues. I mean you have some
serious issues that need to be ironed out.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Issues ??? This guy has the damn
subscription to every psychotic issue I’ve ever heard of.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s cute asshole.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Let’s see if the lovely contestant can
make it to the top in three minutes !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: That was close.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey, try swimming. It works.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Swimming, you know, like in water,
moron.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Come on, it works.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Give me a fucking…..</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You okay ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ow…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We have to climb up these slides.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: You have about sixty seconds !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hurry ! Hurry !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: How do we get up to the top ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What ? Don’t you remember ? You know
everything else but this ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I remember ! Here, here !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: This probably isn’t the bet time, but I
really have to pee. Can I pee ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: NO !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What do we do now ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why don’t you get in ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Welcome to the Men’s Room !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m a little self conscious here. I can’t
urinate if you’re gonna be watching from the video camera.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Maybe you should get over fears.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the
wardrobe of choice tonight. I’m quite confident that my tie is looking
better than yours.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: You son of a bitch ! I knew this wasn’t
about my parking tickets.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: That water there is piped in from the great
toilets of the upper class. I hope you brought a snorkel.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: So where does this lead ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No where. We’ve got about seven minutes
before this thing slams into a concrete wall.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: So what do we do ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this
place ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s called Murderland. It’s paid for by
First Bank.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: First Bank ? But how ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s a tax write off for John C. McCay.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: McCay knows ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Knows ? He watches every “Guest” on tape.
This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I got it ! get over your fear.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Oh god, this is bad.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Look he figured it out !</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I can see your small business ! Look at it
it’s so small.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I know that this might seem like the right
time to come out of the closet, but believe me, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Unless of course the guy your with is your
lover. By all means let it out. Start sharing the gay love.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Ha ! yes Yes Yes !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Cardinal rule, lovebirds, once you start
peeing you can’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What are you doing ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Look ! Look !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the
boss man wasn’t as tough as I thought.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe we should watch the tape
to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re paying the bills.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey ! Hey ! I’m talking to you !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You took an awful big risk back there.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Look I don’t even wanna know how I got in
this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If you hadn’t started boffing that weasel
with an attitude, you wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then you didn’t give him any passwords of any
kind ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: NO ! I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Then he isn’t embezzling either is he ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Why would he ? His parents are rich.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: So many tubes to get in, only one is the
way out.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or
anything ?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Pick with expediency !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Don’t rush me or anything.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Blue IS my color.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Well isn’t this fun.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Ohhhhhh SHHHHHHITTT !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I am definitely going to see a
chiropractor.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Okay drivers ! Start your engines !</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Remember not to touch the floor or else…
You’ll get the shock of your life !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So you’re telling me you were set up ? I knew
something was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m not listening.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Hey ! I’m still your best chance to get out
of here alive.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: You’ve been doing a bang up job so far.
Right now Matt is probably dead and it’s your fault.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What’s Mr. Parker doing ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Zachary.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Zach, my boy ! How is tonights
adventure going ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Is it as good as I hope it is ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Better, sir.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: One moment dear…</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sir ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Not you Zach. Remember, my wife is
asleep upstairs, dear. Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ?
Is it the grandest of all the Park’s tapes ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes sir. It will be the best of your
collection, I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Fantastic ! A little faster
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Sir ? We’re moving them right along as fast as
we can.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Have that tape on my desk tomorrow
morning. First…. thing…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Was that the Old Man ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Yes. I think he’s feeling sick or
something.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: There ! There ! Did you see ! They’re still
alive !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I can see that but where ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It won’t take them that long to figure out we
weren’t on the train when it wrecked.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Not listening !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Look, there’s another train. They’ll send it
through here. You’re fucked if you don’t STOP and listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: At the subway station, we can get into a
power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn’t know
about.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Okay, I’ve got the other train coming around
now.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Shit, it’s too late. The other train’s
coming.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Any ideas ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He found us already. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Thought you had me there didn’t you Bruce !
Just goes to show that the tail can wag the dog.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What’s the trick here ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We drown.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Obviously, but what’s the way out ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Once the room depletes it’s oxygen, we have
about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we
swim out.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: How long till the room fills ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’d say about thirty to forty minutes. Give
or take a few.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: He’s got a real complex about being on camera,
doesn’t he ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: So why this ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Excuse me ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Why did you build this whole place ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Is this really the time ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Do you have something better to talk about
?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering.
That’s when John McCay hired me.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: He hired you to build this place ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I was hired in and started to do the boring
old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor.
First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I was asked to design something for
Mr. McCay. I had no idea what it was. I though it was going to be a real
amusement park.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: When I first saw the abandoned subway tunnel,
I still had no idea what it was he wanted done. I started work on the
park.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is when I found out the truth….</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: They wanted a few changes in the design.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is when they told what it was really
for. They said that the people that would be sent down here would only
be criminals, the scum of the world.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I remember the first guest. He was an
accountant that had raped his daughter. He went to trial with the best
lawyers and got off. McCay used this as an opportunity. We nabbed him
and put him in Murderland.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is how I got started.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I was lured by all the money and I truly did
convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has
wanted to put anyone he can down here.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: But how do you know if the people are
guilty ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I do a very thorough background check. I go
through police files, personel files, anything.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Then how come Matt and I showed up as
guilty ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It was there, clear as day. I saw the
computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal
account. I just knew something was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: So you may have been duped this whole time.
Killing innocent people, that must make you feel …, how does it feel
?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There are other things too. They had everyone
start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Yeah, everyone has to when they get
hired.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s more to it than trying to see if
you’d steal from the company or if you’d lie or cheat.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What do you mean ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: McCay had a lot money done into researching
psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but
reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses…..</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: And you believe that ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ve since changed my mind. I designed this
place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system
couldn’t or wouldn’t do. McCay had the company buy the property and they
pay the bills. It’s a tax write off. On the books everything looks
kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven’t seen in ten years.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Doesn’t anyone notice all the people
missing ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not
even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught
trying to steal McCay’s Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to
walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought
that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after
hours.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: How can you just take a life ? I mean it’s
a life, life is so precious. How does it feel ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What do you do with the company, if I might
ask ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m in charge of the conversions. When
First Bank buys another smaller bank, I’m in charge of converting them
to our systems and way of doing things.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So when you took those jobs away last October
from the Mid West Central, and that guy killed himself, how did it make
you feel ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I… I …..</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You didn’t think about it did you ? I read
your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I wanted to let his family know….</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Know what ? That it was your fault ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: It wasn’t my fault. I was just part of a
team. I was doing my job…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: So was I. So don’t give me any shit. Your
business is just as bad. At least I’m up front about it. You kill people
slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood
over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: That is repugnant. You have the habits of a
goat.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Ach ! How will you know if they’ve made it
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The room will fill to the top, then if they
wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just remember, hold your breath as long as
you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in
and up.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: You okay ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Shit they made it.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Goddamn it Bruce, you’ve cost me about
thirty dollars so far.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why don’t you just stop fucking around and
just die !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m sick of playing. I’ve got a better
idea.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I thought I lost you there for a second boss
man.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh, oh.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If we can get to through the next room, we’ll
be at a junction for a power grid.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: This is cute.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the
lightening is real.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You don’t. It’s random, there no trick.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Great…</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for
them.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I think I’ll see hat action.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Where are we going ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Get Up ! Keep coming. Come On !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Isn’t that touching.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Isn’t that cute !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Come on, get up ! You can make it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Okay, just stop yelling.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Give me my five back.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: So what’s next ? No one’s ever made it this
far before.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s got two chices.either it’s the Bowling
Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that
no one can make it out of here in one piece.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Being the fair guy that he is, Bruce
designed this place so that there is one solution to every room. If you
can make it through all thirty rooms, you live. No one’s made it past
seven till now.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: You must come in first place to move on
!</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jesus, my legs are asleep. I’ll never be
able to win this shit.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I should have played more Nintendo racing
games.</p>
<p><strong>tree #1</strong>: Hey buddy, you got a light ?</p>
<p><strong>tree#2</strong>: You can’t smoke asshole, you’ll catch fire
!</p>
<p><strong>tree #3</strong>: Awe, let him smoke, what I need is a little
piece of ass !</p>
<p><strong>tree#2</strong>: What are you going to do ? Leaf fuck him ?
You’ve got no genitalia ! You Are A Tree ! Get it ?</p>
<p><strong>tree #1</strong>: You just stop that or I’ll……</p>
<p><strong>tree#2</strong>: Oh God ! That smells downright rank !</p>
<p><strong>tree #3</strong>: Yikes, I shouldn’t have had that taco !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Quick, drink this !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink
it.</p>
<p><strong>tree#2</strong>: You guys disgust me !</p>
<p><strong>tree #1</strong>: He hee hee hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>tree #3</strong>: Hey, pull my branch !</p>
<p><strong>tree #1</strong>: Hee hee hee hee heeh hee/</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Come on let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Here. Help me get the panel off.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Get back !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What the … ?</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: What happened ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The power went out in half the park.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: How can this happen ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t know. I think that a power grid just
needs reset. Don’t get your panties in a bunch. I’ll go down and reset
it.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, right. He’s stuck all the way over
here</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’ll never make it to the main power grid.
Those two are way over here… I’ll be over here trying to get the power
back up. It’ll only take a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey ! Hey ! What happened ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: No guts no glory. Of course without any
guts, I’d have a hard time keeping my food down.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Electrocuted my ass !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Do you know where you’re going ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What was that ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Girder, watch your head.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Here, we can take this service tunnel
straight to the end. No one knows about this but me. It’ll lead you out
to Central Park, and I’ll take care of my #2.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Well now Mr. Helper, I like the look of
this.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: What the hell will he think of next ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s kill us some weasel.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Steady ! Steady !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Wilbur, I have an itch on my ass, can you
scratch it ? Wi wi wi wi Wilbur !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s not polite to stare.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m sorry Mr. Ed ! I’m sorry Mr. Ed !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Where’s you get the gun Boss man ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I thought that you said we were at the START
of trust.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Jesus Christ ! I’m just a temp for Christ
sakes !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Shut up ! It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I think I’m very quickly getting over my
phobia of public urination.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Give it up Bruce. You can work the park
better, but I’m the better shot. You know it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why don’t you take some of this ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ahem….</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Turn your head a little more to the left.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Is it over ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Almost. Look, you two get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Where ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It
leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What about you ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: There’s one more person here for me to
visit.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It’s that asshole Zach isn’t it ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Zach from work ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’s the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go
now.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Don’t have to tell me twice.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Just stop it. End it here.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’ll end. It’ll end with him and McCay. Then
the park shuts down. Permanently.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: AHEM.</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: Might I suggest we…</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Kick your ass ? Don’t mind if I do</p>
<p><strong>zach</strong>: No !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Time to bitch slap the boss. Come on,
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Muther fucker !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: This is fitting. The Offices of the Damned.
This is as good as any place for you to die, you pond sucking piece of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Uh, Oh ! It’s the Boss !</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: You’re fired ! You’re fired ! You’re
fired !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside
from the one’s that nature gave you ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Another bad tie…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You think I’m that easy, Bitch ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: For once in your life, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: If I had known this is what it took to shut
you up, I’d have done it a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hey Matty, don’t wait for me or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I was thinking maybe we should try this
dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by
then….</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I’d be glad to
see Central Park at night.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: We made it !</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What now ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I want to go to sleep for about a
month.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: No, idiot. Where do we go now ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Where are we ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I don’t suppose any of you know how to get
to Park West from here ?</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: Wallets. Now.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: We don’t have anything.</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: Wrong answer. I think you better become less
fiscally challenged.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: It never rains, but it pours.</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: What the fuck did you just say, whitey !?!
Are you commenting on my Afro, muther fucker ? I am sick and tired of
lining the Man’s wallet.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Stick it to the Man is what I always say.
No, I was just saying what a shitty night we’re having. It was nothing
to do with your hair style or your mmmmmm hmmmm</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: That’s much better. Now wallets. Ya’ll white
folks think you can talk shit to me and I gotsta take it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Now I should have done that hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: This ain’t none of your bidness, man. You’re
distracting us from a financial transaction</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m sorry, is this distracting ? What about
this ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s much better. Just us.</p>
<p><strong>kareem</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: SLOWLY !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Now turn around. Hands on your head.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what
it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth
time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Come to the rescue again I see.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Let’s roll. We have about three quarter of a
mile to the edge of the park. They’ll be coming back full force and one
shotgun is not gonna scare off all of them. It’ll be daylight soon
too.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I got the real man’s workout tonight didn’t
I ? Where did he go ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: He was right behind me !</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Who was that guy anyway ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Zach, my boy ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Oh my this is better than we thought
it would be. I told you Ol’ Bruce would be the man if we put him in
there !</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Welcome to Murderland ! And Here’s Scraps
the official mascot for Murderland.</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Is this the best you can do, Bruce
?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Did you think I didn’t learn anything
from watching ALL those tapes ?</p>
<p><strong>john c. mccay</strong>: Even I can out run this thing. He
starts to walk a little away from under the table.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Hey good lookin’ ! What’cha got cookin’
?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Hey buddy. You okay ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Of course I am. I feel the testosterone
coursing through my veins. Now that I’ve gotten the stitches removed
from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Ow. Son of a ….. Did I ever tell you my
theory on Star Wars as Porn ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: Well, I think if you take several lines out
of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to
this. “Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?” or
“You came in that thing ? You’re braver than I thought”.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Excuse me, son. You’re not discussing a
sexual topic on company time here are you ?</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: No sir. I was just getting , well you know.
Water. We weren’t talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars.
Just saying hello. I think I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Why don’t you shut up now.</p>
<p><strong>matthew</strong>: I’m going to go ahead and go now.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: What are you DOING here ?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I work here, remember ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: That was eleven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, surprise, surprise, I’ve been on the
payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No
one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in
a multi corporation bank in New York ?</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Apparently pretty high, we just got a new
CEO last week.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That’s a shame.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Yeah a real shame.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I’ll see you at the next staff
party.</p>
<p><strong>saundra</strong>: Bye….</p>
