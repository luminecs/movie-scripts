<h1 id="the-beach">the-beach</h1>
<p><strong>ext. bangkok. night.</strong>: A single headlamp in close up
shines directly and brightly out Extreme noise and light. Beyond its
glare can be seen the outline of a motorized tricycle and its Thai
driver A young man, Richard, sits in the back, his rucksack beside him,
swaying with the motion of the vehicle. He is worn and sweating. They
travel through nocturnal Bangkok: fleets of tuk-tuks, taxis, road works,
food vendors, dogs, tourists. Music and credits.</p>
<p><strong>ext. khao san road. night</strong>: The bright headlight
comes to a halt. Richard climbs down from the tuk-tuk</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When you hit Bangkok, there’s really only
one place to go. The street is busy, full of Thai’s and travelers.
Richard picks his way through the crowd, his rucksack on his back. He
absorbs the scene as he passes boarding houses and hotels, and the shops
and stalls selling food, clothes, pirated tapes, jewelry, travel
tickets, and international phone calls. Restaurantes are filled with
western travelers watching American films or European sport.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The Khao San Road is a decompression
chamber between east and west. It’s where you learn to breathe car fumes
and tropical air for the very first time, or else carefully rearrange
your memories before you catch your flight home. Richard is approached
by a young male Thai Hustler who walks backwards in front of him while
making his pitch.</p>
<p><strong>hustler</strong>: You need somewhere to stay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll be OK, Thanks. Richard politely
ignores each of his subsequent offers.</p>
<p><strong>hustler</strong>: What do you want? Sell your passport? Buy
passport? Airline tickets? You want silk? I’ll take you to the best silk
place? You get a suit in twenty-four hours. Diamonds? You want to come
with me, you get present for your girlfriend. Maybe no girlfriend. You
want a girl, no problem. Good time. Boy girl fucking no problem. You
want to drink some snake blood? At this last one Richard stops and
addresses the Hustler.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No thanks. Richard walks on, the hustler
fading out behind him.</p>
<p><strong>hustler</strong>: You want designer clothes? I get you
Versache, Gucci, Armani, no problem. You want a camera, all the best
makes: Nikon, Leica, Canon I can get you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, it’s all here: you an phone home,
meet up with strangers, split up with your friends, watch Hollywood
movies while you sip Budweiser and eat a burger or get some massage and
green chicken soup. You could be anywhere in the world bu you could only
find it here. And what do they want, all these people?</p>
<p><strong>ext. khao san road. night./ int. bars and shops.
night.</strong>: Various young travelers, male and female, in snapsho9t
exerpts, address their comments to the camera or each other.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 1</strong>: Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>traveler 2</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>traveler 3</strong>: I’ve been there</p>
<p><strong>traveler 4</strong>: It’s a waste of time</p>
<p><strong>traveler1</strong>: We just got back</p>
<p><strong>traveler2</strong>: Fantastic</p>
<p><strong>traveler 3</strong>: How much did it cost?</p>
<p><strong>traveler5</strong>: A complete rip off.</p>
<p><strong>traveler3</strong>: Too many people. There’s a much better
place along the coast.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 4</strong>: We’re going exploring. We’ve read this
book. It tells us all the best places to explore.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 2</strong>: I know a place that everyone says is
really unspoiled.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 1</strong>: I heard they built a big hotel
there.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 5</strong>: Some sort of sewage problem,
apparently.</p>
<p><strong>traveler 1</strong>: We’re going anyway: all the rooms have
got air conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But for me it’s all about finding out
something about a place, and something about yourself. And when you get
off the beaten track, that’s where you find out what there is to find
out. Richard turns into one of the restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>int. restaurant. night.</strong>: The restaurant extends
deeply back away from the street. Richard passes many diners not
dissimilar to himself. Some are talking, many are engrossed in the video
entertainment. At the back he reaches a reception desk where he drops
his pack. A Thai female HOTEL RECEPTIONIST sits behind the desk. She
immediately shows Richard a “menu” of available rooms. The menu offers a
spread of prices for single/double/window/fan/aircon/bathroom. Richard
points to the cheapest combination and hands over 300 baht. The
Receptionist becomes aware that he is being started at. A worn,
disheveled man in his mid-thirties is standing at the nearby bar, a
bottle in his hand, studying Richard. This is Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Good evening. Daffy says nothing but
continues to stare and takes a drink. Richard will not be stared down.
Neither turns away. The Receptionist passes over a key and smiles
broadly.</p>
<p><strong>hotel receptionist</strong>: Welcome to Thailand. Richard
turns to her.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>int shower. night</strong>: In a small windowless shower
room, Richard stands motionless, eyes closed, facing with pleasure the
spray of cold water.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel corridor. night</strong>: The sound of the shower
can be heard through a door marked with a shower sign. The sound stops
and the door is opened. Richard emerges with a towel wrapped around his
waist, carrying his key and washbag. He walks the short distance to his
room. He puts the key in the door but the lock is stiff and he has to
fiddle with it, bent over and dripping water on the floor. While he is
doing so, the sound of footsteps climbing nearby stairs can be heard.
There is the sound of a loud wolf-whistle. Richard turns to the source
of the whistle. A beautiful European woman is smiling at him. This is
Francoise. She approaches and takes the key from his hand. She turns the
key in one direction, then the other, while twisting the handle.</p>
<p><strong>francois</strong>: Et voila. The door swings gently open. She
stands back</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thank you. Footsteps approach from the
stair. Francoise is joined by a young man, ETIENNE, who catches up with
her. He nods at Richard as he takes her arm. They walk away from Richard
to the next door.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Bonsoir.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Eh - bonsoir.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Goodnight. The couple reach their door.
They enter their room and the door is closed behind them. Alone in the
corridor again, Richard contemplates their presence.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I was traveling alone for two reasons.
First of all, being alone allows you more opportunity to absorb your
experiences on a personal level. Secondly, and this I felt acutely at
that moment, there was no one who wanted to go with me.</p>
<p><strong>int restaurant. night</strong>: Richard is in the restaurant
which is quiet now. He is alone at a table eating and drinking. On a
high shelf several feet away a Hollywood action film, all gunshots, car
chases, and explosions, plays on the television. Most of the tables
around him are empty. Richard is interrupted by the man he met earlier,
Daffy, who pulls up a chair beside him.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: I’m Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Richard. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Look, I’m sorry to bother you but I was
wondering if you could help me out.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Help you out?</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: I’m waiting on some money coming through.
It’s just that at the moment, you know, I’m short. They’re going to
chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m really sorry but I just arrived; I’m on
a pretty tight budget myself. I just can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Just five dollars, please. He leans in close
to Richard</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: I’ll share something with you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t lend you any money.
Daffy retreats. Richard turns back to the video and his food. Daffy
approaches two young women sitting at a nearby table.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Excuse me, ladies, is there any chance you
could help me out. I’m down on my luck at the moment. The two young
women seem uncomfortable. Richard notices.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: if you could see your way to lending me some
cash -</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Here. He leans across and holds out a ten
dollar note for Daffy.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will
repay you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Just take it, OK. Daffy takes it. Richard
returns to the video as a big yellow explosion is reflected on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>int. richard’s hotel room. night.</strong>: Some light enters
from the street through a small window. Richard lies on his bed,
watching the fan rotate above him. He is listening to the sound of
Etienne and Francoise engaging in noisy sex. They reach the climax of
their activity and fall silent. Richard just has time to enjoy the
silence when a new disturbance begins, this time from the next room in
the other direction. It is a man, Daffy, banging on the wall just above
Richard’s head and shouting in time.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Have. You. Got. Anything. To. Smoke. Have.
You. Got. Anything. To. -</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel corridor. night.</strong>: Richard knocks sharply
on the door of Daffy’s room. The door is opened immediately by Daffy,
looking even worse then before.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I don’t have anything to smoke. Daffy
stares at him for a moment. Recognition dawns.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: You. You’re the guy that lent me the
money.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. Now could you be quiet
so I can get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Ten dollars. I’ll find a way to pay you back.
How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach.
Paradise. No one else knows about it. That’s got to be worth something.
What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Look I don’t care about the money right
now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks. Richard turns away.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Richard - He turns back.</p>
<p><strong>daffy</strong>: Been nice knowing you. He sticks his hand
out. Richard politely reciprocates.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sure. They shake hands.</p>
<p><strong>int. ext. restaurant. day.</strong>: The restaurant fronts on
to the street where a new day’s activity is beginning. Richard watches
this as he eats his breakfast. He notices Etienne and Francoise sti down
at the next table.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Bonjour.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Did you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Richard looks from one to the other.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The noise? Don’t worry. You’re on
holiday.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: She means your neighbor. The Scotsman</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: We moved rooms because of him.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: He tried to borrow money from us.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: What idiot would lend him money? It would
disappear.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: He said if we lent him money h would tell
us about a secret beach.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: It’s on an island that no one get to.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: But he has been there, off course.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: It was ridiculous; all this at three
o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It would be nice though, if there was a
place like that. You know, that no one could get to.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Of course, but look; all these people. If
that place existed, they’d all be there.</p>
<p><strong>int. travel agent’s. day</strong>: On a large board are
details, photographs and prices of various standard excursions. A Thai
TRAVEL AGENT reels them off at great speed.</p>
<p><strong>travel agent</strong>: Nakhon - Pathom - Phra Ptahom Chedi -
Damnoen Sadual floating market - eight hundred baht. Kanchanburi - Erwan
national Park Phrathat Cave, huang Khamin Falls - six hundred baht. Nam
Tok, hellfire Pass, Three Pagodas, Sai Yok National Park - fifteen
hundred baht. Bang Pa In Royal Palace, Ayatthaya, Wat Phra Manhathat,
Wat Raburna - one thousand baht. What do you want? Richard studies the
board but is not excited.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Twenty Marlboro light, please. Instantly
the Travel Agent produces the packet of cigarettes from a shelf and lays
them on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>ext. khao san road. day.</strong>: Richard lights up and
looks around. He looks through the tapes at a stall.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel corridor. day</strong>: Richard walks along the
corridor towards his room, his new tape playing on his walkman. On his
door, a folded sheet of paper is attached with a pin. Richard lifts it
off and unfolds it. It is a detailed and carefully drawn map of a
cluster of islands. Some are named. One is unnamed. On it, some features
are marked; hills, forest, river and a letter X. In the corner it reads
“X = beach”. Richard switches his Walkman off. He studies the map then
walks to Daffy’s door and knocks. No reply. Richard twists the handle
and pushes gently. The door opens.</p>
<p><strong>int daffy’s room. day.</strong>: The room is dim, be even so
the blood can be seen sprayed and smeared around the walls, sheets and
floor. There is no sign of Daffy. Richard treads carefully, avoiding the
pools of blood on the floor. He reaches the other side of the room.
There, wedged in the narrow gap between bed and wall, is Daffy’s corpse.
His wrists have been cut. Richard studies the map again.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You hope and you dream, but you never
believe that something’s going to happen for you, not like it does in
the movies. And when it does, you sort of expect it to feel different.
More visceral. More real. Like IMAX maybe. I was waiting for it to hit
me, but it didn’t. And just for the record, I never did get my ten
dollars back. Richard switches his walkman back on.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station. day.</strong>: In an office, two
policemen, one in UNIFORM and the other a DETECTIVE, stand over Richard
while he signs a statement.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The police didn’t want to waste any time on
it. They were just pissed off becase he was traveling on a false
passport, name of Mr Daffy Duck, birthplace Ruritania, which kind of
fucked up all the paperwork. They pulled everyone in from the hotel, but
all they wanted form me was a statement saying I found him and it looked
like he cut his wrists. No problem. The detective studies Richard’s
passport.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: What are you doing in Thailand?
Tourist?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Traveler.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy,
ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Why not? Thai girls best in the world.
Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I wouldn’t know anything about that,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station corridor. day</strong>: The door of the
office opens and Richard walks out. Lined up in the corridor, slouching
against the walls, are several other travelers from the hotel. At the
front of the queue are Francoise and Etienne. The officer beckons
Etienne into the office and closes the door. Richard and Francoise
acknowledge each other with a smile.</p>
<p><strong>int. richard’s hotel room. day.</strong>: Richard is seated
at the top of his bed, addressing his speech out of shot while he holds
the map.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, this island may not actually exist. And
even if it does, we might not be able to get there. But look at it like
this: what else is there to do around here? Richard is alone.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So what do you think? Are you going to come
or not. I’d be thrilled if you’d join me, you and your�you and your
boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel corridor. day</strong>: Richard knocks on his
neighbors’ door. Etienne opens it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hi. You want to take a hike? I mean a trip.
A journey. With your girlfriend and me. I mean the two of you, and me.
It’s a secret island. Paradise. You know the kind of thing I’m talking
about. Francoise appears behind Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hi there. Here, take a look. He shows
Etienne the map.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s a map. The dead guy left it for me; I
think it’s the place he tried to sell you. It’s going to be just fucking
great. You want to come? I’d be thrileld if� Francoise and Etienne are
looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I realized that I had absolutely no idea of
how I was going to get there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. railway/thai countryside. night.</strong>: A train
travels at night alongside fields.</p>
<p><strong>int. train. night</strong>: Richard is awake. Opposite him,
Etienne and Francoise are slumped together in sleep.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Etienne, however, and I have to hand it to
the guy, was fucking great. He organized the whole thing: tickets,
timetables, best route, the whole damn trip.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea. day.</strong>: The bow of a passenger ferry crashes
through a wave.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boat day.</strong>: The decks are crowded with travelers
and their packs. Amongst them are Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Maps
and guidebooks are being studied by many. The noise of the engines and
the wind deters conversation.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks to him we hit the final stop on the
tourist trail inside twenty-four hours, where, Etienne assured me, we
would hire what he called a “local fisherman” to take us on the last
stage of our journey.</p>
<p><strong>int ext. truck. day</strong>: Inside back of a covered,
converted pick-up, four people are seated down each side, amongst them
Richard, Francoise, and Etienne. Behind them as they bump along, can be
seen the dusty red road bordered with dense green shrubs. The truck
stops.</p>
<p><strong>ext. road. day.</strong>: Richard unloads the final of the
three rucksacks from the roof of the truck, passing it down to Etienne
who stands at the back with Francoise. The truck pulls away, revealing
as sign, “Seashell Bungalows”.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow. day.</strong>: A simple wooden shack on
stilts, one of several standing in a line at the edge of the beach.
There is a small porch to the front.</p>
<p><strong>int. bungalow. day</strong>: A spartan room: bed, mosquito
nets, chair, cupboard, fan. Richard dumps his rucksack.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This was just the kind of place I didn’t
want to hang around. Not that it’s lacking in comfort. Quite the
opposite. It’s got everything. Everything you could possibly need to
make you feel at home. And what’s the point of that. On the beach
Francoise picks up a towel.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach restaurant. day.</strong>: The restaurant fronts
on to the beach. At the back there is a bar. Richard sits alone at a
table with a drink, watching the scene on the beach, including
Francoise. Etienne pulls up a chair and sits down. Francoise will join
them as the dialogue proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: It’s arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight
hundred baht.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nice work.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: There is one problem. Etienne opens the map
on the table.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: He will not take us to the island. It’s in
the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to
travel to this one to stay for one night.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s the wrong one.</p>
<p><strong>etinenne</strong>: I know that. Francoise sits down with a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So from there to there?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: We swim.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Swim?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: We leave our rucksacks on this island and
then we swim.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: You can swim?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you
think it is?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: One or two kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don’t like to
be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’re going to swim “one or two kilometers”
across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes
wrong. What then?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Have you told someone?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I think it’s a bad idea to tell
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard, it’s secret. That’s the whole
point.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, OK. Foreget it. We won’t tell anyone.
Richard picks up the map</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow. day</strong>: Richard sits on his veranda,
under cover. Beyond him is a tropical downpour. He hears two sets of
footsteps rushing up the stairs of the next door bungalow. Two men,
Americans, Zeph and Sammy, try to open their door but cannot.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Fuck, I knew we locked it. We should have left
it unlocked. Sammy addresses Richard</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: We lost our key</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where did you lose it?</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: On the beach. Or in the water.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: The truth is we don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You try reception?</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Closed. Back later. We hope.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Pretty annoying</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: It’s a disaster, to which there is only one
sensible, considered, appropriate, and timely response.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow. night.</strong>: All three are stoned. A joint
is passed around while Zeph sings badly.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: I smoke two joints in the morning, and I smoke
two joints at night, and I smoke two joints in the afternoon, and then I
feel alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of
war. I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then I smoke some
more. I can’t remember the rest.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Perhaps you smoked too much dope.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Not possible</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse
story?”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a
mouse. Or a rat. It’s an urban myth.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Exactly. Always happened to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: So there’s an urban myth, well more of a
rural myth, going around here at the moment. It’s about a beach.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Yea. This beach is perfect. It’s on an island,
right, hidden from the sea. Imagine: pure white sand and enough dope to
smoke all day every day for the rest of your life. Only a few know
exactly where it is and they won’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Of course no one’s actually ever met any of
these people, only met someone who has. You know what I mean. It’s a
Kentucky fried mouse.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I hadn’t heard that one before. But it’s
good. It’s a good story. A torch shines on them, jolting them into some
sort of reaction and a woman’s voice calls out.</p>
<p><strong>thai woman</strong>: Hey, you! I got your key!</p>
<p><strong>int. bungalow. day</strong>: Richard’s rucksack is packed an
by the door. Richard is sitting copying Daffy’s map on to another sheet
of paper. He finishes and writes a note on the copy. He puts the
original in his pack and lifts it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow. day.</strong>: Richard hops over the fence to
the veranda of Zeph and Sammy’s bungalow. He slips the folded copy under
their door. He looks around to check that he has not been seen.</p>
<p><strong>ext beach. day</strong>: Richard walks along a narrow wooden
pontoon, his rucksack on his back. He stops about half way along at a
small narrow wooden boat with an outboard motor. He looks down into it.
Etienne and Francoise walk past him along the pontoon without stopping
and disappear from view.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, let’s face it. There is no such thing
as a local fisherman anymore. There really isn’t the demand for them. If
you want to catch fish you put down a hundred kilometer drag net.
Richard walks away along the pontoon.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And if you want to go somewhere - you get a
taxi.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea.. day.</strong>: Richard, Francoise and Etiene sit
at the back of a small powerful motor launch which skims across the
surface of the sea with great noise and speed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: The motor launch idles gently as
it drifts into the shallows of a small deserted bay. Richard Francoise,
and Etienne jump from the boat into the shallows.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. night.</strong>: As the sun sets they sit in
silence, each shovelling down forkloads of noodles.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. night.</strong>: The only sounds are those of
crickets and the waves gently breaking on the shore. Richard is lying
asleep on the sand. He is woken by someone rummaging through the
rucksack beside him. It is Francoise, removing clothes, books,
souvenirs. Eventually she finds her camera, a mini-tripod and a
cable-release. She places them on an unfolded T-shirt on the sand.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Francoise -</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake
him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky. Richard wakes
up and works out what she is doing.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I think so too.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: One night I will get the perfect
photograph. She presses the cable release.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six. She
lets the shutter close.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Take a look. Richard leans over and
squints down the viewfinder. The sky is framed. Francoise leans into the
frame. Richard draws back.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You realize that in the eternity of space,
there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back
towards us. You’re photographing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Incredible</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There are infinite worlds out there, where
anything that can happen does happen.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: So on one you are rich, on another poor.
On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Exactly</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard, you know something - She hands
him the cable release while she adjusts the camera.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: That is just the kind of pretentious
bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so
that they can sleep with them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry. I thought I was doing quite
well.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: It’s just the sky, Richard. She presses
his thumb down on the cable release, her hand around his.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six,
sept�</p>
<p><strong>ext. night. sky.</strong>: Francoise voice fades away over an
image of the night sky. Time lapse: the sky rapidly changes to day.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When you develop an infatuation for
someone, you always find a reason to believe that this is exactly the
person for you. It doesn’t need to be a good reason, a bad one will do
just as well. Taking photographs of the night sky, for example: in the
long run that’s just the kind of dumb irritating habit that would cause
you to split up. But at the time - it’s the charming eccentricity you’ve
been searching for all these years.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: From a different beach they look
towards their target: the island. It is 1-2 kilometers away. Richard,
Etienne, and Francoise stand on the beach looking towards it. Each is in
their swimwear and a T-shirt, and carries a plastic bag, inflated and
tied, in which they carry their valuables and some rations.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: One kilometer</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know - I’m American.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We think in miles, not kilometers.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: So how many miles do you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I have no idea but it looks like a long
way.</p>
<p><strong>francoise.</strong>: Too far?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If it’s too far, then we’ll drwon. But if
we don�t’ try then we’ll never know. Richard wades into the water.,</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You have to enjoy a moment like that. You
just don’t know, you see; it may never happen again. Once more.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: SO, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I am such a fucking hero. “Let’s go”. I
felt like I’d waited all my life just to say something like that. So I
replayed it a couple of times, taking it from different
perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Multiple repeats of Richard’s
moment from various perspectives and speeds.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So: let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You have to enjoy a moment like that. You
just don’t know, you see: it may never happen again. Once more.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So: let’s go. He dives in and begins
swimming.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea. day.</strong>: They are far out to sea now, several
hundred meters from the shore. Richard swims at the front, the other two
about five meters behind.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Everyone ok?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: We’re ok.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I think we’re about half way. A few strokes
later.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard - I saw a fin!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: A fin! They all stop and tread water.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: A shark fin?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I don’t know, just a fin. Over there. About
a hundred meters.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Big?</p>
<p><strong>etienne.</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well what the fuck do you expect me to do
about it.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Nothing. I just thought you ought to
know.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather
have not known about it.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: A bit fucking late. He starts swimming
again. A few strokes later he hears a short sharp scream from
Francoise.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Francoise! Francoise! Richard turns around.
Francoise is gone. Her plastic bag bobs on the surface. Etienne is
frantic, hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: She is gone!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What happened? Etienne submerges briefly
and resurfaces.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: She just went under the water. She was
pulled under. Oh God, I don’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
They both start looking down at their feet and circling frantically in
the water.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I don’t know! I don’t know! Oh God.
Suddenly Richard screams. Francoise surfaces, pulling up his ankle. She
and Etienne laugh at Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Very funny. You Europeans, you have ssuch a
playful sense of humor. No wonder your comedy has conquered the world.
He swims on.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: What about Moliere?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fuck off. He swims on without looking
round.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: One by one the three swimmers
emerge from the sea and collapse on the beach. They are absolutely
exhausted and lie there on the sand, unable to speak. Eventually, they
tear open their plastic bags, drink some water and eat some chocolate.
Richard has a little water left in his bottle. He notices Francoise and
Etienne eyeing it enviously. He holds the bottle out towards them, then
snatches it back and swigs down the last of the water.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day.</strong>: Richard, Francoise, and Etienne
walk through the forest behind the beach.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day</strong>: They scramble up a steep slope
through dense foliage. Richard, at the front, pauses to let the other
two pass him, then he follows.</p>
<p><strong>ext. top of slope/clearing. day.</strong>: Richard reaches
the top of the slope and follows the other two through a gap in the
foliage. He joins Etienne and Francoise who are standing in awe at the
edge of a large clearing filled with cannabis plants.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Nice Island. They smile and examine the
plants. Richard wanders a short distance away. Something glinting on the
ground catches Richard’s eye. He leans down and picks it up. It is an
empty brass cartridge from a rifle. Richard looks around. Just ahead he
sees the remains of an extinguished campfire, and beyond that,
protruding from the undergrowth, a pair of male legs and beyond them,
the butt of a rifle. CLOSE IN on the nest in the undergrowth. The legs
and gun belong to a Farmer. He is asleep. His physique is strong and his
skin weathered. Richard turns back to Etienne and Francoise. They are
still strolling amongst the plants. Richard begins to back away. The
Farmer wakes. He lifts his gun and stands up to look out over the dope
field.</p>
<p><strong>ext. field. day.</strong>: There is no one there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. field. day.</strong>: The farmer looks around, sees
nobody. His attention is attracted by a whistle. He looks over. A group
of three more, similarly armed Farmers emerge from the forest at the
other side. He waves at them. They beckon him across. He sets off
through the field.</p>
<p><strong>ext. among plants. day.</strong>: The three inturders
continue to crawl along the ground between the plants Suddenly Richard
stops. The farmer’s footsteps come closer. His feet pass in the gap
between Richard and Francoise. He pauses. They lie frozen in place. He
lights a cigarette and drops the match. He moves on. They breath
again.</p>
<p><strong>ext. edge of field. day.</strong>: Richard, Etienne, and
Francoise reach the far edge of the field and enter the forest
again.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: My God, what are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Shit. This was not on the map, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I didn’t draw the map, Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: It’s a fucking mess.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I didn’t force you to come, so don’t blame
me.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: We should go back. It’s too dangerous. We
shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Go back? How? Swim perhaps? Great idea.
Back in the water? Well fuck that. You swim back if you want to. Both of
you. I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard - she is frightened. So am I.
Richard looks at them. They await his lead.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well, we’re not going back. Richard smiles.
The other two are still nervous.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Once again, I think you’ll agree. A moment
worth savoring.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day.</strong>: They flit thorugh a lest dense
forest, up a slope, looking carefully around as they go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The most satisfying aspec, of course, was
that Monseigneur Practical, Mr. Timetable, Mr
I’ll-sort-it-out-with-a-local-fisherman, he turned out to be not so hot
in your actual primordial fight or flight situation, your combat zone,
where what it takes to stay alive is quick thinking and nerves of steel.
I didn’t need to say anything. I knew it, and so did he. They reach the
top of the hill. Richard looks back. Down below they can see the dope
fields. They continue</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: If we follow this down, it should lead us
all the way to the lagoon.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s right, all the way down.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He was right. All we had to do was follow
the water and we’d be in paradise. Only I twasn’t going to be that
easy.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Well, Richard, how are we going to get
down?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Why shouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Because you can have an opinion too.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I have an opinion</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, so let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: We’ll jump.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t be stupid. Etienne?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: We’ll climb down over there.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Listen to me - we can jump.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, if we try to climb there we’ll all be
killed. Over there looks better.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Maybe we could make a rope out of some
creepers.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, or maybe we could build a hang glider
and a giant staircase.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Please! They turn to her. She is standing
with her back to the drop.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What? She turns around.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: No! She jumps. She falls towards and into
the pool. Richard and Etienne scramble to the edge and peer over. She
surfaces and waves. Richard and Etienne look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK, so we’ll jump.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Congratulation. It took me the best part of
an hour to work up the balls to do that. Mind you, I was alone, so you
have to make allowances. They say nothing.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: I’m Keaty.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Are there many people here? Keaty raises a
hand to stop Richard’s question.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: The Q and A comes later. First of all, I
think you’d better meet Sal.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day.</strong>: Sal, a woman in her early
thirties, is seated on the floor opposite Richard, Francoise, and
Etienne. Sal is studying Daffy’s map. She hands it back to Richard.
Gathered around them are about twenty assorted inhabitants of various
nationalities, all weathered travelers in their twenties or thirties.
The longhouse is single story building made from wood and bamboo
lattice, about thirty meters long. It is divided up by low partitions
into single or double sleeping areas, some of which are personalized,
others not. There is also an open area where this action takes
place.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: At first they were more interested in the
map than us. It seems that Daffy, the guy who drew it, he was a founding
father, he discovered this places and set up the community five years
ago. Then about one year ago he starts to get depressed, six months
later he leaves and that’s the last they hear till we turn up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He’s dead. He cut his wrists open in a
hotel room on the Khao San Road. The police didn’t know what to do with
the body. I guess they’ll incinerate him or something.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Do you tink he gave a mpa like this to anyone
else.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: And you, have you told anyone or shown anyone
this map?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now I’ve got to say that my first
impressions were not favorable. Oh God, I thought, it’s a tribe of
hippies. I thought we’d have to talk about our positive energies a lot,
kiss the earth every morning and recycle our waste products by some
unspeakable mechanism. Fortunately not. It really was some kind of a
paradise. We grew some fruit and some dope. The farmers on the other
side left us alone and we didn’t trespass on their turf.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day</strong>: Everyone, including Francoise,
Etiennne and Richard is sitting around a big wooden table set for
dinner. Two people are serving side dishes of vegetables and rice.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sal was the leader but it wasn’t a big
deal. There wasn’t any ideology or shit like that, it was just a beach
resort for people who don’t like beach resorts. One man begins drumming
softly on the table with his hands. Another joins in, then another. Soon
everyone is tapping out a rhythm, against the table or a bottle or a
coconut shell, using their hands or a knife or chopsticks. This is
intercut with the following scene to the point where the newcomers have
joined in and it reaches a crescendo as the main dish -a massive
complete swordfish, is served.</p>
<p><strong>ext. island scenes. day.</strong>: Various characters are
introduced in different locations; at work or at rest; speaking to
Richard or to camera. First the three Swedes.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There was the Swedes: Christo, Sten, and
Karl.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: We like fishing</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Fishing. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sten</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: And in the winter we like skiing.</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sten</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: But in Thailand - there is no skiing.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Then there were the Yugoslavian girls.</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: We are from Sarajevo.</p>
<p><strong>mirjana</strong>: Our hearts are full of loss</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m sorry. They start laughing at him</p>
<p><strong>sonja</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>mirjana</strong>: We tell everyone that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There was the Weathergirl.</p>
<p><strong>weathergirl</strong>: I feel a tightness in my pelvis; it’s
gonna rain. Heavy rain falls.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And yes, unfortunately, there was a man
with a guitar.</p>
<p><strong>guitarman</strong>: “Come as you are, as you were, and as I
want you to be�”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The only person I didn’t like was Sal’s
boyfriend, Bugs. He was one of those pricks who just won’t shut up about
all the great things they’ve seen and done, all of which are just that
little bit better, bigger, more dangerous, more extreme, more remote,
more unusual, more thi more that more fucking everything than anything
you’ve ever done.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: We were in the dessert for three weeks. It’s
forty-eight in the shade and there’s bugger all of that to speak of.
We’re on one and half liters a day; it’s practically suicide. But every
morning we’d look east and see the sunrise, and I’d thing, if I die
today - it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The local diet was pretty good and most
evenings we’d smoke some dope. Most afternoons too, as a matter of fact,
but I had a personal rule never to smoke before lunch, although as time
went on I allowed myself a certain number of - special occasions”.
Richard smokes dope.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day.</strong>: The drumming reaches its
crescendo and the swordfish is laid out.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This became our world. Pretty soon nothing
else mattered anymore: family, friend, future achievements - who cares.
Back home was just standing behind a counter all day wearing a stupid
fucking hat saying, “how can I help you sir, eat in or take away?” All
gone, all faded away. I settled in. I found my vocation.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Richard, Etienne, and Francoise
are standing in waist-deep water. Each is holding a bamboo spear. Their
hair is longer and their tans deeper than when they arrived. They are
watching Christo who stands a short distance away, spear poised for the
kill while he talks through the process.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: OK. Now you stand still. You wait. The fish
come. You wait until the fish are still. They trust you. You wait. His
speech is hypnotic, calming. His students take in the view.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: And then- He suddenly throws the spear into
the water. He lifts it out triumphant.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: You kill A dying fish wriggles on the end
of the spear.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: Now, you try. Richard, Etienne and
Francoise wade apart a little and into deeper water. They wait and
look.</p>
<p><strong>ext. underwater. day &amp; ext. surface. day.</strong>: Their
feet and legs are visible. At first nothing is happening, then a few
fish swim into view. Richard throws and misses. The other two throw and
miss.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: No, no, no. Too fast. Slowly. They pause
Richard throws. He hauls his spear from the water.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yo! A decent sized fish wriggles on the
end.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: You are a natural! They all congratulate
him. Richard raises the spear aloft.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And I say unto you: I shall provide.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. day</strong>: A bamboo spear, loaded with fish
like a giant kebab, is carried across the clearing towards the cooking
area wehre the chef and his helpers are at work. The spear is held by
richard who smiles as he deposits the fish on the broad wooden chopping
surface.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s right, I had an aptitude, a hidden
talent. All these years I’m good for nothing, turns out I’m a full-on
old fashioned hunter fucking gatherer.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day</strong>: As Richard enters there are
only a few people inside. He walks to the partitioned area and looks for
a packet of cigarettes among his possessions. Opposite to him, Keaty is
lying down, reading the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Ah, the hunter gatherer returns. Satisfied
with a good day’s killing amongst the fruits of the sea?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s me: a good day’s killing.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: God has smiled on you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He has?</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: He has made you sharp of eye and swift of
limb. In other words, you catch a lot of fish, you’ll be very popular
around here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Don�t forget to thank Him, will you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: He’d appreciate that. Anyway, first day’s
fishing, first day’s catch, you lot are just about ready to join the
community.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I thought we already had.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Not yet baptized, my son, not yet
baptized.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night</strong>: A blade burns in the fire.
Keaty lifts the knife from the fire. The entire community is assembled,
watching. He takes Etienne’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Every society must have its rituals.
They’re what binds you together, they tell you that you belong. Ours was
simple. Last one to arrive tattoos the next.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: It hurts. OK? Etienne nods. Keaty swiftly
cuts the simple symbol just below Etienne’s shoulder and smears blue
powder into the cut. Etienne winces. Keaty finishes and hands the knife
to Etienne who heats the blade briefly in the fire before he turns to
Francoise. He kisses her arm before he cuts. Francoise takes the knife.
Richard offers his arm. She grips it tightly. She hesitates. He looks
into her eyes. She cuts. He grimaces. She works on, holding his arm.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: A few candles still burn as
people prepare to turn in for the night. Richard is lying in his
sleeping area. He is watching Francoise. She is standing, visible only
from the waist up above a partition. She is inspecting her tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: All the excitement of arrival had given me
something to think about, but it wasn’t enough to displace my major
preoccupation. You can go to the most beautiful place in the world, but
the sunlight shall not bleach they passion, nor the tide wash away thy
desire. A hand. Etienne’s appears from below, beckoning her down. She
takes the hand. Just for a moment her eyes meet Richard’s and then she
lowers herself towards the ground, disappearing from view. The last
candle is extinguished.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: A game of soccer is in progress,
involving most of the population, men and woman. Etienne is playing
well. A few people, not involved in the game, are scattered along the
beach, relaxing. Amongst these are Francoise and Richard, who is
watching the game.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He’s good.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Etienne. He’s good at soccer.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Oh, I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You don’t like soccer?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No. It’s so boring.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yea, but he is good. Look. Nearly
scored.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Is that good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I think it’s good. Not that I think there’s
anything good about being good at soccer. Anyone could do that. I could
do it if I wanted to. I just don’t want to. That’s all. She sits up.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know. Just conversation.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Do you have a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Anywhere</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Just conversation.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m not jealous, if that’s what you’re
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No, it’s what you are thinking. You are
far from home. You meet a girl. It’s exciting, why not? You are
attracted to her - it’s in your eyes. Perhaps in hers as well. So you
think something might happen; it’s easy to believe, it’s exciting. But
she has a boyfriend so you are jealous. Don’t worry. It’s natural. Now I
have seen enough football. Shall we swim? Richard is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So would I be wrong?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If I thought something might happen - would
I be wrong? She touches him.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard, how would I know? I don’t know
any more than you. She walks away. Richard watches her go. He turns to
the football. Etienne scores.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And that’s all it takes. Nothing more than
a few words and the softest touch and your life is different, won’t ever
be the same again. Man dies, leaves you the mystery map to the secret
island: happens every day. But you get a smile from someone you want:
well that’s special, that’s worth the journey.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: Richard is sitting in his
bed. He is watching Francoise in conversation with Keaty across the
other side of the room. During Richards their conversation ends and
Keaty walks away, leaving Francoise momentarily alone. Most of the
population is present in the room. Sal is reading.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I would have liked to have continued our
discussion, to thrash out the details of our forthcoming affair, but
every time I had the chance to catch her alone, something always got in
the way. Francoise is alone now. Richard is about to move across when
the center of the room is occupied by commotion. At the heart of this
are Bugs, and an Italian man, Gregorio. Bugs is holding a pair of
pliers. Gregorio is in pain. Richard watches.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: I can deal with it!</p>
<p><strong>gregorio</strong>: I don’t want you to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: It won’t take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>gregorio</strong>: No! Please, no! I must go to the mainland.
Onlookers join in.</p>
<p><strong>various</strong>: No way/ You can’t go to the mainland/ No,
etc.</p>
<p><strong>gregorio</strong>: Sal! Sal looks up for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Sorry, I wasn’t really tuned in. You want to go
to the mainland? To see a dentist, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>gregorio</strong>: Yes. Sal is casual but firm.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No. It’s out of the question. She returns to
the book. With help from two or three other people, Bgs drags Gregorio
to the floor and rips out the offending tooth with a pair of pliers.
Gregorio screams.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I was sort of disturbed by this, but really
only by the method, by the way that Bugs handled it. But the guy
couldn’t leave; I could see that. When you have something secret,
everyone’s got to take responsibility to keep it that way. Francoise has
gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day</strong>: A tropical lightening storm is in
progress. At the edge of the beach, Christo, Richard, Sten, and Karl are
standing under the ineffectual shelter of a palm tree, ecah holding
their spear. A short distance away, under anotehr tree, sit Francoise
and Etienne, hand in hand. They are all contemplating the sea and the
sky. Christo has a swimming mask and a snorkel.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: In any case, I was more concerned about the
Francoise situation. After such a promising start, it just didn’t seem
to be reaching its natural conclusion. In truth it was beginning to
annoy me; I mean what’s the use of being in paradise if you can’t have
whatever you want. Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t that the whole
idea?</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: The problem is seeing the fish. With the
rain and the poor light, they are very difficult to catch. It could last
for days. Sometimes when it rains, we get hungry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, Etienne, you going fishing?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I don’t know, maybe if -</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don�t’ worry. You just sit there. I’ll go,
OK? I’ll go. You just sit there. He takes the mask and snorkel from
Christo and marches down towards the sea.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Good luck Richard looks back at them but
says nothing. He pulls the mask on and resumes his march into the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lagoon. day. and underwater. day.</strong>: Richard
swims along near the sea-bed past rocks and coral but can see no fish.
He surfaces and swims further out. He hears shouts from the shore. He
turns and treads water. The shouts from his colleagues are indistinct,
carried away by the wind and the rain.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I can’t hear. He takes the mask off to
clean the lens.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And you can’t hear me. He puts the mask
back on and turns away from the shore. He freezes. There is a shark’s
fin in the water, moving towards him. He looks around. The shore seems
far away. He starts swimming frantically towards it. The shark closes
in. Richard submerges and turns to face the shark. The shark approaches
head on. It is about five feet long with the appropriate teeth. Richard
is terrified, convinced he is about to die. The shark swoops towards him
at speed. It stops, its teeth centimeters from his mask. It pauses then
flicks its tail and swims past Richard. He is astonished. It circles him
and approaches again, pausing just in front. Tentatively, Richard raises
a hand. The shark does not react. Richard pats it gently on its snout.
It swims around him again. Richard sees small fish swimming around him.
He spears one and holds it out on the tip of his spear. The shark
snatches it off and repeats its circle but does not threaten Richard. He
smiles. As it approaches again, he holds the spear in both hands and
lowers it by his side. The shark bobs in front of him, curious and
friendly. Richard’s arms begin their forward motion as his V.O.
commences.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I ducked to one side, then to the other as
it passed me. First on my left, then on my right.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: Grilled shark steaks have
been passed around and eaten by all while Richard stands and relates his
adventure. He cannot resist a glance at Francoise, who listens with rapt
attention.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But it could see that I was getting tired,
so I stood my ground as he swam in for his final attack.</p>
<p><strong>ext. underwater. day.</strong>: Continuing the shark scene.
The shark is bobbin in front of him, practically wagging its tail.
Richard is smiling.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And at that instant, it was either the
shark or me. The shark knew it, I knew it. Richard’s arms flex. The
spear travels up. It stops. Richard grips the spear tightly as it
shakes. Blood spurts out towards Richards’ mask in pulses and the sea
turns red around him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Nothing personal, of course. It’s the way
of nature. But I swear that in the last flicker of its dying eyes there
was a moment between us, when it said -</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: Richard continues his
story.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: “Hey Richard - enjoy your dinner.” There
are cheers to the end of his story. Bugs waits until these die down.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: Strange thing, killing a shark, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Just a big fish, Bugs.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: Just a big fish? Maybe. Maybe when it’s still
a baby and it hasn’t really learned to kill yet, then maybe it’s just a
big fish. But when it’s a great white angry mother with the taste of
human blood on its tongue, well then it’s a different story. Richard
yawns noisily. Some people laugh. He notice Bugs scowling at him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry, Bugs. Is it just me or does this wet
weather make everybody tired? Maybe we can hear your “very different”
and I’m sure “very fascinating” story some other time. There is a flurry
of exaggerated yawning, sniggering, extinguishing of candles and calls
of “goodnight”. Bugs does not laugh. He stares at Richard. Richard is
smiling as he extinguishes the final candle.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: A sunny day. A game of cricket,
under the supervision of Keaty, is about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Wicketkeeper. First slip. Second slip. Gully.
Square leg. Long leg. Silly mid-off. Cover point. At low tide, two sets
of cricket stumps have been set up on the beach some twenty yards apart.
The stumps and bats have been roughly hewn. At one end, Sten stands with
a bat, ready to defend his stumps. At the other end stands Keaty, who is
umpiring. Behind them, the bowler warms up, holding a small rubber ball.
Among the ten fielders are Etienne and Francoise. Richard, the second
batsman, walks toward Keaty, practicing with an air of exuberance.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: We thank you Lord, for the twin pillars of
civilization, Christianity and cricket, even when played by those of
another faith., Amen. Ok, right arm over the wicket; first ball. The
bowler runs up and bowls. Sten hits the ball and it is fielded for no
run at leaisurly pace by Etienne. Keaty and Richard watch.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: You do realize that killing a defenseless
shark won’t make any difference.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Difference to what?</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: You and Francoise, that’s what.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry Keaty, but I don’t know what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: That is why you killed it, isn’t it? Ducked
one way then the other! All to impress her, I suppose. The second ball
is bowled and fielded.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: But you haven’t got a chance in hell. I’m not
saying you won’t get a quick fumble in her knickers down the back of the
longhouse but in the long run. Third ball</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t need to discuss this with you.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: No ball!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Also, you’re wrong. Third ball re-bowled
and hit well.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Four runs! He turns back to Richard.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Richard, you are a novelty act. He is the
main attraction.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thank you for your opinion, Father. Fourth
ball.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: I don’t mean to bring you down. I just
wouldn’t want anyone to get hurt</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If you don’t shut up, you’re the one that’s
going to get hurt. Silence</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: One other thing.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: He’s better looking than you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Thanks. Fifth ball bowled and hit. The
batsmen both run, Richard and Sten exchanging places. Richard prepares
to face the bowler</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Right arm over the wicket. One ball
remaining. The ball is bowled. Richard hits it in the air.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: Catch it! Catch it! Etienne catches it. Keaty
signals “out”. Richard walks away from the wicket, past Keaty and the
celebrating fielders, Francoise among them, who have gathered around
Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Richard reaches the fringe of the
beach where Sal is sitting alone, half watching the game.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Aren’t you going to stay and watch the
game?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. As a matter of fact, I’m going to go
for a long walk.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Don’t forget about this evening. You wouldn’t
want to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why? What happens this evening? Another
obscure English sport with which to humiliate the Americans?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It’s the anniversary, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night.</strong>: A pair of hands, Sten’s, tap
loud and fast on a small drum. The inhabitants are sitting in a group.
They are all holding half coconut shells. Sonja walks along with a large
clay bottle, filling each shell with a milky liquid. Sal is standing up.
The drumming stops.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: To the first six years. They all drink. Richard
cringes at the unpleasant taste. Beside him, Etienne proudly gulps down
the whole drink. Sonja refills the cups, pouring freely.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: And looking forward to the next one. They all
drink again. Once again, Richard sips while Etienne empties his cup.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So who was actually the first here?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Well, technically, Daffy was the first person
on the island.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So why did he leave? There is an immediate
silence.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why did Daffy leave? What made him unhappy?
The silence persists.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sorry. Have I broken a rule?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No, Richard, don’t worry. Daffy left because he
felt that in coming to paradise we had inevitably destroyed it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Because you built a shelter.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: He was a purist.</p>
<p><strong>mirjana</strong>: He was crazy. There is a general murmur of
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Must have been. The atmosphere is still
slightly awkward. Guitarman breaks the silence by plunging into a
rendition of a popular favorite. Sonja refills the cups. Once again,
Etienne tilts back his head and drinks.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: The longhouse is empty.
Outside a different, slower tune is being played. The door is kicked
open. Richard struggles in, carrying Etienne draped over his shoulder.
Francoise follows. Richard lets Etienne slide off onto his bed where he
lies, inert and comatose.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Look at him. It’s disgraceful to drink so
much.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I think he just got carried away with the
excitement of the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Don’t make excuses for him. I’m so
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now, I thought, this si my moment. It’s now
or never. Now or never. Now or -</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Francoise -</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard, would you like to go tot the
beach with me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>ext beach. night.</strong>: Richard and Francoise walk down
the shore to the moonlit sea. Francoise wades in up to her thighs.
Richard follows.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Do you like it here, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I love this island.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Do you think about home?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Nor do I. Do you think that I ignore
you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Me? No.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: It’s because I am with Etienne. It’s
difficult to spend time with you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t suppose there’s any special reason
that you should, spend time with me, that is.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Of course there is: I like you, a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And have you mentioned this to Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No. It’s our secret. They are very close
now, looking into each others’ eyes. Suddenly Francoise looks away.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Look! The plankton. Shrimps. In the dark,
when they are disturbed, they glow. She dives in. He follows.</p>
<p><strong>underwater. night.</strong>: Their faces, close together, are
illuminated by the phosphorescent plankton.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. night.</strong>: They surface, kissing
passionately.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. day.</strong>: Under a shelter in the cooking
area, the Chef walks up to two sacks of rice and slashes them open. He
picks out two clumps of green, rotten mush and holds them out towards
Sal who stands nearby.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. day</strong>: The inhabitants of the community
are sprawled around the area, generally facing towards Sal who addresses
them. Francoise is sitting with Etienne but turns to acknowledge Richard
with a smile at some stage.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Alright, I’ve got some bad news. As some of you
may have heard, a couple of sacks of rice have gone rotten. Now this is
not a disaster -</p>
<p><strong>various</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yes, that’s right: I need a volunteer to go to
Ko Pha Ngan with me to buy some rice. So please don’t all volunteer at
once. There are no volunteers. Everyone avoids Sal’s eye.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Keaty?</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: I went two months ago.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: And so did I. Anyone else? Still no
volunteers.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Richard? Richard has been scrutinizing
Francoise’s back.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: What about you? Will you come to Ko Pha Ngan
with me?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sure. Yea. I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Great. She smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day</strong>: Richard is sitting on his mat
with a pencil and a piece of paper. A line of people wait to pass him
some crumpled baht and their order. Their recitals overlap.</p>
<p><strong>man 1</strong>: Toothbrush, toothpaste, sixty cigarettes, a
new hat, some elastoplast, a pair of swimming trunks, four bars of
chocolate and some razors.</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: One hundred aspirin, one hundred
paracetamol, six boxes of regular tampons, toothpaste, soap and some
shampoo.</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: Toothpaste, a ball of string, four double-A
batteries, and twenty condoms. No, make it forty.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: Six bars of chocolate, moisturizer, four
boxes of tampons, assorted sixes, two bars of soap and some
toothpaste.</p>
<p><strong>man 3</strong>: One tin of beef curry.</p>
<p><strong>woman 3</strong>: A newspaper, some boiled sweets, shampoo
and conditioner, two hundred cigarettes, a pair of plastic sandals,
small, a new swimsuit, size ten, bright but no flowers, a plain T-shirt,
a jar of Vegemite and three cigarette lighters. The last to sit down
opposite Richard is Bugs. He sits close, their knees almost touching.
Richard is posed with his pen, ready to take note.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anything I can do for you? Bugs smiles. His
right arm whips out and he grabs Richard by the testicles. Richard
buckles forward in pain.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: Yeah. When you get to Ko Pha Ngan, keep your
hands to yourself and your dick in your pants. He releases Richard.
Preplexed and in pain Richard watches Bugs walk away.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: Everyone is asleep. Track
along past the sleeping forms to stop at Richard. The figure looking
down at him is Sal.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. dawn.</strong>: Sal and Richard are walking
away from the longhouse in the early morning light. Sal has a small
parcel of cannabis wrapped up in a plastic bag.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Why are we leaving so early.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: If you hang around, people take advantage of
you, give you orders for all sorts of shit - clothes, condoms, Vegemite
and God knows what else.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: We go to Ko Pha Ngan, sell the dope, buy the
rice, and come back. That’s all. EXT. BEACH / Water. Day. Sal walks into
the water and begins swimming out towards the cliff. Richard watches
then dives into the water.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lagoon / cliffs. day.</strong>: Sal waits for Richard as
he catches up with her at the base of the cliffs inside the lagoon.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Over?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Under.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anything I should know?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Don’t breathe till you get to the other side.
Sal submerges. Richard watches her disappear into an underwater tunnel
into the rock. He takes a deep breath.,</p>
<p><strong>underwater. day.</strong>: Richard enters the tunnel, passing
from the light into the dark. He enters near total darkness. Far ahead
is a narrow point of dim light. He swims towards it.</p>
<p><strong>int cave. day.</strong>: Richard surfaces, breathing deeply.
He is in a cave within the cliffs, from which a small entrance opens on
to the sea beyond. Within the cave is a large flat rock and moored
beside that is a small narrow boat with an outboard motor. The ceiling
of the cave is high and opening into it is a chimney . Additional light
enters through this. As Richard surfaces, Sal is already in the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Welcome to the garage. She pulls the start
cord. The small engine’s loud roar reverberates around the stone
walls.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea / cliffs. day.</strong>: The small boat emerges from
the cave on to the sea, Richard at the front and Sal at the helm.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. night.</strong>: By the light of the moon, they
come to land on a deserted stretch of beach. Richard jumps into the
shallows as Sal cuts the engine. Lights dance in the sky some distance
away. Sal and Richard drag and shove the boat up the beach. The full
moon shines brightly. The insistent beat of dance music is heard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: All the way I was sort of looking forward
to the party, but when we actually got there -</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach resort. night.</strong>: The street is lined with
bars each pumping out western music on its own sound system. Richard and
Sal walk along the strip. They turn towards a bungalow complex. Sal is
still carrying the parcel of dope.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: - I couldn’t be bothered. It all seemed
kind of trashy and out of place. This was why we kept the secret. If
these assholes ever found out about our island they’d take just one
night to spoil it forever.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalows reception. night.</strong>: The reception area
is covered by an awning. An old warped pool table stands in the center.
Sal and the receptionist, SUMET, greet each other and speak in Thai.
There are no subtitles but when they discus sthe number of rooms they
indicate with their fingers: this is not seen by Richard.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>sumet</strong>: Good evening, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Very well, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sumet</strong>: You brought something?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: As always. Sal puts the parcel on the desk.
Sumet weighs it in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>sumet</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: We’d like to stay one night.</p>
<p><strong>sumet</strong>: Two rooms?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: One. Sumet looks at Richard.</p>
<p><strong>sumet</strong>: A good choice. Young and strong. She squeezes
his arm and laughs.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: She says she’s got two rooms. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>int. phone booth. night.</strong>: Richard is in one of a
line of booths in an international call office/general tourist
store.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know. I just don’t know. Maybe this
year, maybe not. I like it here. Things are different out here.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I phoned home and discovered that I
couldn’t communicate. I realized that I was no longer the person they
knew.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You don’t understand. He hangs up. He steps
out of the booth. On the other side of the store are racks of patterned
shirts and hats. Richard walks across and stares just beyond them. He is
looking in a mirror, at himself, tanned and weathere-beaten.</p>
<p><strong>int.supermarket. night.</strong>: Richard browses, selecting
the items on his list, then spending time choosing soap, eventually
opting for a brand marked “Genuine French Soap”.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: In fact the more I thought about it the
more I realized that none of this world made any sense to me. I’d left
it behind. We all had, and in its place we’d found somewhere special,
and we were determined to keep it that way. He drops the “French” soap
in his basket.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. night.</strong>: The music is far away now.
Richard and Sal struggle along the deserted beach to their boat carrying
a pallet laden with sacks of rice. They arrive and drop the pallet.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now I understand why no one wants to come
for the rice.</p>
<p><strong>int/ ext. bar. night.</strong>: The bar opens out to a street
just back from the beach. It is busy. Sal and Richard stand at the bar
with their drinks.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: So how does it feel to be back in the
world?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s not like I remembered it.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It gets worse every time. A hand rests on
Richard’s shoulder, gently pushing him aside to create space at the bar.
It is Zeph.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Excuse me, please. He does not see Richard’s
face but concentrates on the barman. Richard recognizes him and conceals
his face.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Excuse me! Four beers please. Heinneken. The
barman serves him. Sammy and two German girls stand behind Zeph. He
passes the drink back to them and turns to speak. Richard and Sal listen
in.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: OK, where was I?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: The beach.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Right, the beach: it’s on this secret island,
in the middle of the national park where no one is allowed to go. It’s
paradise.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: Sounds cool.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: What’s even better is we got the map of how to
get there.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: Can we see it?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Sure. Let’s go back to our place. We can
smoke some dope, drink some beer, loosen off these tight clothes we’re
wearing, then check out the map.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: But hey it’s secret - if we show you the map,
you have to come with us. They laugh. Zeph and Sammy high-five each
other.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Back in a minute. Just going to conduct a
recon of the local sanitation facility. Richard watches him leave the
bar.</p>
<p><strong>ext. toilet. night.</strong>: The toilet is a narrow concrete
passage with a ditch along the bottom on one side. There is no roof but
a single light above. Zeph is just finishing as he notices Richard.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Hey, Richard! I hardly fucking recognize you.
Where have you been? The beach? Tell me - it’s paradise.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There is no beach.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The map is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: You’ve been?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No. it’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Danger - hey, you’re calling my middle name.
What kind of danger?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: I think you’re trying to put me off.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m just telling you, for your own good:
stay away. Don’t go. Don’t even try. Just forget it.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: We’ll do whatever we want. He goes to leave.
Richard places a hand on his chest. They stop for a moment. Zeph pushes
the hand away.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Fuck you. Zeph walks past then turns back.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Stay away from the mushrooms, Richard, they
make you paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bech / steps. night.</strong>: Richard and Sal are
climbing the steps towards the bungalow reception.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: That idiot Daffy? What was he doing - handing
out Xerox copies to every asshole in Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, it’s unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Why? That’s all I want to know. Why?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know, Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Pardon me for this, but thank Christ he’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalows reception. night.</strong>: Richard and Sal
enter from the steps. Behind them the party is still in progress. Sal
approaches the desk while Richard hangs back. She greets Sumet who hands
over one key.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Bad news.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: She gave away your room. She thought we were -
you know - together. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Right. Great. Well I’ll go find somewhere
else then. I’ll meet you back here in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Richard. She shows him the key for the room.
They look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m going to play a couple of games of pool
with Sumet. She throws the key. He catches.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Why don’t you go warm the bed?</p>
<p><strong>int. bungalow. night.</strong>: The room is in darkness.
Moonlight penetrates the threadbare curtain. The bed is surrounded by a
mosquito net. The music from the beach party is audible. Just visible
through the net is the outline of two human forms entwined.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow. night.</strong>: Lizards scuttle across the
small porch.</p>
<p><strong>int. bed. night.</strong>: Surrounded by a wall of mosquito
net, Richard and Sal lie on the bed. Sal lies on her side falling
asleep. Richard is awake.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It was great.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, it’s not that. I just wondered about
Bugs. And me. Sal rouses herself.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: OK, it’s like this. Bugs is my boyfriend, my
partner, and you, you’re someone I just screwed. Is that ok? She turns
on her side again.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s fine. That’s absolutely fine.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good, now get some sleep - I may wish to have
sex again before we eat breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Richard and Sal push the boat into
the water and away from the beach, jumping on board as they do so.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea/cliffs. day.</strong>: Richard and Sal approach the
outer cliffs of the sea-wall in the boat. Richard looks up. Bugs is
standing at the top of the cliff, directly above the cave.</p>
<p><strong>int cave. day.</strong>: The sacks of rice are now contained
in a net being hauled upwards on a rope towards and into the chimney
which rises out of the ceiling. Sal swims away into the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cliff top. day.</strong>: Bugs and Keaty haul the rice
up with the aid of a block and tackle.</p>
<p><strong>int. cave. day.</strong>: Richard is alone as he looks up the
chimney and watches the cargo disappear the last few feet to the top of
the cliff. As it reaches the top it is swung aside and Bugs looks down.
Richard and Bugs stare at each other down the length of the chimney.
Richard casually clutches his groin and thrusts once.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Screwing Sal was pretty good but screwing
Bugs - that was even better.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: The longhouse is full of
inhabitants. Richard walks the length of the hut like Santa Claus
despensing toiletries and other gifts as requested. He reaches Francoise
alone at the end of the hut. He gives her the “French” soap.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I missed you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The rice run? No problem.</p>
<p><strong>farncoise</strong>: I mean being with Sal?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh�fine. Listen, do you want to go to the
beach?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I can’t. Meet me tomorrow morning. Ten
o’clock at the waterfall. She touches him as she walks away.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I didn�t’ feel as bad as I should have
about all this. In fact I didn’t really feel bad at all. What happened
on Ko Pha Ngan was different, it didn’t count.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And I was glad to be back. Now I really did
understand why no one wanted to go for the rice. Life here was so good
that going back to the world we came from could only bring you down. He
reaches the area by the waterfall and stands waiting. He looks around
for Francoise: no sign. He checks his watch: a few minutes to ten.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Hi there, Richard. Richard turns to see Sal,
who has appeared as though from nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, Sal. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Hi? Is that all you can say? I thought we had a
little more rapport than that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I mean, hello, nice to see you. What brings
you here.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I was looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh. Well, here I am.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I have to go somewhere. I’d like you to
accompany me. Richard checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Right now? It’s not really all that
convenient, Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m sorry. Are you meeting someone?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Me? No.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good. So, you can come with me. � �</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: If they reach the island, I want you to
discourage them from getting any further.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: “Discourage.”</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You’ll think of something, Richard. I trust
you. Sal kisses him on the cheak and leaves. Richard watches her go.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sal! How long do I - Sal! She does not turn
around. Richard turns back towards the other island. He focuses the
binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: The empty beach on the other
island.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hilltop. day.</strong>: Richard is not pleased.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She didn’t tell me how long I was supposed
to wait or anything. You know what she’s like, she just gets you to do
things.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Just things, you know.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, what’s wrong - I’m sorry I wasn’t
there today. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I think Sal is attracted to you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: On Ko Pha Ngan, did anything happen?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Happen? No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: You promise.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Good. They kiss.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ok, so I lied. It just wasn’t the right
time.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hilltop. day.</strong>: Richard sits at the lookout.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And the next day, we couldn’t meet up
either. It was straight back up. Same scene again: no travelers, no
boat, no action, nothing. Now I thought if this is going to be a regulra
situation, I’m going to have to start hiding from Sal so I don’t have to
come up here. But a strange thing happened: I began to enjoy it. I
looked forward to it, I started to explore.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hill. day.</strong>: From a vantage point, Richard looks
down on the lagoon, the beach, the forest, and the clearing. With the
binoculars he can see the details of life in each of these areas.</p>
<p><strong>ext. island scenes. day.</strong>: Through the binoculars,
various characters are at work or at rest including Francoise, Etienne,
Sal, Bugs, Keaty, etc.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And then I couldn’t understand why I’d
never come up before. I got a whole new perspective. They were ants, or
rats in an experiment, but up here I wasn’t part of it, I was free. I
could do whatever I wanted. This was my personal adventure playground.
There was even a bunch of local bad guys I could fool around with.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest near dope field. day.</strong>: Looking through
the trees, the four dope farmers are visible about thirty meters away,
relaxing and playing cards. Richard appears in a tree, hiding from their
view, if they cared to look. He steals forward to another tree. He
watches them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Pretty soon, I was starring in my very own
war movie. It was Vietnam 1968, or at least about as close to it as I
would ever get, considering I was born in 1973. But I knew exactly who I
was: renegade special forces officer on a solo mission, search and
destroy. I liked the sound of it “he prefers to work alone,” they’d say,
“he’s got the stare.” The farmers are oblivious. Richard advances as far
as he dare: a few meters from them. He peers at them around the edge of
the tree. He notices that the one nearest has left a knife on the
ground. Richard lifts a stone and throws it high in the air beyond the
farmers. As it falls through the trees to the forest floor the farmers
are startled. They stand and turn away towards the noise reaching for
their guns, cocking them, etc. The knife is taken by Richard. The
farmers see a bird fly from a tree. Satisfied, they give up and return
to their resting place. Richard steals away from tree to tree. The
farmer cannot understand where his knife has gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day</strong>: Richard sits in a hollow under a
rough shelter he as made from palm leaves. He is using the knife to gut
a bird of some sort which he then eats raw.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I hadn’t entirely forgotten my purpose up
here, but I wasn’t worried about it. I mean I didn’t want one of those
bastards turning up with my map sticking out of his pocket, but if they
did, it was going to be a challenge. It was a mission, my mission, to
defend our island.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hilltop. day.</strong>: Richard watches the empty
beach.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The only hitch was - the enemy didn’t show
up. Now it was probably a mistake, but I one day I brought Francoise up.
I thought I’d show her around.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day</strong>: Richard struggles through dense
undergrowth, followed by Francoise.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on, just through here. Watch out for
the thorns. Here: look. Beneath a tree, a few rotting logs are topped
off with palm leaves.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s a shelter. I built it. I thought we
could move up here. Get away from it all.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. You’ll need to tell Etienne, of
course but -</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard, it’s horrible.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Primitive, yes, but you have to accept some
limitation when you go for seclusion like this.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: And to eat?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Whatever I kill, we’ll eat. Francoise
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Enjoy yourself, Richard. I’ll see you
later, back in civilizatin.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do you want a mushroom?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They grow here, all over the place. I
picked some. Here. Richard collects a handful from under the shelter.
Francoise does not think this is funny.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Please yourself. He swallows one. Francoise
turns away. She struggles back through the undergrowth. Richard watches
her. He swallows a handful of mushrooms.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day.</strong>: Close up: a caterpillar crawls
along a green leaf. Richard, his pupils dilated, is watching,
transfixed. He holds the knife at the end of the leaf. The caterpillar
crawls on to the blade. Richard sticks his tongue out and swivels the
blade around. The caterpillar crawls on to his tongue. Richard gently
closes his mouth. He swallows.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When you’re a highly trained combat
machine, you can’t allow yourself to be distracted by minor problems in
your personal life. And you can’t sit around, you have to stay active,
otherwise your energy will dissipate. You have to feed the fear.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night/dawn.</strong>: Richard, his face
disrupted by mud, sneaks towards the rough shelter of wooden planks and
palm leaves under which the four farmers are sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>int. ext. shelter. night/dawn.</strong>: The shelter is
several meters long but shallow and is open down the length of one side.
This is the farmers’ home on the island. It contains a collection of
tools, arms, crates, bedding, food, cigarettes, and bottles of cheap
whiskey. Spaced out within the shelter, the four farmers are asleep on
low pallets or mats on the ground, each with their gun by their side.
Richard enters the shelter and surveys the scene. He approaches the
nearest farmer who lies asleep. He is wearing a bandana which has
slipped half off in his sleep. Very slowly, Richard reaches down and
lifts the farmer’s gun, a Kalashnikov-type assult rifle. Richard holds
the weapon, becoming comfortable with it. He lifts the butt to his
shoulder and squints down the sight. He closes in on the farmer, so
close that the muzzle is almost tickling the farmer’s nose. In his
sleep, the farmer swats at his nose as he might swat at a fly. Richard
withdraws the gun a fraction. His finger strokes the trigger. He moves
very carefully around the shelter, pointing the gun at each sleeping
farmer and mouthing “bang” as he goes. He returns to the first farmer
and kneels beside him. The farmer is on his side, facing away from
Richard. He stirs in his sleep and wakes slightly. He reaches out behind
him to feel for his gun. His hand feels the metal. He relaxes and closes
his eyes again. Behind him, Richard smiles and releases his own grip on
the gun. Instead he lifts the bandana away from the farmer’s head and
puts it on his own. Now he produces the knife from the back of his
shorts. He kneels beside the farmer and holds the knife firmly. Abruptly
he stabs it into the upright wooden plank behind the farmer’s head. The
blade sinks deep into the wood.</p>
<p><strong>ext. waterfall. day.</strong>: Richard screams as he executes
an exhibition dive from the top of the waterfall to the pool below.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: There is no one on the beach apart
from Richard. He walks to the water and dives in. He surfaces and faces
the sun.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I was ecstatic. In a fair contest I had
infiltrated their command and left my mark. I had fulfilled my potential
as a warrior, a soldier, a killer on the loose. I could just imagine
them trying to work how the missing knife got home. Christo, Sten, and
Karl appear walking down the beach with their fishing gear as Richard
walks in from the water.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hi, guys.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: Hello Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I couldn’t wait to tell Francoise about
it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day.</strong>: Richard’s face is slapped twice
by Francoise’s hand. They are standing in a small clearing not far from
the longhouse. Francoise raises her hand to slap him again. He retreats
a fraction.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do you want to calm down? I’m trying to
tell you about something exciting. I’m trying to share it with you and
all you can do is freak out because you don’t like where I want to
live.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I don’t care about that.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No? Still pissed about the mushrooms. You
know Francoise, sometimes you are so uptight.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: You liked to me. About Sal.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, that. She told you?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: She told everyone. She believes in
openness and honesty, not like you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on, you were two-timing Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Because I liked you. I didn’t know you
were going to screw Sal twenty-four hours later.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well if you’re going to make such a big
deal out of it -</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Bugs is going to kill you. And you know
what - I don’t care. She raises her hand and slaps him again. Richard
does not flinch.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day.</strong>: Richard enters the longhouse.
Inside are several people, including Bugs, sitting at the far end. When
they see that it is Richard, all conversation stops. One by one at
first, then en masse, everyone except Bugs leaves the longhouse,
hurrying past Richard at the door. Richard and Bugs stare at each other
down the length of the longhouse. Richard smiles. He repeats the gesture
that he made when returning with the rice: he clutches his groin and
thrusts towards Bugs. Bugs starts running towards Richard. Just as Bugs
reaches him he takes evasive action, feinting to one side. Bugs,
cursing, pursues Richard around the longhouse, each of them trampling
over possessions and partitions. Bugs is bigger but Richard is too sly
and nimble for him, taunting and mocking as he dodges around the narrow
upright supports that run down the middle of the building. Eventually
Bugs has Richard cornered. They face each other, crouched slightly,
breathing heavily. From outside a loud, horrified screaming begins. It
carries on and on.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Don’t you think we ought to go see what the
problem is? Bugs pauses for a moment. He glances towards the door for a
fraction of a second. Richard slugs him in the jaw.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. day.</strong>: Richard emerges from the
longhouse, flexing the fingers of his punching hand. A crowd has
gathered as he joins it. At the center are Karl, on his knees, wailing
and shouting in Swedish, and Sten, who has been savaged by a shark and
looks dead. Despite his appearance, Keaty and Gregorio are attempting to
resuscitate him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Poor Karl: he didn’t speak much English,
but he only needed one</p>
<p><strong>karl</strong>: Shark! Shark!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They were trying to save Sten’s life
although even as a novice in this field I could tell that just wasn’t
going to happen. Richard backs away.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Richard walks along the shore and
begins to follow a bloodstained furrow in the sand.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The way I saw it, sharks live in the sea,
so if you go swimming where they live, they might eat you. That’s what
sharks are good at, that’s what they do. I could have explained this to
Christo but I just knew he wouldn’t see it. Richard is standing over
Christo who is lying in agony on the sand.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: Richard! My foot. My foot! It’s so painful.
My foot! Richard looks at Christo’s right leg: it has been bitten off
beneath the knee, leaving only a ragged bloody stump.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, your foot - it’s - pretty bad.
Christo clings to him.</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: But it will be ok? Please Richard, when I
get to the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>christo</strong>: Tell me - it will be ok.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Christo, it’ll be ok.</p>
<p><strong>ext. grave stie. day.</strong>: A freshly dug grave in sandy
soil about 1.5 meters deep. The corpse in a sleeping bag is slung into
the grave, its feet protruding from the end. Immediately, the earth
starts to be filled in from either side.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: We are gathered here today to pay our last
respects to Sten. I couldn’t claim to know the bloke all that well but
what I knew, I liked. He was a straightforward, easy to get along with,
reliable sort of guy. He worked hard for the whole community - he even
lost his life fishing for us. Keaty is addressing the entire community
beside the grave while earth is heaped on.</p>
<p><strong>keaty</strong>: He made an effort to join in whatever was
going on. For example, he played cricket with an aptitude and enthusiasm
that belied his Nordic origins, and I think we can see that as a
symbolic ofhis place amongst us in a wider sense. Anyway, he wasn’t one
for long speeches, and neither am I. May God take you soul, and you
shall rest forever in peace mate. We’ll miss you. Keaty holds back a
tear as he throws a flower in the grave. Others throw flowers in. Bugs
hammers a wooden cross into the ground behind the grave.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. day.</strong>: Christo is being nursed by
Etienne who is mopping his brow, trying to get him to drink etc. Several
people are sitting around, inactive and silent. Christo moans. A couple
of people get up and leave.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: After the funeral we all tried to get back
to normal, but it just didn’t seem right. After a while it became clear
that the problem was Christo. You see, in a shark attack, or any other
major tragedy I guess, the important thing is to get eaten and die, in
which case there’s a funeral and someone makes a speech and everyone
cries and says what a good guy you were, or: get better in which case
everyone can forget about it. It’s the hanging around in between that
really pisses people off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. day.</strong>: Etienne is backing through the
forest. Outraged.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: This is disgusting! You cannot do this!
Take him back! A party of stretcher bearers, including Bugs, Sal, and
Keaty, carry Christo through the forest. Sal is carrying a small rolled
up tent. Richard walks behind.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Ok, that’s far enough. They lower Christo to
the ground.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Take him back, you fucking animals! Sal
drops the tent at Etienne’s feet. The part walks away apart from
Richard</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Fucking bastards!</p>
<p><strong>int. small tent. day.</strong>: Christo, delirious, is being
nursed by Etienne in the small tent, now situated in the middle of the
forest. Richard is with him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s not that they don’t care, Etienne,
it’s just that they don’t care in the same way as you do. It’s a fine
distinction, I know.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: I understand: they wish he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No! they’ve be equally happy if he
recovered. They just want an outcome.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: He needs a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You worked in a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: For one month, as a cleaner, a
domestic.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Well that’s one month longer than anyone
else around here. Look, you’re doing your best for the guy. No one could
ask for more. Everyone apprecaites that.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Look, Richard! Etienne draws back the sheet
covering Christo’s discolored stump. Richard recoils.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: It’s gangrene. It’s spreading. He needs an
amputation. Etienne produces a knife from his possessions.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re going to do it here?</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Where else?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: OK! I’ll hold him still. Etienne prepares
to proceed, but at the last moment he cannot. He drops the knife Richard
relaxes.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: People are playing and relaxing on
the beach and in the water, shouting and swimming.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It would be a lot easier to condemn our
behavior if it hadn’t been so effective, but out of sight really was out
of mind. The bad smell was gone - it was like we had amputated Christo
from our community and after the operation was over, we felt a whole lot
better.</p>
<p><strong>underwater. day.</strong>: In water one meter deep, moving
forward with a smooth side-to-side action, the POV of some underwater
creature. Small fish scatter ahead of it. Suddenly a pair of legs come
into view: they are Francoise’. Close right in on them at speed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sea. day.</strong>: Francoise screams as Richard
surfaces beside her, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Just when you thought it was safe to go
back in the water.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, relax, just a joke. What’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: No, what’s wrong with you? Why didn’t you
stop them moving Christo?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Francoise I just thought we ought to spend
some time together. We haven’t had a chance to talk, and let’s face it,
it’s going to be a lot easier for us to do that if Etienne isn’t hanging
around the longhouse.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I don’t believe it. You really think it
was alright to move him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He was getting everyone down.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: I don’t know what has happened to you,
Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I like it here! That’s what happened! So
what’s the problem? Francoise turns and walks away. Richard calls after
her sarcastically.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We do still have something going don’t we?
She does not reply.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So, it seemed that Francoise and I were
finished. Under other circumstances I might have got depressed about a
think like that, but I had something else to occupy my mind.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: Seen through binoculars, Zeph
walks along the beach on the other island. He is carrying a large piece
of driftwood. He turns away from the water and walks up the beach
towards the line of palm trees. There he joins Sammy and the two German
girls who are constructing something from driftwood and polystryrene
floats.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night.</strong>: Richard is sitting with
Sal.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They’re building a raft. It’s nearly
finished.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: When did they get there?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I don’t know. Sometime during all that
shark shit.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Well you’ll have to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They won’t get beyond the DMZ.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The demilitarized zone, Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Right. You call it what you want, Richard, just
don’t let them get this far.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They won’t. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: This is a particularly bad time, with Christo
lying in that tent, it wouldn’t look good if anyone arrived.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. dawn.</strong>: In the small tent, a torch
glows, outlining Etienne and Francoise over the prone form of Christo.
Francoise emerges from the tent. Richard watches.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. dawn</strong>: On the upper part of the island
Richard ascends rapidly beside the stream.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hilltop. dawn.</strong>: Richard surveys the beach on
the other island.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. dawn.</strong>: Through binoculars. Zeph, Sammy,
and the German girls launch their raft. It floats. They climb on and
begin paddling.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest near dope field. day.</strong>: Richard flits
thorough the trees until he can see the shore.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach. day.</strong>: The travelers on their raft come
ashore. They consult their map then move into the forest.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest near dope field. day.</strong>: Richard watches
them as they ascend the slope to the dope field. In the other direction,
hidden from the travelers perspective, he notices the four farmers
sitting at their shelter eating breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>ext. field. day.</strong>: The travelers, watched by Richard,
reach the top of the slope and then the edge of the field. The farmers
are nearby.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: If I was going to warn them, then now was
the time to do it. All I had to do was walk out and tell them not to
make any noise I could lead them to safety. I could persuade them to go.
I could threaten them. If the worst came to the worst, I could lead them
to the camp and we could kick the shit out of them, then send them home.
But I didn’t want to do any of those things. I wanted to see what would
happen. Zeph, Sammy, and the German girls are jubilant.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: We are in dope heaven. There is no other
explanation.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: I smoke two joints in the morning. I smoke two
joints at night. I smoke two joints in the afternoon and then I feel
alright. I smoke two joints in time of peace and two in time of war. I
smoke two joints before I smoke two joints and then - Zeph stops
singing. He has seen the farmers, armed and watching him from a few
meters away. Sammy and the others also notice, one by one. They too
stand still, dumb and frightened.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: We’re Americans. Tourists. But we will leave.
We made a mistake. We go now. We take nothing. Slowly, he begins to walk
backwards, smiling reassuringly. The farmers say nothing but advance and
outflank the travelers, herding them back into a huddle.</p>
<p><strong>zeph</strong>: We go now. We leave in peace. Look we can pay.
Here, American dollars. You can have them. The farmers line up opposite
them. All begin to plead desperately for their lives. One of the German
girls suddenly breaks away and starts running in the direction of
Richard’s hiding place. One of the guards shoots at her repeatedly,
missing. The others start shooting at the remaining three, cutting them
down in a hail of bullets. The German girl keeps on running, zigzagging
as she goes. The farmers fire but miss. She reaches the place where
Richard is hiding, couched down in the undergrowth. Startled by seeing
him, she stops abruptly. Richard and the German girl stare into each
other’s eyes for a moment. Suddenly her chest explodes forwards as a
single bullet rips through from her back. She falls to the ground.
Richard is spattered in her blood. He sits motionless, staring at her
corpse.</p>
<p><strong>underwater. day.</strong>: In the pool at the base of the
waterfall. It is empty. Richard appears, submerging at the speed from
his jump. He sinks then floats slowly towards the surface, eyes
open.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pool. day.</strong>: Richard climbs from the pool.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: So that was it. Now I knew exactly what
would happen. I wouldn’t need to wonder aobut it any longer.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night.</strong>: Richard walks across the
deserted clearing towards the light of the longhouse. Around him, a wind
begins to blow.</p>
<p><strong>int. loonghouse. night.</strong>: The longhouse is full.
Everyone is there, apart from Etienne and Francoise, engaged in quiet
conversation. Richard is hardly noticed as he sits down. A few seconds
later, Sal sits opposite him. She is absolutely matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: All of them?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, all of them. They disturbed the
farmers.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I guess that means we don’t need to worry
about them any more.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yeah. The only problem we have left is
Francoise and Etienne. Richard realizes what she means.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You knew they’d be killed.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It’s not the first time.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And Daffy?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Daffy. He saw it happen. Didn’t he? Yea, he
saw it happen. And now you wanted me to see it happen.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Richard, if you’re going to live here, you’ve
got to get involved. Richard’s knife is lying beside him. Sal picks it
up by the tip of the blade.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Francoise. And Etienne. She slaps the knife
into Richard’s hand. She stands up and walks away. Richard contemplates
the knife.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night.</strong>: A storm is building up,
scattering anything loose across the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: Most of the lights are out
now. The wind is beginning to rattle the building. Richard lies
awake.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I wasn’t thinking about what she asked me
to do.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel corridor. day.</strong>: Richard and Daffy shake
hands.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I was trying to remember somewhere I used
to call home, someone I used to be, but I couldn’t put a name to that
place or a face to that person anymore - they got left behind in a hotel
room in the Khao San Road along with a man who cut his wrists.</p>
<p><strong>int. daffy’s room. day.</strong>: Richard steps carefully
across the floor, avoiding the pools of blood.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: But at least I understood why he’d done
it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. night.</strong>: It is pouring rain and the
storm grows stronger. Richard appears alone in the clearing, the knife
in his hadn. Thunder and lightening begin.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I still didn’t know what I was going to do
when I got to them. You see, when you have blood on your hands, you ask
yourself, what difference will it make if you spill some more? I had
made a sacrifice to keep the secret, and now that sacrifice was the
secret.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Richard approaches the faint
glow of the small tent where Francoise is nursing christo. He is
carrying the knife. He crawls close up to the tent. Etienne is sleeping
in the open doorway.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse night.</strong>: Inside there is darkness
while all are sleeping. The thunder is directly overhead and the
lightening flashes frequently. Sonja stirs in her sleep. In a flash of
lightening she thinks she sees something. A whole series of flashes
provide a clearer view. At the end of her bed four corpses, Zeph, Sammy,
and the two German girls, hang upside down and bound together from the
central beam in the roof of the building. Zeph appears to be staring at
her, his hair trailing against her feet. She screams. More lightening
illuminates the four armed Farmers.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Richard crawls towards the
sleeping Etienne. Inside the tent, Francoise has her back to the
entrance as she mops the brow of Christo, feverish and unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: The farmers have torches
now. One of them is interrogating Sal angrily in Thai while the other
inhabitants cower at gunpoint.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You draw maps! You bring people here!
Why?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No, we don’t. We bring no one.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: You are lying! You are bringing people here.
Too many people! He hits her with the rifle butt.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No, I promise, we keep it secret. We tell no
one. He hits her again.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Then who drew this? He holds out the map
drawn by Richard.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Richard draws closer to
Etienne. He reaches him, the knife poised in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>int. longhouse. night.</strong>: The four bodies hang from
the roof. The farmers have gone. Sal lies injured on the floor. The
inhabitants silently pass the map from one to the other. It reaches Bugs
last. He studies it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Richard’s bald is at Etienne’s
throat. He opens his eyes, frozen with fear. Richard is aware of a gaze
from another direction. Keeping the knife at Etienne’s throat, he turns
to see that Francoise is looking at him. They stare at each other.
Richard takes the knife away.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You have to leave. Do you understand? You
have to leave right now. If you don’t they’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: What about Christo?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There is nothing more you can do. I’ll look
after him.</p>
<p><strong>francoise</strong>: Richard -</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You don’t have time to talk about this. You
have to go now. Christo moans. Etienne looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Leave him with me. Etienne understands. He
and Richard stare at each other.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Bugs runs through the forest,
away from the lights of the clearing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest. night.</strong>: Francoise and Etienne flee
through the forest towards the beach.</p>
<p><strong>int. small tent. night.</strong>: Richard studies Christo,
illuminated by a torch. His breathing is labored and irregular. Richard
reaches forward. He pinches Christo’s nose and covers his Christo’s body

off the torch.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lagoon. night.</strong>: Richard swims out from the
beach.</p>
<p><strong>ext. lagoon/cliffs. night.</strong>: Richard swims out
towards the cliff. He reaches the cliff and pauses, taking a deep breath
before submerging towards the underwater tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>int. cave. night.</strong>: Moonlight reflects in through the
chimney and the entrance. Etienne and Francoise are in the boat. Etienne
is trying to start the boat. He sees the silhouette of a man surface and
crawl onto the flat rock. Etienne steps off the boat onto the rock as
the figure in the shadows approaches him.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard, come one, get into the boat. The
man pulls Etienne forward and stabs him deep into his abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>etienne</strong>: Richard! It is Bugs.</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong>: Richard can’t help you now, French boy.
Francoise screams. Bugs releases Etienne who falls helpless to his
knees. Bugs turns his attention to Francoise. She pulls the start cord
and the engine starts. Bugs holds one end of the mooring rope, pulling
the boat towards him while Francoise tries to undo the other end.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, Bugs! Richard stands on the rock. Bugs
turns towards him. He drops the rope and walks a couple of paces, then
rushes him. Richard manages to avoid the blade. They fight. Bugs forces
Richard on to the ground He is about to stab Richard. Etienne appears
behind Bugs, struggling on his feet, bleeding from his wound. He is
holding a piece of rope. He slings it around Bug’s neck. Etienne’s eyes
roll and his head lolls. He falls back into the water, pulling Bugs with
him.</p>
<p><strong>underwater. night.</strong>: Etienne and the struggling Bugs
sink. Bugs cannot free himslf, becoming only more entangled.</p>

the sea bed.</p>

to die. I had to live with myself.</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room. day.</strong>: In a typical Khao San Road
hotel. The room is a mess. Richard disheveled and haggard is sitting at
a small table, working with a pencil and a piece of paper.</p>

suppose I ever will. I’ve been here six months now.</p>
<p><strong>ext. clearing. day.</strong>: The clearing is deserted and
overgrown. The longhouse is derelict and overrun with creepers.</p>
<p><strong>ext. island. day.</strong>: From above in one rising shot,
the beach, the lagoon, and the island.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Listening to all the people talk about
where they’re going to go and ho great it’s going to be, and I try to
tell them: you can go too far, you can find out too much, but no one
ever listens, no one ever listens. I guess there’s some things you just
have to discover for yourself.</p>

room. He looks back once and closes the door. Close on The Map.</p>
