<p><strong>voice</strong>: Bleichert! Bleichert!</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I already knew him by reputation, had
our respective records down pat: Lee Blanchard, 43-4-2 as a heavyweight,
formerly a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium.</p>
<p><strong>lee blanchard</strong>: Code three, Bleichert!</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: And he knew me, Bucky Bleichert, light-
heavy, 36-0-0, ranked tenth by Ring magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
opponents in no-man’s-land division.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: To the halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You come all the way down here to roust–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I came all the way down here same as you did.
Keep from gettin’ killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin’ on a
good collar– Habla Ingles, Tomas?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Tom here’s my ninth hard felon of the month.
Six weeks he’ll be sucking gas. In three years I’ll be working Central
Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters.
Promised me the next spot he can wangle.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Wanna hear something more impressive? My first
twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager. My girlfriend
saw you fight a couple times over at the Olympic. Says maybe you could
take me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Whatta we do about the Mex?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: We’ll take ’em in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You’ll take him.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: He’s half yours, partner.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’s all yours. And I’m not your partner.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Someday.</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: Yep, three years in the Canal Zone. Nothin’
but skeeter bites and drunk fights over three-dollar skank tail…</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: …fights over three-dollar skank tail…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Somethin’ up, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You, that’s what. You know Lee Blanchard over
at Central Warrants?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: His partner’s toppin’ his twenty and goin’ for
early retirement. Word is the felony D.A.’s lookin’ for a bright boy to
fill the spot. Christ knows why but it’s down to you and Johnny Vogel
for the spot.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: His old man Fritzie’s a Central Dick.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: But who’d look better when they bring back the
boxing team, eh Buckaroo?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Warrants was local celebrity as a cop.
Warrants was plainclothes without a coat and tie, romance and a mileage
per diem on your civilian car. Warrants was going after the real bad
guys and not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of the Midnight
Mission.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I told myself I didn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Officer Bleichert.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert. Bucky, Chief Thad
Green, Deputy DA Ellis Loew.</p>
<p><strong>chief green</strong>: Read this aloud, Officer. It’s running
in Sunday’s Times.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: “Before the war, the City of the Angels was
graced with two local fighters, born and raised a scant five miles
apart, pugilists with styles as different as fire and ice. Lee Blanchard
was a bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger–</p>
<p><strong>chief green</strong>: Skip down to the fire and ice part.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: “Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each
other, but a sense of duty brought them together in spirit, and both
joined the Los Angeles Police Department.” Blanchard cracked the
baffling Boulevard-Citizens bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos; Bleichert served with distinction during
the ’43 Zoot Suit Wars–”</p>
<p><strong>chief green</strong>: Skip to the end.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: “Both men made great sacrifices to serve
their city, and on Election Day, voters are going to be asked to do the
same thing–vote on a five million dollar bond proposal to upgrade the
LAPD’s equipment and provide for an eight percent pay raise for all
personnel. Keep in mind the examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice. Vote”Yes”
on Proposition B.”</p>
<p><strong>chief green</strong>: Whattya think?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Subtle.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Prop. B’s looking like a loser right
now. But if we can drum up some publicity we may he able to get it
passed in the ’47 Special. We need to build up morale in the department.
Impress voters with the quality of our men. Wholesome white boxers are a
big draw, Bleichert. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Fire and Ice.</p>
<p><strong>loew</strong>: Ten rounds. The Academy Gym. Three weeks from
now. Right before the election. All the gate to charity. After that, we
bring back the interdivisional boxing team. Wholesome fighters.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Wholesome.</p>
<p><strong>chief green</strong>: Are you in, Bucky?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It’s not like you’ll last the ten rounds
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>loew</strong>: I’m betting on great things from you,
Bleichert. And if I don’t miss my bet we may be colleagues soon.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Uh, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bucky I’d like you to meet Kay Lake.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: I saw you fight a couple times. You won.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I always won. You a fight fan?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Lee used to drag me. I was taking somme art
classes so I’d sketch the boxers.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn’t want
me doin’ the “vegetable shuffle.”</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’ll try not to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Sure make Loew happy.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’s got money on me, I gather?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Seems that way.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And if I win I get Warrants?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Seems that way.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What do you think of all this, Miss Lake?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: For moral reasons I hope the LAPD gets
ridiculed for perpetrating this farce. For financial reasons I hope Lee
wins. And for aesthetic reasons I hope you both look good with your
shirts off.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Luck short of winning.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Luck, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: The 77th Street lieutenant tapped as
official LAPD bookmaker had Lee as an early 3 to 1 favorite…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Papa?</p>
<p><strong>dolph</strong>: Guten tag, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Speak English, papa.</p>
<p><strong>dolph</strong>: Englisch Schiesser! Amerikan Schiesser!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Say something, Papa. Get me mad. Tell me how
you can fuck this place up so bad in one month.</p>
<p><strong>dolph</strong>: Du, Dwight? Du?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Speak…English. Papa, please.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: …He’s had another stroke. If you could just
come by and clean the place up and keep an eye on him for week or so…a
hundred dollars is fine. No more than ten days. I promise. I do. Thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: He was better than I thought. It made
what came next easier.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: So…I’m surprised but I’m not so surprised. I
hear you been lookin’ good. Better’n people think.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m not bettin’ on me, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Oh. Then as a friend I feel it’s my duty to
tell you this: you better make it look good.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Knockout between rounds eight and ten.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Dragna’s got a guy really sold on you. Even
money. Best you’re gonna get.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thanks, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Luck.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Short of winning?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Luck.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I’d almost finished the Police Academy
when the background check turned up my father’s German-American Bund
membership. Pressured by the FBI goons to confirm my patriotism, I gave
the Alien Squad Sam Murakawa, a guy I’d grown up with, in order to
secure my LAPD appointment.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: The old fuck never knew any better.
Never knew what he cost me. Or Sammy, who’d died at Manzanar. I was a
good fit in the snitch’s jacket and with a little alteration I slipped
easily into the whole suit.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: At least he looks good with his shirt off.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Where’s your sketch pad?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I was never very good. Ended up with a degree
in History. Masters. Lee’s fight money paid for it.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Education’s an expensive habit to kick. He
shouldn’t have quit fighting.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I asked him to. Besides, catching animals gave
him a sense of order. You have a girlfriend, Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Saving myself for Rita Hayworth.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’re not getting married if that’s what you’re
wondering.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why not? Shacking’s against the regs.
Probably cost him a stripe.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I have to go, Dwight. Good luck tomorrow
night.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You didn’t answer my question–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Lee and I don’t sleep together, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: With no lead on the two escaped men, the
heist quickly went from page one to page five. Two weeks later…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: One of Lee’s snitches fingered Bobby
DeWitt, a greasy little pimp with a yard long rap, as the brains behind
the bank job.</p>
<p><strong>back to present</strong>: Bucky walks through downtown L.A.,
hands stuffed in his pockets like James Dean…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’ll catch on soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Hey. Canvasback!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You gonna hide in there another week? Ain’t you
bored yet?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Gettin’ there.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Wanna work Warrants with me?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Harrell’s been callin’ to tell you. You been
hibernating–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: But I lost. Loew’s deal–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t you read the papers? The bond issue
passed yesterday. Want the job, partner?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Mister Fire. Mister Ice. The hero and
the snitch.</p>
<p><strong>tierney</strong>: Officer Bleichert, the men of Central
Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera. I’m Captain Jack Tierney.
You and Lee are the white men of the hour, so I hope you enjoyed your
ovation. You won’t get another one until you retire.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Russ Millard, homicides. Wife and kids
thank you for the raise, Officer.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Y-y-y-yes. Th-th-thanks Officer B-B-
Bleichert.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Officer Bleichert. Welcome to Central
Warrants–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: The proposition passed, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Yes but some of your patron’s lost
money. Play things smarter here. Don’t blow this like you blew the
fight.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Ready to roll, canvasback?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why’d you really quit fighting?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Benny Siegel bought out my contract, scared off
my manager. Said he’d get me a shot at Joe Louis if I’d take two dives
for him. I said no, joined the Department ’cuz Jew syndicate boys won’t
kill cops. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: One more. What are we doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: While you were dancing with Ellis at muster I
checked Maynard Coleman’s KA’s on the bulletin and recognized the name
of a fence. Think he tends bar here…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bruno Albanese?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Police officers, Bruno. Let’s make this fast so
I don’t have to watch you eat.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Never seen ’em before.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Versailles apartments. Sixth and
St. Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Right there!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Police officer. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Let go of him! Let go of him!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Let go a my daddy! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: They got here fast. The confession.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: He confessed. Kiddie porks and the
burglaries. Fritzie says we’re all getting commendations.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Ellis loves the kid angle.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You talk to Ellis?</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: He’s only “Ellis” to lieutenants on up,
Blanchard.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Least I don’t call him “kike”.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: C’mon, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Play nice. Hm.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Shitbirds.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Russ says good collar today.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You like pot roast?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Don’t say anything to Kay about DeWitt. It’ll
upset her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You takin’ bribes, partner?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Fight stash.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hello, Dwight. Glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: Fairy tale come true, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hm?</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: The house. You and Lee partners. Fairy
tale.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Can’t say I believe in fairy tales.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Then you’ve never really had to. Lucky man.
Lee! Dinner!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: A toast…To Proposition B!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: To the Bleichert/Blanchard rematch! Bigger
than Louis/Schmeling!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: To fairy tales!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: To…us!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Goin’ into politics, Ellis? Give us a quote.
“The only thing to fear is fear itself.”</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Here’s the man to fear.</p>
<p><strong>raymond “junior” nash</strong>: Statutory raps, armed
robbery, felony mayhem…Texas State Prison…Alcatraz…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Give us the good news. He’s in LA and actin’
uppity?</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Witnesses made him at a stickup near
Leimert Park over the weekend. Pistol- whipped an old lady. She died
about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Anything common in the sex beefs?</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Negro girls. Young ones. All the
complainants have been colored.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Seeya in Leimert Park.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Sergeant Blanchard? Try not to kill the
man. I’d like to do it in court.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: From November through the New Year, Lee
and I captured a total of eleven hard felons, eighteen traffic
warrantees and three parole and probation absconders…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: After tours of duty, Lee and I would go
to the house and find Kay. Sometimes she made dinner for us, other times
the three of us would go dancing, or see a flick.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: This grand tour stuff’s for shit. I’m callin’
in some favors.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Got a tip. Snitch a mine says he’s shacking
with some poon in a crib near Slauson and Hoover.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s all colored down there–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: We fuckin’ roll.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Hopheads. Let’s shake ’em for an address or a
name.</p>
<p><strong>white hophead</strong>: What the—Blanchard?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Shut up, shitbird.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Partner!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bucky duck!</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Thank you for your time, Officer. And
your police work, as well.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He knew one of the guys. Baxter Fitch. Busted
him once for loitering. Sort of liked the guy.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Oh baby. Oh babe.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Leave me alone! You’ll never fucking
understand–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He knew one of the guys.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Bobby DeWitt gets out in a week, Dwight. We’re
on edge. He swore at the trial he was going to kill Lee.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: We can take care of Bobby DeWitt.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Lee’s scared. You don’t know Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I know as much as I need to know.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Rise and shine partner!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lee? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Sure. Ran Mulholland at a hundred and ten.
Played house with Kay all day yesterday. Feel like doing some police
work?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Junior Nash’s got a fuck pad on Norton and
Coliseum.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Okie trash.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lee.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Is that Millard and Sears?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Before this gets out of hand let’s put
the kibosh on something. If this gets a lot of publicity we’re going to
get a lot of confessions. So we keep some things quiet. This girl was
disemboweled. You keep this information to yourselves. Not your wives,
not your girlfriends, no other officers.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Nash is renting a room in that building over
there.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Blood on the premises?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No. This isn’t him.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: The lab’ll be the judge of that.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hey. Junior Nash, remember?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: He didn’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No. He beat an old woman to death. That’s why
he’s our priority warrantee.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: This ain’t ours, partner–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It is now, partner.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Have you heard female screams…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: …anyone discarding women’s clothing?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …seen anyone in the lot on 39th…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: …and what about this man?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You were supposed to meet me at the fights
tonight, remember?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Priority. Remember.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Priority for the Bureau. Not for us.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Nice white girl gets snuffed. Gotta show the
voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue. It’s a showcase.
It’s A-plus, Buck. We don’t miss this.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: We’ve had enough headlines for the week.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: With or without you, partner.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Confessors.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: He didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Blanchard?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: In with Loew. And reporters.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: …and the heinous nature of this killing
makes it imperative to catch this fiend as soon as possible. A number of
specially trained officers, including Mr. Fire and his partner
Mr. Ice…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You got us detached?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Slow and easy, Bucky. First I gave Loew a memo
saying Nash blew our jurisdiction–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It’s all right. The APB still stands. We’ve got
the pad staked. He’s covered.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Jesus, Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: On gross pathology, we have a female
Caucasian between sixteen and thirty. Cadaver is presented in two halves
with bisection level with the umbilicus.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Is it…all right to smoke, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: She’s not going to mind.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Questions?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: What’s your best guess?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Here’s what she wasn’t. She wasn’t raped,
she wasn’t pregnant, dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within
the last week…She took what I’d call a gentle whipping in the last ten
days…In terms of the nitty-gritty…She was probably tortured with a knife
for thirty- six to forty-eight hours before death. The cause of which is
either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with
something like a baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What about her insides?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: They came out after death. Then I’d say he
drained the blood from the body and washed it clean, probably in a
bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Did the guy know anything about medicine or
anatomy?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Maybe. Probably not a surgeon type–but that
doesn’t rule out veterinary training, biological training, or my
Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA. Has she got a name yet?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Elizabeth Short.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: God love you, Elizabeth. Russell, when you
get the son of a bitch who did this to her, give him a kick in the balls
and tell him it’s from Frederick D. Newbarr, M.D. Now all of you get out
of here, I’ve got a date with a jumper suicide in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>captain jack</strong>: Cops popped her in ’43. Santa Barbara.
Underage drinking. Other than that she’s clean. Four sisters. Parents
divorced. Father’s here in LA. Hear he sold some old portrait photos of
her to the Herald.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: How many confessions so far?</p>
<p><strong>captain jack</strong>: Eighteen.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Double that by morning. More if Loew
got the press excited with his purple prose.</p>
<p><strong>loew</strong>: I’d say my prose fits the crime,
Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Too much publicity is a hindrance,
Ellis. If you were a policeman you’d know that.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Captain have you sent men to talk to the
victim’s father?</p>
<p><strong>captain jack</strong>: Not yet, Ellis.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: How about Vogel and Koenig?</p>
<p><strong>captain jack</strong>: Aaah, Russ, who do you think we should
send?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Cops, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m Detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This is
Sergeant Blanchard. We’d like to express our condolences for the loss of
your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: I know who you are. Neither of you’da
lasted a round with Gentleman Jim Jeffries. As for Betty, c’est la vie.
She called the tune, she paid the piper. You wanna hear my alibi?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Since you’re so anxious to tell it.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Johnny on the spot at my job. Twenty-
seven straight hours. Refrigerator repairman. Twenty-seven straight and
the last seventeen overtime. Call my boss. He’ll alibi me up tighter
than a popcorn fart, and that’s air tight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: When was the last time you saw your
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Betty came west in ’43 with stars in her
eyes. I promised her three squares and a five-spot if she kept the house
tidy.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Was that soldier her boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: They were all her boyfriends! Not so
ugly and wearing a uniform, can’t go wrong there. Betty believed in
quantity before quality.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You calling your own daughter a tramp?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Got five daughters. One bad apple ain’t
so bad.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Any names, Mr. Short?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Tom, Dick, Harry. Don’t matter. Said she
was looking for movie work but…just paraded the Boulevard in those black
get-ups of hers.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Jesus fuck. We just got handed the entire U.S.
Armed forces as suspects.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Flip to see who writes it up?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m staking Nash’s pad for the night. See if we
get any strange drive-bys at the murder sight. Do me a favor and drop in
on Kay. She’s worried about me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: She’s a smart woman.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hi, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How’d you know it was me?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Lee stomps, you tread lightly.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lee’s–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Let me guess…Lee’s up all night– probably on
Benzedrine again–working that poor girl’s murder–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re worried about him. And he’s worried
about me. But who’s worried about you? Is that left for me?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No need for that.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: For such a cautious man you’re quite a
hardcase.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s just…He’s done a lot for me.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Found it in storage down at the
railway. Carbons of mash notes to sailors. Hundreds of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Thank our friend Bevo Means at the
Herald. Bevo’s painting Betty and her black dress like some actress in
that Alan Ladd movie, The Blue Dahlia. Should triple our
confessions.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I think I want to go back to Warrants.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: No dice. You’re a bright penny and I
want you here. Betty’s last known residences and KA’s. Go to University
Station and pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie’s sick. Keep Bill on a tight
leash, and you write the report because Billy’s practically
illiterate.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lieutenant–</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Call me Russ and get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How do you want to play this, Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Fritzie usually does the talking and I stand
back up. Muscle job?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Let’s try talk job.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Miss Saddon?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You the driver from RKO?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Police.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: If this is about those jaywalking–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s about Elizabeth Short.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I did all this on the phone this morning.
Nine thousand questions about Betty’s nine thousand boyfriends and I
don’t remember any of the names. Can I go now? The extras truck is due
any minute.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How about you sit dawn and answer my
questions or I bust you for the reefer you flushed.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: That’s Betty’s other place. DeLongpre and
Orange.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: She moved around quite a bit. You know why?
Was somebody threatening her?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Betty’s problem wasn’t enemies. It was too
many friends.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’ve gathered that. Let’s change the
subject.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: How ’bout “the world of high finance”?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m in mister.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Congratulations. What about Betty?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Maybe once. Maybe not. ‘Round Thanksgiving
she showed up bragging about gettin’ her big break…Had one of those
viewfinders around her neck? But who knows where she really got it.
Betty had a tendency to–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: …stretch the truth?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Lie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your ride’s here–</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: What’d the cooze say ’bout me?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I’m bored.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: This’ll just take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: I’m gonna take those two guys outside. Maybe
they knew the cooze–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’ll handle ’em Sarge–</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: No! I’m gonna do it! Now what do I roust ’em
about?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I dunno. Ask ’em anything. Alibis. See if
Betty ever engaged in prostitution…</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: …Betty had this gift, you see. She was so
sweet and eager to please…a bit dumb, maybe. But she’d do anything to be
liked, become whatever you wanted her to be. She’d walk like you, or
talk like you…but she wasn’t…she was still her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Did she ever tell you she was in a movie?
Sometime around November?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Sure. She had this viewfinder and showed
it around to all the guys. Said it was from the director. A co-starring
role.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Did she say what it was?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Once she said it was for Fox. Another time
Paramount. I think she was just fibbing. You know, for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Do you remember the names of any of the
guys?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Don and Harold–sitting outside. She dated
both of ’em once or twice. Other than that…I just…didn’t really pay
attention to who she was with.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What is it? You can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Well…Right before she moved out…l saw her
and Linda…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Linda Martin?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: Yeah. Her and Linda Martin–talking to this
older woman up on the Boulevard. She had a man’s suit and short hair
like a man…Only that one time…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Are you saying the woman was a lesbian?</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: Them guys talked. Said the stiff peddled her
twat when she got strapped bad. I called it in. Mr. Loew said to keep it
zipped cuz it don’t look as good.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Take their statements, Bill. I’ve got a
little more here.</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: That’s her. God…She’s only fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lorna Martikova. Omaha, Nebraska. Runaway.
When’d you see her last?</p>
<p><strong>marjorie</strong>: This morning. I told her I’d called the
police to come talk to us about Betty. Was that the wrong thing to
do?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You couldn’t have known.</p>
<p><strong>koenig</strong>: They didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No shit Sherlock.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Your name please?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Elizabeth Short. Betty.
Beth…Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Relax, Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Sorry. Can we try it again?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We haven’t even started yet.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I used a Warrant cops special
prerogative and issued an APB on Lorna Martikova aka Linda Martin. I
wrote up my day’s report, omitting Marjorie Graham’s lead on the old
dyke. I didn’t need Ellis Loew quashing it along with the skinny on
Betty as the part-time prostie.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Hi, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: It ain’t a random job. Horseshit. Guy who did
this…hated her. Bad. Wanted the whole goddamn world to know. Babe, you
took pre-Med, whattya think? Mad doctor?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Lee, Dwight’s here.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Oh, hey partner. Bucky listen to Kay. Babe’s
got ideas. Good stuff–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: This kind of theorizing’s nonsense, but I’ll
give you a theory if you’ll eat something to calm yourself down.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Theory on, teach.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Well. Just a guess. But maybe there were two
killers. Because the torture cuts are crude, while the bisection and the
cut on the abdomen are neat and clean…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Lee’s face, somehow both intense and
unfocused…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Three days ’til Bobby De Witt hit LA.
Three days since we killed four men.</p>
<p><strong>back on</strong>: BUCKY, who turns on his heels and exits,
catching Kay’s eye as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>a wager pool sign-up list posted on the wall</strong>: a
crude felt craps table with various betting spaces: “Solved–2 to 1”,
“Random Sex Job–4 to 1”, “Uhsolved–Even Money”, “Boyfriend–l to 4”…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Administrative Vice Squad?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Beverage Control?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: LAPD Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Who got snuffed?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Seen either of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Huh. The Dahlia’s a sister?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Never seen her ’cept in the papers. And
the little schoolgirl twist I’ve never seen. We don’t truck with
underaged stuff. Capice?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Capice when your girls tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Black Dahlia.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What about this girl?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Never seen her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Don’t you fuckin’ lie to me. She’s fifteen
fucking years old. So you come clean or I slap a contributing beef on
you, and you spend the next five years servin’ raisinjack to bulldykes
in Tehachapi.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: A couple times. Two, three months ago.
Just to cadge drinks off the sisters, though. She liked boys, I’m sure.
And not the Dahlia. Never.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: We interrupt our regular broadcast to
bring you a bulletin. A major suspect in the investigation of Elizabeth
Short, the raven-haired beauty known as the Black Dahlia, has been
captured! Red Manley, a Huntington Park hardware salesman and one of the
last men to be seen with the Dahlia, was captured early this morning.
Currently being held at Hollenback Station–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Dahlia left San Diego six days before we found
her. Dago cops got a witness puts her in a tan Dodge with a partial
plate ident. Finally got a cross-check that matched on Red here.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: Like I said, Robert. We’re doing this
because you didn’t come forward.</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I’ve told it three times now. I didn’t
want my wife to know I was chipping her.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: But you said you didn’t chip on her. Betty
wouldn’t put out. That’s no reason to hide from the police.</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I dated her down in Dago. I slow-danced
with her. It’s the same thing as chipping.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: And you wanted to fuck her, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I wanted…to test my loyalty to my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: Come on, son!</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I wanted to fuck her. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: But she cock-teased you.</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: She said she had her period–</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: Said the father of her child would be a
combat veteran–</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: And you were in the Army band. You get
angry?</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I told you. I didn’t kill her.</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: You drove her back to LA with you
on…December tenth? And dropped her at the Biltmore Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I’ve told it how many ways? How many
more ways do you went to hear it?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Welcome back to earth, partner.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Your fault, really. After you left Kay slipped
me a Mickey. Slept for seventeen hours.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your fault for buying her all those chemistry
classes.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Learn anything interesting?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Now you’ll see why Russ keeps Harry around.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Russ’s only rule. No actual hitting.</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: You wanted some fresh gash, and you
thought Betty was easy. You came on strong and that didn’t work. You
offered her money. She told you she was on the rag, and that was the
final straw. You wanted to make her bleed for real–</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No no no. Not Betty–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: You plied Betty with drinks, got her to
talk about her old boyfriends and came on like a pal, like the nice
little corporal willing to leave Betty to the real men, the men who saw
combat–</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: You took her to a toolshed, maybe one
of those abandoned warehouses out by the old Ford plant in Pico-Rivera.
There was some twine and lots of cutting tools lying around, and you got
a hard-on…</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No no no–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: Yes, Reddy, yes. You thought of every
girl who said “I don’t suck”, every time your mommy spanked you, every
evil eye you got from real soldiers when you played your trombone in the
army band.</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: That’s what Betty had to pay for wasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: No, please! God as my witness!</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: God hates liars!</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: I didn’t hurt her–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: Tell God!</p>
<p><strong>red manley</strong>: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Good report yesterday, Bleichert.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: What next?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You send me back to Warrants?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Wrong again. But keep going.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Canvass around the Biltmore. If Red dropped
her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last
days before she got snatched.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bright penny. You’re doing well,
Bucky. Run with the ball.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: All I know is you should keep an eye on Loew
and his boys. I didn’t put it in my report, but Betty sold it outright
when she needed money bad enough, and Loew’s been trying to keep it
kiboshed so it’ll look better if he ever takes it to trial.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You calling your boss an evidence
suppressor?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And a grandstanding son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You’re a brighter penny than I
thought. Betty sightings. Wilshire Division. I need smart pennies to
eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: Keep an eye on the evidence suppressor son
of a bitch and his minions to make sure they don’t try to coerce a
confession out of that innocent man in the holding tank.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Barflies. Daytime juicers…The longer I
listened the more they talked about themselves, interweaving their sad
tales with the Black Dahlia, who they actually believed to be a
glamorous siren headed for Hollywood stardom…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: It’s sick and it’s insane! After everything…And
all that might happen–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I need this, babe. You know it. I’ll rent a
room for the stuff but– You tell her Bucky. Reason with her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: She’s right, Lee. You’ve pulled at least
three misdemeanors here. It’s out of control–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Dwight, you can be so gutless sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Slumming, Miss Sprague?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I am now. Daddy spying on me again?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m a policeman.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Well that’s a new one–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: This is all a fluke. I met them at
LaVerne’s last fall. Betty maybe one time. Linda a couple. She’d come in
to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You sleep with either of them?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: No. Just cocktail lounge chitchat.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Are you lez?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Ye might say I take it where I can find
it, laddie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why’d you rabbit last night?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Mister, my father is Emmett Sprague. The
Emmett Sprague. He built half of Hollywood and Long Beach, and what he
didn’t build he bought. Imagine the headlines. “Tycoon’s Daughter
Questioned in Black Dahlia Case–Played Footsie with Dead Girl at Lesbian
Nightclub”. Get the picture?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: In Technicolor. What did you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Linda talked about her boring boy back in
Hicktown, Nebraska, or wherever. Betty talked about the latest issue of
Screen World. Hollywood dreams, the sad nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Betty ever tell you about a movie she did?
Show you a viewfinder? Anything specific?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: On a conversational level they were right
down there with you, only they were better looking.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You’re cute.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You’re not. Look, I’m tired. You want to
hear my alibi so I can end this farce and go home?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: That’s all anyone ever wants to volunteer:
the alibi. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: My family and I were at our house in
Laguna from Sunday through Thursday along with our live-in servants. If
you want verification, call Daddy. But be discreet about where we
met.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I don’t need your cash if that’s what you’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Ah, Laddie…’S not what I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Convince me.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Tomorrow night. Eight o’clock. My address
is 482 So. Muirfield.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I know the address.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Not surprised. Pick me up. Like a
gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Bucky Bleichert.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’ll try to remember.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yes, ma’am. I understand. A werewolf and Red
Manley. Oh no. The werewolf is Red Manley. Yes that would be more
efficient…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So…You smooth things with Kay?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Yeah. I rented a room for the stuff at the El
Nido Motel. Nine scoots a week. Chump change if it makes her feel
good.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: De Witt gets out tomorrow, Lee. I was
thinking maybe I should lean on him. Get Fritz Vogel and Koenig to do
it–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Blanchard. Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Bleichert. Homicide.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I logged forty-six phone tips, about
half of which were reasonably coherent. Lee left early, dodging any talk
about De Witt. Ellis Loew stuck me with writing up the summary report,
most of which concerned the numerous dead end leads, bogus confessions
and three hundred new Dahlia sightings per day. It left me gut certain
of one thing:</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Boston. Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: How long have you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Two years.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: You’ve lost your accent.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Well, you know, when in Rome… Why?
Do you want a girl with an accent?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Look. I hate to pull this, but Daddy has
heard about you. He insisted you stay for dinner. I told him we met at
that art exhibit at Stanley Rose’s Bookshop, so if you have to pump
everybody for my alibi, be subtle. All right?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: That’s Balto. The paper is the LA Times
for August 1, 1926. Balto was bringing in the paper when Daddy’s
accountant told him he’d made his first million. Daddy wanted to
consecrate the moment so he shot him. Here we go–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bucky Bleichert. May I present my family.
My mother, Ramona Cathcart Sprague. My father, Emmett Sprague. My
sister, Martha McConville Sprague.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: A pleasure, Mr. Sprague.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez. Boxed
the pants off him. Another Billy Conn you were.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Mondo gave a good show. What ever
happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Died of a heroin overdose.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Too bad. Shamed his family. Speaking
of families–</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Madeleine says nice things about you.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Daddy can we eat? Bucky and I want to
catch a nine-thirty show.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Dig in, lad. Hearty fare breeds
hearty people. Haute cuisine breeds degenerates.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I want to draw Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: You’re in for a cruel caricaturing,
Bucky. Maddy’s my pretty one, but Martha’s my certified genius.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: German.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: A great people, the Germans. Hitler
was a bit excessive, but mark my words that someday we’ll regret not
joining forces with him to fight the Reds. I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you meet Balto out in the hallway?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Very realistic.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: An old friend stuffed him. We were
in the Scots regiment together. Georgie Tilden. He wanted to work in the
flickers.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So when did you come here?</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: 1920. Hollywood was a cow pasture,
but the silent flickers was booming. Georgie got work as a lighting man,
and me building houses. Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett and I
helped him build that housing project he was putting up–Hollywoodland–
underneath that godawful sign.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I always loved the Keystone Kops.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Old Mack knew how to squeeze a
dollar dry, he did. He had extras moonlighting as laborers and vice
versa. I used to drive ’em over to Hollywoodland after twelve hours on a
Keystone Cops flicker and put in another six hours by torchlight. Even
gave me as assistant director credit a couple times, so grateful he was
for the way I squeezed his slaves–</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Did you know, Mr. Bleichert, that Ramona
Boulevard was named after me?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No Mrs. Sprague, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: When Emmett married me for my father’s money
he promised my family that he would use his influence with the City
Zoning Board to have a street named after me. But all he could manage
was a dead-end block in a red light district in Lincoln Heights. Are you
familiar with the neighborhood, Mr. Bleichert?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I grew up there.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Then you know that the Mexican prostitutes
expose themselves out of windows to attract customers. I hear many of
them know Mr. Sprague by name–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Mr. Bleichert?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’m so…sorry. Don’t hate my family–
don’t–they’re not so bad–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Not them, me. Do me. Be with me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Well. I think you kept your name out of the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Until we announce the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your mother would love that.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: She’s a hypocrite. She takes pills the
doctor gives her, so she’s not a hophead. You know how Daddy really made
his money?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: He bought rotten lumber and abandoned
movie facades from Mack Sennett and built houses out of them. He’s got
firetraps all over LA registered to phony corporations…His “good friend”
George? Disfigured in a car crash while running Daddy some errands.
Daddy throws him scraps now–odd jobs tending some rental property–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You don’t have to tell me this–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I want to. I like you Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I like you, too.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bucky, I didn’t tell you all about Betty
Short.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Jesus–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Don’t be mad at me. It’s nothing. I just
don’t want to lie to you.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Last summer I was bar-hopping a lot.
Straight bars. I heard about a girl who looked like me. I got curious
and left notes at a couple places: “Your lookalike wants to meet you”,
things like that. I left my number. She called. That’s how I met her at
LaVerne’s with Linda.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And that’s all of it?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes. That’s all of it.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Then be prepared, babe. There’s fifty cops
out there combing every bar in town looking for Dahlia info. You could
be headed for the papers no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Serve my family right.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You don’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: No. I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Tell me something. Why’d you want to meet
Betty Short?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’ve worked pretty hard to be loose and
free. But the way people described Betty. It sounded like she was a
natural.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Hmmm…She was this poor girl…Came from
nothing…But then she carried nothing with her, either. I don’t know…when
you’re rich sometimes you romanticize the poor…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: I’m an emancipated minor and if you
touch me without a matron present I’ll sue you!</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: Please, mister…My…my parents.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: …and you don’t recall any of the names
Betty went out with last fall?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: They were just pickups.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: No one who would do her harm?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You made the casting rounds together. Ever
get any movie work?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So what about the film can?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: It’s…a movie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: A dirty movie?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You have to tell us the whole thing,
sweetheart. So think it through.</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: I was…cadging at a bar in Gardena.
This Mexican man - Raoul or Jorge or something - starting talking to me.
I thought I was pregnant, and I was desperate wicked bad for money. He
said he’d give me two hundred dollars to act in a nudie film.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Was this around Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: After Betty…After I read about Betty…I
went looking for him in Gardena. He was about to go back to Mexico and I
conned him out of a print.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Where was that?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: I don’t remember. On Aviation
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: A Black Dahlia stag film? I thought…I
could sell it if I had to. It was…a collector’s item.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: And he willingly gave you a copy of
the film? For nothing?</p>
<p><strong>linda martin</strong>: No. Not for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Whattya think?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I think she’s covering on the Mex angle.
Maybe she knows him and doesn’t want him taking a smut rap. Maybe he’s
white. The TJ stuff is sound, though. I’d detach Meg Caulfield from
Wilshire Clerical to play cellmate for a day.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bleichert you are a very bright penny
today. Well. Looks like it’s blue movie night at City Hall.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Gettin’ any?</p>
<p><strong>chief horrall</strong>: Whattya think, Russ? This got
anything to do with the girl’s murder–</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Long shot, Chief. Harry and I are
headed down to TJ tonight. The Mex doesn’t play as the killer. But maybe
he showed it to someone–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Who gives a fuck if he didn’t kill her! I’ve
sent Boy Scouts to the green room for less than this!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Did you see her face, Bucky? Did you see?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yeah. I did, partner. I did.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Goddammit, Blanchard! I got you
Warrants. You’re my man, and you made me look like a fool in front of
the two most powerful men in the Department. If you weren’t Mr. Fire
you’d be suspended from duty already. You’ve gotten personally involved
in the Short case–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Mr. Loew, it’s not just Betty Short–</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Shut up, Bleichert. You’re back on
Warrants as of tomorrow. Report to me at 0800 with letters of apology
for Green and Horrall. For the sake of your pension I’d suggest you
grovel.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I want to go to TJ–</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Blanchard!</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: You’ve been skating around all morning,
Bleichert. Vogel and Koenig went to Tijuana an hour ago so I need you to
check out a radio car and get out there.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: And if you see that phantom partner of
yours, tell him this no-show’s gonna cost him three days pay.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s me. You want to get together?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’ll pick you up in forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Not at the house. Daddy’s having a
business soiree. The Red Arrow.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I have an apartment, you know.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Room 11. Forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Smile at me. Look soft and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: They picked up Linda Martin yesterday. She had
a stag film of her and Betty Short playing lez. Spooky stuff.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Did she mention me?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No. And I checked through the case file.
There’s no mention of that note-leaving number you pulled. Babe, I’m
withholding evidence for you. It’s a fair trade for what I’m getting,
but it still shakes me. Is there anything you haven’t told me about
Betty and Linda?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Sugar, Betty and I made love once, that
one time we met last summer. I just did it to see what it would be like
to do it with someone who looked like me and–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bucky that’s it, I swear. Please
stay–</p>
<p><strong>radio dispatcher</strong>: Code four all units at Crenshaw
and Stocker. Two dead, suspect dead, Raymond Douglas Nash, warrant
number–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Blanchard!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I beat up a wall. Penance for Nash.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Losing the first Bleichert-Blanchard
fight got me local celebrity, Warrants, and close to nine grand in cash;
winning the rematch got me a sprained wrist, two dislocated knuckles and
the rest of the day off. Whoever said winning isn’t everything got that
part right.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: We’re famous, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Notorious, maybe. Where’s Lee?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I haven’t seen him since you beat him up.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’s in trouble, you know.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I don’t want you coming over here just to sleep
an the couch again.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Kay. Lee–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You know Dwight? Fighting, cops, guns. To most
people–that’s the scary stuff. Not everything else.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Short of winning?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Luck.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: Checked for the smut pad. Goose egg.
Peddlers–double goose egg–</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bucky. Blanchard’s in Tijuana. A
border cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch of rough-looking Rurales
last night.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: That was County Parole. Bobby DeWitt bought a
bus ticket at the Santa Rosa depot this morning. San Diego. Transfer
Tijuana.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Back in LA, Linda Short let slip that
her “Mex” was actually a local named Walter Wellington, who copped to
making the film but quickly provided the cops his alibi for the Dahlia’s
missing days.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Not that this stopped Loew and his boys
from rousting spics all over town for a possible Dahlia frame-up. The
circus was becoming a farce.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: We can’t do that! Wellington told
Tierney he made the pic–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lee’s down here and so is Bobby De Witt.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Fuck Blanchard. He’s suspended.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: You know what, kid? I got a soft spot in my
heart for light heavyweights. You promise not to hit Billy and I’ll help
you look for your partner. I’ll drive. You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>dewitt</strong>: Cops, huh? Well at least you’re American.
Never thought I’l be glad to see you guys.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Why start now?</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Lee Blanchard’s here in TJ, and you came here
flush out of Big Q. That’s a goddamned strange coincidence and I don’t
like it. I don’t like you and I don’t like being down in this
rat-infested country when I could be home with my family.</p>
<p><strong>dewitt</strong>: Ain’t seen Blanchard since my fuckin’
trial.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Do not use profanity with me, and address me
as sir.</p>
<p><strong>dewitt</strong>: Man o Manieschewitz, what a laugh. Lee
beauty gotta be scared of me ‘cause of how I flapped my trap at trial,
but all I know is what I read in the papers. Maybe I was thinkin’
revenge, maybe talkin’ trash to my cellies, but when Lee beauty killed
them niggers–</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Bobby boy I do not like Sergeant Blanchard
but he is a fellow officer and I will not have syphilitic scum like you
defaming him. Now you risked a parole violation for a trip down
here.</p>
<p><strong>dewitt</strong>: I came down to cop some heroin and move it
back to LA. I’m meeting a guy, Felix Casco, at the Gardena Motel.
Please. Don’t hurt me no more. Please.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: I’m gonna call Ellis.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Finish up with you and Blanchard.</p>
<p><strong>dewitt</strong>: Sir, all that’s between me and Blanchard is
that I fucked this cunt Kay Lake–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How long–</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: I let Bobby boy go so we could tail him to
his pal. But he blew his tail while you were catching up on your beauty
sleep, which is too bad for him.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: The spic’s Felix Casco, a known dope
trafficker. Maybe it was other dope scum, maybe Lee, maybe it was God. I
say let our Mexican colleagues handle their own dirty laundry and we go
back to LA and find the son of a bitch who sliced the Dahlia.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I spent the morning with Internal Affairs. I
told them…everything I knew. I gave them so much…and in the end it
didn’t seem like anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’ll came back, Kay. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You don’t know anything, Dwight. But that’s
what I like about you.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Kay–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I’ve been offered a job. Teaching sixth grade
at Fairfax Primary. With Lee gone now–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’s coming back.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Lee.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: …okay, yeah. So I got her name from a
producer friend of mine. Met her in a bar…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I wanted to believe it was all about
Lee. Tracking Lee through her…through the files he had collected.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Strangers’ recollections of a girl’s
last days leading me to a partner…</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: …the other girls and me, we helped her out
once in a while. Throw her a trick if she needed dough…But she was no
pro.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: But the deeper into her I got, the more
I understood the detective’s old saw: any dick worth his suit always
takes a side: the perp or the vic.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Most cops’ll tell ya…one day you wake up
and you’re in the head of the killer…Angry. Powerful. In control. You’re
the perp.</p>
<p><strong>betty short</strong>: No…Please…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Few cops’ll admit to walking the harder
path…fear…pain…loss…Few will admit to waking up in the head of the
vic.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: Don’t just walk out on me, Richard.
Say something. Say you care say you–</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: I’m sorry. There’s a pause there.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I wasn’t on the transfer list.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: I asked Jack to keep you on.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Because you’re getting to be a damn
good Detective, Bleichert. And Harry’s retiring in two years. Need I
spell it out?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You been working this case pretty
hard. Or is it the other way around?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: It’s not as much fun once it moves to
the back pages, is it? I hear they arrested two Mexicans in Juarez for
the Bobby De Witt murder.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I heard that, too.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You must be relieved.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: They’ve rescinded the APB on Lee. If he
doesn’t show up in thirty days he’s out.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: He’ll be found if he wants to be
found.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Like the guy who killed the Dahlia?</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Boyo! Glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: I called this little meeting for a
couple reasons, Bucky. We’d both like to see the Short case closed out
and get back to normal business.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Russ Millard wants me when Harry retires.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: You’re too raw for him, boyo. Old Russ is a
sob sister, and I’m much more your type.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What do you want, Ellis?</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: Very well, Dwight. I’ll tell you. There
are four confessors still being held at City Jail. They’ve got no
alibis, weren’t coherent when they were first questioned, and they’re
all violent, frothing-at-the- mouth lunatics. I want them reintegrated.
It’s a muscle job.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: I wanted Bill Koenig–</p>
<p><strong>ellis loew</strong>: But Bill’s a bit too enamored with
violence. So it’s you, Dwight. Yes or no? Because if it’s yes, I’ll make
sure you’re back on Warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some
stripes. If not, it’s Homicide shitwork until Russ Millard gets tired of
you. We both know that Russ is a patient, forbearing man, Dwight. That
could be a long time. Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: On my way over I played out their rap
sheets in my head, trying to work up a head of hate…Loren Bidwell, three
time Atascadero loser, falls for aggravated sexual assault on minors.
Between prison jolts he confessed to all the big sex crimes.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Charlie Issler was a pimp and a career
confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides. His three
procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time, his phony
confessions two ninety day observation stints at the Camarillo nut
farm.</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: You all confessed to killing the Dahlia. We
can’t prove you did, so you’re gonna have to convince us… Query on,
Bucko.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Tell me about Betty Short, pops. Why’d you
kill her?</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Don’t be timid, boyo. That bird made little
boys suck his hog.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Come clean, pop.</p>
<p><strong>bidwell</strong>: I didn’t kill her mister. I just wanted a
ticket to the honor farm. Three hots and a cot, that’s all. Please,
mister.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Tell me about it, Cecil.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: You get that line from Dick Tracy or
Gangbusters?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: One more time, shitbird. Tell me about you
and Betty Short.</p>
<p><strong>durkin</strong>: I fucked Betty Short and I fucked your mama!
I’m your fucking daddy!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m the nice guy, Cecil. Keep that in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: Please. I didn’t kill Liz. I don’t know why
I do these things, and I apologize. So please don’t let that man hurt
me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Convince me.</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I…can’t. I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You’re a pimp. You know Betty Short?</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why’d you confess to her murder?</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: She looked so…sweet and pretty and I felt so
bad. I always confess to the pretty ones.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You feel guilty Charlie? You hit your girls,
get ’em high on hop?</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I do such nasty things I don’t know why–</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: This kid glove routine’s gettin’ old–</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I…don’t…know…anything!</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Tell me what you know!</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I knew you at Ad Vice!</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: Tell me what your girls tell you!</p>
<p><strong>another typewritten sheet</strong>: “LAPD Transfer orders:
Officer Dwight Bleichert…From: Central Warrants…To: Foot Patrol,
Swingwatch. Central Station…”</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: East 5th Street from Main to Stanford.
Blood banks, liquor stores selling half pints and short dogs
exclusively, fifty- cent-a-night flophouses and derelict missions…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Banished by Ellis Loew, who dared me to
try my word against a twenty-two year man and the city’s future District
Attorney. I confined the truth to Russ and Kay, and determined to spend
my shifts trying to be the worst foot hack in history.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: A month passed. The Dahlia leads
dwindled to zero and every officer except Russ and Harry were returned
to their regular assignments. As for me, I’d been able to contain my
Dahlia interests within the walls of the El Nido.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You’ll be back. I look like her.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: But sometimes Betty came to me…</p>
<p><strong>betty short</strong>: Bucky! No! Stop him! I’ll do whatever
you want…</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I’ll be okay….Liz…</p>
<p><strong>millard</strong>: Bucky. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You ever hear anyone refer to Betty as Liz?
Anyone at all?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Issler did.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: The pimp? I thought he said he’d never
heard of her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You know what else he said?</p>
<p><strong>vogel</strong>: What did you know about the Dahlia’s missing
days?</p>
<p><strong>issler</strong>: I knew you at Ad Vice–</p>
<p><strong>harry sears</strong>: N-n-no, Russ. No file on Issler.
Gone.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Fritzie didn’t give a damn about those other
three. It was all about Issler. Never occurred to me before.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bright penny–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hello, Charlie. Get lost?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: So good ol’ Fritzie’s shaking down
crooks, maybe sellin’ ’em tip-offs before a roust.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I want him nailed.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Easy, penny. They’d have to testify
against him first. And that’s not likely after he burns those carbons.
But this Issler business–why hide the Issler- Betty connection?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Maybe Charlie pimped her out…to somebody
Fritzie doesn’t want us to know about…</p>
<p><strong>fritzie</strong>: Tell me what you know about the Dahlia’s
missing days–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I knew it. Here. Betty writes to one of her
phantom servicemen boyfriends: “…had drinks with a great girl, Sally
Stinson, who thinks she way be able to help me get a job
cocktailing…”</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Cocktailing.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yeah, I know. That’s what made it stick with
me…What next, padre?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You sit tight. Go hack to swingwatch.
Me and Harry’ll poke around.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I want him.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You’ll get him, too. But you’ve got to
cool your temper. It’s all patience with the big fish or they wriggle
off.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: What kept me up that night wasn’t the
idea of Fritz Vogel extorting criminals, or Fritz Vogel bracing Charlie
the pimp to see if Betty had told him something about one of her
johns…maybe even Vogel, himself…No…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: …what kept me up was this thought: if
Issler blabbed about Liz and her tricks I would have overheard. Fritz
was confident he could keep me quiet.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: We’ve found her. Meet me at 1546 North
Havenhurst in half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I do a lot a cops, you know. Comes with the
territory. Charlie used to say it was my union dues. Keep my operator’s
license.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Ma’am. Please get to it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Anyway. It was a full-day job. C-Note and a
half. Kept talkin’ about givin’ me “The Big Schnitzel”…more like a
cocktail frank once we got down to it…Well, we screw the whole
afternoon…Go down to the lobby for some dinner and there’s Liz, sittin’
by herself.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You’d hooked with her before?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Three or four times. Conventioneers. And
lemme tell you something, I’m pretty good at faking it. But Liz, she was
good. A virtuoso, Academy Award kind of stuff–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: –She do dyke?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bucky–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No. Nothing like that.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Any porn?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No. But I bet she’d be gooood…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Did anything unusual happen?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I think it got a little kinky. He’d brought a
couple toys…He may have…whipped her a bit.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Did Vogel say anything about Liz? Was he
gonna see her again? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He said…she liked the Big Schnitzel.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Anything else, Miss Stinson?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Two days…after…Liz got in all the papers…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Is this when your pimp Charlie confesses?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yeah. Bad habit. Anyways, Fritzie V. shows up
and shakes me hard about Charlie, whether he’d say anything about Liz to
the caps. Beat me bad. Real bad.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: One last time to be sure. You are sure this
is the man that you tricked with? And tricked with Liz Short?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: No mister you got it all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: But you said–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Fritz just beat me. It was Sonny me and Liz
did. Sonny.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: I’ll be a chimp’s priest, Buck. A
chimp’s priest–watch the air bubbles–I shoulda known that Johnny I d
need a pro to lose his cherry…Never had ’em for a kink and a cherry,
though…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Johnny–</p>
<p><strong>johnny vogel</strong>: Whatcha doin’ in civvies,
Bleichert?</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Pentothal’s good for another couple
hours. No way he can lie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Elizabeth Short, shitbird. Elizabeth fucking
Short!</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: There’s a method to this, Bucky.
What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You know me, loot.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Answer me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Vogel, John G.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: What’s sixteen and fifty-two?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uhmmm. Sixty-eight. Why’d you hit me
Bleichert? I didn’t do you no dirt.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Focus on January, Johnny. Your
father–</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Friedrich Vogel. Fritzie.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Yes. Fritzie. He wanted you to lose
your cherry. He bought you a woman for two days. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not a woman. Not a real one. A hoooer.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: This was at the Biltmore?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Daddy got a good rate on the room. He knew
the house dick…This ain’t right…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: We’ll be done soon, Johnny. You met
Liz Short at the Biltmore, too?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s her name introduced me…the hooer.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: And what did you and Liz do?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We…played horse and rider. Gave her the Big
Schnitz.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Did you whip her?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Softly. So so softly. Horse and Rider.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Johnny. Did you kill Liz Short?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No no no no! I didn’t kill her!</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Easy son–</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t slice her!</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: It’s all right…Do you know who
did?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: When your Daddy found out you’d been
with her, he tried to fix things didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Daddy…went to Ellis…to the Jewboy. Wanted to
get Charlie released…but the Jewboy said no…Daddy had a morgue friend
owed him a favor and got this DOA cooze…Daddy wanted Uncle Bill but
Ellis Jewboy said take Bleichert. Daddy said you’d do it cuz without
Blanchard you were jelly. Said you were a sob sister, weak sister…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: I think you should go outside.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: His statement. Signed.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: We should sit on this for a little
bit. Until I can talk to a legal officer.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: It’s the shithouse until you retire,
you know that.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I owe her this one.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No comment…No comment… Tell your Daddy I know
everything. Including his extortion deal. Tell him I’m goin’ to the
papers tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m Officer Dwight Bleichert and this is
Officer John Vogel.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Officer Bleichert, go to the watch
commander’s office immediately.</p>
<p><strong>jastrow</strong>: You’re on two weeks vacation leave as of
now. When you return to duty, report to Chief Green. He’ll reassign you
to another division.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jastrow</strong>: Fritz Vogel just blew his brains out.
That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: Are you all right, Miss Short?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: Put the sides down. Just…talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: What would you like to talk
about?</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: I don’t know…Anything…Do you have a
boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to Santa
Barbara, or even a drive to San Francisco…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Kay.</p>
<p><strong>fay</strong>: You don’t owe him a thing, Bucky. I know you
won’t believe me. But you’ve more than repaid him already.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: First thing.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You’re a fool, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I closed out my glory days the only way
I knew how–I chased the gone man.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides
and a strange series of tales that rang true. One had “el blanco
explosivo” beating the shit out of three jack rollers, then buying off
the cops with double-saws peeled from a large roll. Another had Lee
donating 200 scoots to a leper ministry priest and then driving to
Ensenada.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I decided it would be wise to check in
with the law before going out to question the Ensenada citizenry.</p>
<p><strong>captain vasquez</strong>: Officer Bleichert. Come in, please.
I’m Captain Vasquez. How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: This man’s LAPD. He’s been missing in Mexico
since January. He was last seen headed here.</p>
<p><strong>captain vasquez</strong>: No. I’m afraid not. I’ll ask my
men, however. Staying the night?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>vasquez</strong>: Are you here alone?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I have two partners waiting for me in
Tijuana.</p>
<p><strong>captain vasquez</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign:
“CLUB BOXEO”. Bucky goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Bleichert? Jesus. First Blanchard, then
you. Who’s next? Willie Pep?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Blanchard? You’ve seen him? When?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Couple months ago. Heavy rains in February.
Musta talked fights for ten hours straight. You know Blanchard thinks
the feathers are the best division? me, it’s the middies for sure. La
Motta, Graziano–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Is he still in town?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Don’t think so. I own this place. He ain’t
been back. You lookin’ for a rematch?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m looking to get him out of a shitload of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Well. I’ll tell ya the little I know. Heard
he caused a ruckus over at the Club Satan, had to bribe his way out big
with Captain Vasquez. Talk to Ernie the cook. Tell him I said to be
kosher with you.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You ain’t been in there.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: You wan’ the bar, handsome? Breakfast of
champions, one dollar. Round the world, two dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Ernie. I need to see Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Vamanos!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I heard this man gave you some trouble a
while back.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: You his friend?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He’s my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Your friend drink fourteen shots of my best
Mescal, a house record. That I like. He make toasts to dead women. That
I don’t mind. But he try to fuck with my donkey show, and that I don’t
take.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Four of my guys he take, the fifth he don’t.
Rurales take him home to sleep it off.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Finito.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Whoa, Bleichert. I’m a friend–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You tell me all of it and you watch what you
say about my partner, or it’s a B&amp;E roust and the Ensenada jail.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: You mean Vasquez? How do you think I knew
to follow you? He’s got a vested interest in you not finding out about
Blanchard.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Does he know I’m staying here?</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So. Let’s hear it.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: About a month ago this Mexican woman shows
up at my office in Dago. Chubby, ten tons a makeup, but dressed to the
nines. Offers me five hundred to find Blanchard. Just like you I track
him here where he’s playing the rich gringo–</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: I even see him beat up two spics who
insult this Senorita–Rurales stand by and do nothing. So I know he’s
paying protection dough. A lot of it. Then I hear he paid off two
plainclothes Rurale to snuff a coupla guys in TJ–</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: I leave a message in Dago for the woman
tellin’ her what I know…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: Delores Garcia. But it was obviously a
phony. Casco ran with some rich bimbos and I’m betting she’s one of his.
Revenge on Blanchard for offin’ Felix.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: I come back to Ensenada on my own,
thinking about all that cash he was flashing.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: Blanchard’s dead. Bullet in the cabeza.
Rumor is they never found any money.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Prove it to me. Prove it!</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: The locals keep the damn thing lit up.
They got a lotta missing relatives.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You got a shovel?</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: Gardening tools–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Good enough.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: Here. Supposed to be near el bannero.</p>
<p><strong>dolphine</strong>: Sailor’s uniform. It’s a sailor…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Lee and Kay had lived in sin; not
because their shack job was against department regs, but because the
ghosts of their past had forced them to choose between love and passion,
the veneer of a “fairy tale” only a band-aid for a fractured life.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Our true vows were made in private; bury
the past, bury our ghosts, and as Kay said, “bury that fucking
girl”…</p>
<p><strong>another lapd transfer form</strong>: “Officer Dwight
Bleichert…Reassigned to: Scientific investigation Detail”</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Bleichert? You got those prints for
me?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …results in the 1948 Republican primary
are final…John Dougdale trouncing D.A. Ellis Loew 64% to 36%…In county
primaries…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: That reminds me of something, Dwight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Floorboard’s loose near the closet. Think you
could fix it?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Sure, babe.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Sounds lovely. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hancock Park.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m Officer Bleichert. LAPD. My I express my
condolences, Mrs.–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Jane Chambers. Condolences accepted. You’re
the lab man?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: It’s the study in back of the dining
room. You’ll see the police rope. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll be in my
garden.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: The other survivors. Pretty aren’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Like their mother. How old are they?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Twenty-one and twenty-three. Are you
finished in the study?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yes. Tell whoever cleans it up to use pure
ammonia… Mrs. Chambers–</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Jane.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Jane, do you know Madeleine and Martha
Sprague? The next block over?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Those girls and that family. How do
you know them?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I did a little work for them once.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Consider it lucky if it was a brief
encounter.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Back to condolences. Thank you for
being so nice, Mr.–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Bucky. Good-bye, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: You finish working up the suicide, Bucky?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yeah. Pretty routine. Whattya know about the
husband?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Eldridge Chambers? Widow said he was depressed,
failing health. The terrible burden of all that money’ll get you every
time.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Wonder how he made it?</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: No mystery there. Real estate.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth short</strong>: …I had a fiance, Captain Matt
Durand. He was in a tank battalion. A Commander. He had…the fiercest
blue eyes. Like the deep water you see from a fishing boat…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m…looking for the hammer.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Were you ever going to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: He’d given all his money to Ben Siegel. He
wanted to give me a home.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: …said I’d get a shot at Joe Louis if I’d take
two dives for him. I said no…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Were you ever going to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: He knew what Bobby was doing to me…How he’d
used a razor on me…pimped me to his friends…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: …Bobby know nothing about the bank job. He and
Lee, they never even met. After Lee and his driver got away, Lee figured
framing Bobby’d give me a way out…</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Then last year…the fourth man–the driver–he
heard Bobby was getting paroled. He threatened to tell DeWitt that Lee
framed him. He wanted money we didn’t have. Ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Ever. Were you ever…?</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Promise me this: Forgive him for DeWitt.
Forgive him for the bank. It doesn’t matter anymore. Not to us.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Who was the driver, Kay? Tell me. Tell
me!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Baxter Fitch.</p>
<p><strong>baxter fitch</strong>: Blanchard?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Fire and Ice. The hero and the snitch.
Bank robber and his best friend the bumfuck detective. Triggerman.
Stooge. Weak point in a fairy tale triangle.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: So. What brings you around again?
Considering a courtin’ the old rich widow?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You’re not that old. And you’re not very
widowed.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: You either are or you aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You seem to be doing all right.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Eldridge had cancer. I half expected
it. We weren’t that close anymore…You married?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Little over a year.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: God. Newlyweds. Nothing better, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So how well do you know the Spragues?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Eldridge and Emmett went way back.
They served on the California real estate board together. But Emmett was
a bit of a crook. My husband got him kicked off the board for building
dangerous buildings under phony corporations.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your husband sounds like a good man.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: He had his moments. Most of it was
out of guilt. He owned slum blocks in San Pedro. When he learned he had
cancer, he really started feeling guilty. He voted Democratic last year.
Even went in and had meetings with the City Council. I’m sure he gave
them dirt on Emmett.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I read an article in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Same day Eldridge killed himself.
Apropos, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Maybe your husband–</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: My husband was rich and did a mean
Charleston. I loved him until I found out he was cheating on me. Now I’m
starting to love him again. How strange.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s not so strange.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: You’re very accepting of other
people’s frailties. You’re young. You should have illusions.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’m a cop. Illusions aren’t standard
issue.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: So how’d a cop get mixed up with
Madeleine Sprague? It was Madeleine, I assume?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I stopped her at a red light. One thing led
to another. Why do you assume it was Madeleine?</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Don’t play dumb, Bucky. The girl’s a
roundheels. Always has been.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Jane. Don’t be catty.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: I’m sorry. She can’t help it I’m
sure. She probably inherited it from her mother.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: You figure out the rest, officer.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: God that is spooky.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Valuable, too. Eldridge bought it for
my birthday a couple years ago. I hate it. Want to take it with you?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: Thank you, then. You were my best
condoler.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And you mine.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Dwight–</p>
<p><strong>thad green</strong>: SID’s not a bad beat, Bucky. At the time
it was better than you deserved.</p>
<p><strong>another lapd transfer order</strong>: “Transfer order…Officer
Bleichert…From SID…to Newton Street Division, Nightwatch.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Newton Street Division. Footbeat hacks
carried metal-studded saps; squadroom dicks packed .45 automatics loaded
with unregulation dum-dums.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Kay. Lee. Madeleine. Betty Short. For
one month I escaped them all.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: A fucking supercop.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I escaped them all. Almost.</p>
<p><strong>old drunk</strong>: Pleease!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: It was a reunion of avowed tramps, old
rutters who knew they’d never have it as good with anyone else…
Afterwards we’d talk through the night. The Spragues…Crazy Papa
Bleichert…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Mostly, though we’d talk about Betty.
Her utter malleability, a chameleon eager to please anybody…and the
disrupter of every life close to me…It would last a month.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You miss ’em, laddie? Mother’s insults?
Martha’s pornography…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your father’s Georgie Tilden war stories?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: In the scheme of things it wasn’t much.
Rich old lady gossip, as Jane put it.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Hey! Goddammit! Get back here!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: I didn’t touch your things. You can have the
furniture.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Babe–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Did you think I’d let my husband disappear for
three weeks and do nothing about it? I’ve had detectives following you,
Dwight. Detectives. She looks like that fucking dead girl, so you can
have her–not me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Babe. Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Whoremonger. Coward. Necrophile.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: It came on then, big and ugly: bye-bye
Bleichert at the bus stop, adios shitbird, has-been, never-was, stool
pigeon harness bull.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: THE HOLLYWOODLAND SIGN. As we watch the
sign changes, the “D” dropping off the end. It now reads</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Can I help you? . Great. Take a hike you big
sicko–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Wait–</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: It’s all right, dear. I know this
pug.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Came into a little change a while back,
managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs. And I don’t
give a fuck what you think, you and your partner ain’t much to look at
now. I read the papers.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You didn’t move far.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Wouldn’t a mattered if I did. Whatcha
here for, mug? I know you ain’t smart enough to solve the case, and you
ain’t dumb enough to still think I did it…I had an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Tighter’n a popcorn fart.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: And that’s air tight, mug. Air
tight.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I just thought…Maybe after all this
time…There’s something you might have forgot…Anything she might have
said…</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: She was a terrible actress. I’m sure
folks’ve told you that. She’d practice in front of the john mirror. Once
or twice she got me in on it…Reading parts with her for some audition.
She stunk. Even a parent could tell. What Beth was good at was writing.
All her teachers used to say that. Not that a grease like me’d know the
difference. Maybe she coulda written for the pictures. But she wanted to
be an actress like every other silly girl.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: My father.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: He proud of his son, the ace copper? Or
maybe he thought you’d end up champ?</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Your momma?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: She killed herself a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Probably better off then.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thank you for your time, Mr. Short. if–</p>
<p><strong>cleo short</strong>: Get a life, Bleichert. Don’t dream it
all away. Dreamin’ll kill ya. You, too. Get me a sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I tried to keep calm. I told myself that
just because Emmett Sprague helped Mack Sennett build sets in the
twenties didn’t mean he had anything to do with a smut film twenty-five
years later.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Mack Sennett? Helped him build that
housing project he was putting up– Hollywoodland–</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: I got your message, Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Look, Russ…I think…I may have it. I–</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: It?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Her! Her! I’ve got a hot one, padre. It’s
just…</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Calm down, son. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: I told him everything. Me and Madeleine,
the Spragues. Withholding evidence for her. Everything. Even Lee. After
all of it he only had one thing to say:</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: All right, then. It’s your ball. What
do you wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I want to search every fucking inch of every
goddamn acre of Emmett Sprague property if it takes the rest of my
shitty career. And I know exactly where we start.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Between my time with Madeleine and the
local boom baron expose in the papers, I was practically an expert on
Emmett Sprague’s land deals…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: And if my hunch was right, we wouldn’t
have to look any further than one of Emmett Sprague’s condemned
bungalows. One that was isolated…abandoned…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: …and most importantly, close to a water
source…where one could drain a body of its blood.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Bucky.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: God help her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Box up the books and papers. Maybe light that
lantern.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Thing is, Russ. Thing is…There’s another set
of latents up there on the doorjamb…And my hands’re shaking so bad I
can’t transfer ’em.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: We finally have it, Russ. All of it. All of
her. All right here.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: Are you sure you don’t want to came
home? Mrs. Millard’ll fix up the couch.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: No. Thanks. I’ll stay here. I want to get up
early and confirm these prints.</p>
<p><strong>russ millard</strong>: You’re a very very bright penny,
Officer.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: …besides, one of my foremen said the
goddamn pipes are spewing gas…There’ll be hell to pay. It’s about time I
showed the three of you good ol’ Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I don’t wanna go to Europe, Daddy. You’re
always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: …they’ve got what you need,
lassie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And what is that, Emmett? Saps like me?
Direct line to the straight dope? Or is that what you needed?</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Aaah, laddie.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: George Tilden killed Elizabeth Short and the
two of you covered it up.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Georgie was always…sneaking around
Daddy’s properties. He saw them make it…He…got crazy about Betty.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Of course. She looked like his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: In the Argonne, Georgie used to
bayonet the dead Gerries. I saw it. Thrilled him, it did. He
was…hmm…disturbed. I think Ramona found him…a good way to strike back at
me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How’d it all go down?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It was Sunday I remember…Betty
called…short of cash as usual. I put Daddy on, and he offered Betty
money to date a nice man he knew. Georgie’d been driving Daddy crazy,
wanting to get with Betty ever since the movie. Threatening to tell
people he was my father. But we thought Georgie just wanted her for
sex.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He was a sick fuck and you knew it!</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: He was passive. He liked to touch
dead things. His father was a surgeon, did you know that? Famous in
Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What did you tell Betty? What did you tell
her?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: We said he was a war hero. Because we
didn’t want her to feel like a whore.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Then?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You know the rest.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Pretend I’m stupid. For old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I went looking for Linda Martin, and I
found her at a motel in the Valley. I gave her money and told her to say
the stag was filmed in Tijuana with a Mexican crew.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And then what? I come along? Daddy tell you
to fuck me or was that your idea?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bucky–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bucky–</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Ramona didn’t know a thing.
Martha–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: What about sweet little Martha?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Martha knew I’d been with Betty. But that
was all. But she’s a demon, you know. She even called the cops with a
tip on La Verne’s–just hoping I’d get smeared in the papers. I scratched
her good for that.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Martha tell you this?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Then she lied to get your goat, ’cuz no one
ever called in a tip on LaVerne’s.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Figures.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Passports. All four.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: Don’t insult me, lad.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: We’ll ruin you in court, you know. If you
go after us, we’ll ruin you. Over what? Some little slut–</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: You know, laddie. The rich don’t
necessarily own art just for themselves; we safekeep it for future
generations.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I need to see it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: It?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Just to be sure. I need to see it.</p>
<p><strong>emmett sprague</strong>: I’m not sure I know…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I need to see his grave, you tightass
kiltwearing motherfucker. Where’d you bury George Tilden?</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: When I’d pulled George’s print card that
morning, I’d already laid fifty down with Russ that he was our guy.
Amateur taxidermist, transient. If he was a cop 39th and Norton woulda
been right in the middle of his beat…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: But I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t
wanted to nail the sicko myself, giving him ten rounds of Bleichert
rage.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Maybe he’d have gone for a gun or
probably a knife, and the Bleichert fists would’ve given way to a full
load of .45 in the chest.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: …and then Eldridge said: I’m sure
that’s the case Mr. Mayor, but that’s not my dog and those sure as hell
aren’t my shoes!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yeah, well. Old habits die hard.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: I’d been thinking about giving it to
charity, but it’s too valuable. I found Eldridge’s receipt…</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Yes, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: You’ll appreciate the
coincidence–</p>
<p><strong>jane chambers</strong>: What is it–</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I’m in here, officer.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I know what you did, Ramona. You and Georgia.
I’ve seen the painting. You sold it the day of the murder. You know I’ve
got the book. And now I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: We see you out there, you know. Every night.
We see you. You don’t fool us. You didn’t hurt Georgie. You didn’t hurt
Madeleine. And as much as I wish you would, you didn’t hurt Emmett.
You’re a voyeur. That’s all the lesser classes have. Pressing their nose
up against the glass.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: So tell me. Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Emmett slashed his face, I’m sure you know.
Madeleine was eleven and she looked just like Georgie. When he got out
of the hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a present. My Gwynplain. But
he was afraid of Emmett’s rage…After that…we rarely spoke.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Tell me about Betty Short.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Your husband bought her for George.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Emmett never stopped hating me.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: For George–</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: For being richer than he was.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: You tortured her.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: She lied about that. To get Madeleine’s
goat.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Oh is that so? You poor boy. Your life is
worse than mine. Maybe the cruel joke is on you.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Dwight?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How much of the hundred grand did Lee let you
keep?</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He knew about Madeleine Sprague. He knew
about Laverne’s Hideaway.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He blackmailed Sprague–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: –Don’t come over. Daddy’s having a
business soiree–</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: –Penance for Junior Nash–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He
took that hundred thousand and split to Mexico and you let him go!</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: You are so, so good at some things.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: He was going to leave no matter what. I didn’t
know if I was ever going to see him again, and I wanted him to be
comfortable if such a thing was possible. Dwight, he knew I was in love
with you, and he wanted us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: He didn’t leave, he ran. He ran from the bank
job, ran from the frame on DeWitt. He knew who killed Elizabeth Short
and fucking ran away! This whole time. You both knew everything–</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Goddammit, Dwight! That girl–that girl! I don’t
give a damn about that girl. She ruined our lives!</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Adios yourself back to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird. I’ve got business with the lady.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: I’ve been pointing my gun at a lot of people
this week. But I haven’t had much of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya
think?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I think you’d rather fuck me than kill
me. But you don’t have the guts to do either. You’re a boxer. Not a
puncher.</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short to the
very end, eh?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking
about–</p>
<p><strong>bucky</strong>: How ’bout the Mexican accent you used when
you hired the private dick to track down Lee. Let’s see the make-up job.
Let’s see the fucking dress, mamacita, that you wore when you chased
after poor daddy’s money. Tell me something–you shoot Lee yourself?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You’ll never do it. Never. Remember…I
look like her.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: We took the fall together.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Ever the consummate actor, Madeleine
Sprague confessed to killing Lee by concocting a love triangle from the
three of us…The Bleichert/Blanchard rematch fought over her hand, with
Lee beating Emmett and demanding he “hand over” his daughter when she
preferred me.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: So the brass girl took the fall for the
whole family. And I took the fall for me. IAD cleared me on the motel
shooting–a cop’s code make-good for Blanchard’s snuff.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: …but I had people to protect…People who
already knew that, for the briefest of times, and in the darkest of
places, I had been so, so, good at some things.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Thank you Elizabeth.</p>
