id="boondock-saints-2-all-saints-day">boondock-saints-2-all-saints-day</h1>
<p><strong>man v.o.</strong>: There’s two kinds of people in this world
when you boil it all down. You got your talkers and you got your
doers.</p>
<p><strong>rocco v.o.</strong>: Most people are just talkers. All they
got is talk. But when all’s said and done, it is the doers who change
the world. And when they do that, they change us. That’s why we never
forget them…So, which one are you? Do you just talk about it? Or do you
stand up and do something about it? Because believe you me all the rest
of it is just coffee house bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>subtext</strong>: “Ireland”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Looks like a storm’s comin’.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>moody music</strong>: The brothers drive the flock across
jewel green hills. Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it
off.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: Peace, they say, is the enemy of
memory. So it had been for my boys.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: For some time now, their past had felt
like a dream to them…faded and worn.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: POPPA M’s face as he coughs and watches
his sons approach from his rocking chair on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: And then suddenly, as if not a day had
passed…it was back. I could see it in their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: I could feel it, heavy in their
presence. Something calling them back.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo, close on</strong>: Crew Cut’s boots as he paces
toward. The threatening music bleeds over to…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo, close on</strong>: A wolf’s paws as it paces
toward…</p>
<p><strong>boston</strong>: Crew Cut quickly enters the church.</p>
<p><strong>ireland</strong>: The wolves burst from the tree line.</p>
<p><strong>boston</strong>: A frantic priest in his 50’s weeps and begs
as Crew Cut slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.</p>
<p><strong>ireland</strong>: The wolves savagely attack the screaming
sheep.</p>
<p><strong>boston</strong>: Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the
altar.</p>
<p><strong>ireland</strong>: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast
shotguns at the wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform
mercy killings on the wolf and one sheep.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: “And they cried out, How long O’Lord
dost thou not judge and revenge our blood upon them that dwell on the
earth?”</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: And God said, “All will fear the wrath
of the lamb. For the great day of their reckoning hath come.”</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: “And they that holdest my name shall come
with the shaking of the earth and the roiling of the oceans.”</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: Something’s happened.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: There is no new information on the
victim found slain this morning inside Trinity Church. As you can see
the size of the crowd here has increased substantially over the last
couple of hours. People are demanding answers as to how a priest could
be murdered in a church. But perhaps more shocking, we have confirmed
that the body was ritualized with pennies in the eyes. Many remember
this as the grisly calling card of the prolific vigilante killers known
as the Saints, who went on a murder spree here in Boston.</p>
<p><strong>news footage</strong>: People scream as they run out of a
courthouse.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1 v.o.</strong>: A rampage that ended six years
ago, when the Saints brazenly walked into open court…</p>
<p><strong>news footage</strong>: A body is wheeled out on a gurney.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1 v.o.</strong>: …and executed Mafia Don, Poppa Joe
Yakavetta before a courtroom of terrified witnesses, then simply
disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1 v.o.</strong>: The now legendary security camera
footage from that harrowing day, our singular tiny glimpse of these
infamous and controversial killers.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: As police have yet to confirm the
Saints’ possible involvement, the ominous question hangs heavy in the
air. “Are they back?”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The priest. Did they release his name?</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: No. But I made a few calls, still got some
friends in the diocese there. McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: You knew him?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular Mother
Theresa. Youth hostels, soup kitchens. Even made it into the newspapers
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: Listen boys. I think it’s best that ya just
stay put and we’ll try ta figure out what…</p>
<p><strong>moody music</strong>: The boys begin to look more like
“themselves” as the they cut their hair and beards with sheep
sheers.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: We need to keep our heads, here. It’s
probably not even them.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Of course it ain’t them but that doesn’t
really matter, does it. Our skeletons just came screaming out of the
closet. We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: We’re not fucked.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: We are totally fucked!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: …and not just fucked, like elephant dick,
pounded in the ass, no reach around, jungle fucked!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Now’s not the time to panic, Green beans!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Oh, I disagree. Now’s the perfect time to
panic. We’re all Accessories to…</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Don’t you fucking say it!</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: a gravestone. “Paul M. Smecker, 1956 -
2003”</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: I didn’t even know he had a protege. What is
this bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years old.
Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man. This
brawd’s gonna be a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: She was assigned to OCD two years back. She
can shoot a gun, set three course records during her training.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna- be.
We gotta get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: She is also an authority on the Saints case.
Which means Smecker must have walked her through it.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: And the hits just keep on comin’.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Naw…I’m in no condition. I’d just slow ’em
down.</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk them
out of this?</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: We don’t even know what this is yet!
Somebody could just be tryin’ ta get away with murder here!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Aye. Only there’s about a thousand easier
ways ta do that. Trust me. Someone’s callin’ them out, Sibeal. Ya kill a
priest in a church and make it look like they did it. Bring ‘em back
with a vengeance. Don’t know who. Don’t know why. But someone thinks
he’s real fuckin’ clever. Only one problem with his little plan.</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: What’s dat?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: It worked.</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: Jesus Christ! D’er’s too much we don’t know
and if you’re won’t at least try ta talk some sense into them, I
will!</p>
<p><strong>sibeal</strong>: Exactly what do you intend to do?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Every last motherfucker that had anything to
do with it.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Game time. How are we playing this?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Feds love to pull the divide and conquer
routine. We hard line her. Stick together on this. Agreed?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Agreed. We’re a brick wall.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Let’s rock this bitch.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: EUNICE BLOOM exits the squad and moves
toward.</p>
<p>****: You hafta be Detectives Dolly and Duffy. Am I right? Eunice
Bloom. A pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And you must be Greenly. Smecker always said
you were the funny one.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: T’sup…I mean, what? Yeah, well, funny as in
ha ha, though not like funny as in gay cuz…I’m not…played high school
football.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Look, with all due respect, Agent Bloom…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Special.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You see there’s a “special” before my
“agent.” If we are going to address each other formally, I’d prefer if
you popped it in there. Makes me feel, I don’t know…special. Of course,
I’d hoped we could be a little more personable. In fact, I’d like you to
call me Eunice.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: O’kay, Eunice. I don’t see why the fuck the
Fed is…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Whoa, whoa, “fuck?” This isn’t a “fuck”
situation, is it? I can see a “God Damn” or two but why skip all the way
to “fuck” right off the bat? Let’s start slow and work our way up to
it.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What is the Fed’s interest in this?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Their interest, Detective, is capturing the
men responsible for the murders of 22 of Boston’s finest criminals.
Y’see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for
us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for
them. The FBI tends to take exception to such things. They coulda sent
anyone. They sent me. Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>****: Well, since we’ve broken the “Fuck Barrier,” allow me to be
blunt.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: It is because I am so fucking smart that I
make smart people feel like retards. Now, we seem to be getting off on
the wrong foot here. I’d appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let’s chalk it
up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend. A
man who taught me everything I know.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Lovely. Now what’s with the circus?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The victim was killed late last night. When
people gathered for morning mass, they found the front entrance chained
and padlocked. A locksmith came out, cut the chain and surprise,
surprise. Cell phones. Half of them called the cops. Half of them called
the media. But regardless…word’s out.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And it looks like that’s just the way
somebody wanted it. What say we scrape the shit off this cow’s ass,
fellas? Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: What? No, yeah, no. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Do you want a cup of coffee or
something?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Never touch the stuff.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: It wasn’t them…but I’m sure you boys already
knew that.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The two “V’s.” The victim and venue don’t add
up.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Let’s go with the venue first. Our
perpetrators are devout. They would never commit such an act on sacred
ground. And as for the victim?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: All their vics were criminals. Clearly not
the case here. So, it wasn’t them which means this is a local matter and
it falls under our jurisdiction. No need for Federal involvement so with
all due respect…we’ll see you later, Special Agent Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Man, I hate it when people say that. “With
all due respect.” Because it is inevitably followed by a disrespectful
remark. I’ll give you an example. With all due respect, Detective, this
matter falls under whatever jurisdiction I fuckin’ say it does.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Uh, so…let’s just…what can you tell us about
the shooters?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Shoo-ter. Singular. And I can tell you that
he is left handed and how shall I put this delicately…? He’s a short
bastard.</p>
<p>****: One guy, lefty, short. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I’ll show you what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Detective Greenly, you’re the victim.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: David. You can call me David.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Very well, David.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The Saints’ signature stance. Copley Plaza
Hotel four years ago. Two men of identical height put Yuri Petrova on
his knees and each dropped iron to the back of his head.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Eyes front, David. The position of the
victim and the angles produced by the killers’ stance created a unique
scenario. The bullets criss crossed in the skull and exited the eye
sockets. Here, this did not occur. The rounds moved on a straight
trajectory through the back of the victim’s head and out the front.
Which happens when…</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: …one guy’s holding two guns to the back of
your head.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: One guy.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Now, the victim falls forward. If you
please, David.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The killer approached the body from the left
side… …and flipped him to the right.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Left handed.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yep, southpaw.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: But you said he was wicked short.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The Saints were later determined to be five
foot eleven inches tall. It’s just dumb luck that the Russian and
McKinney are the exact same height.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The rounds exited Petrova’s eye balls. Here
they came out the lower cheek.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Three, four inches below the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That puts him at five, seven-ish. That’s not
uncommonly short.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The killer posed as a late night confessor.
Once the victim entered the booth the killer had him isolated. No
escape. Short stuff exits his confessional and kicks in the door of the
priest’s chamber…</p>
<p><strong>eunice v.o.</strong>: …leaving a crescent shaped indentation
which indicates that this cowboy was wearing a boot with a pronounced
heel.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Gave him a couple inches. We’re looking at
about five foot five, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: That’s wicked short.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Wicked.</p>
<p><strong>deck hand</strong>: They’re brawling in the hold! Better get
your bets in now!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Why are his hands chained?</p>
<p><strong>mexican seaman</strong>: Romeo’s fast, man. He says the
Frenchman can’t lay a hand on him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: But he can’t hit him back.</p>
<p><strong>mexican seaman</strong>: That’s the bet. He’s got to last
five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This guy’s fuckin’ crazy.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Fifty on the Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: You should never fight a Mexican, Frenchy.
Pound for pound, the toughest mother fuckers on earth. Know why? We like
pain. We like it, Pierre. I mean think about it, “tabasco sauce.” What
kinda fucked up people would even invent that shit?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Don’t be scared. Remember, I can’t hit you. I
ain’t gonna hit ya. Ain’t gonna hit ya. Ain’t gonna…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ooooo. Found the loophole, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Aughtta be a lawyer! Got the ’fine print on
y’ass! Pursuant to! Pro bono! Pari Pasu! I’ll knock you out on
contingency, mother fucker.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, shit. FIRE! FIRE!</p>
<p><strong>roughneck #1</strong>: Out of zee way!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Whoa! Uh, merci, uh, si vous plait.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just protectin’ our investment. Ya made us
fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, thank, God. Irish, huh? Finally some
class. I’m Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Connor.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy. Why were you yellin’ “fire”?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I heard you were supposed to on t.v.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: That’s if you’re gettin’ raped.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh…I’d be more inclined to go with something
like, “THAT DOESN’T GO THERE,</p>
<p><strong>low angle</strong>: looking up at our trio, Romeo is in the
middle.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: We saved your entire fucking country in World
War Two! Gee…thanks for the statue!</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Quis praesumis profanus apud Dominus?</p>
<p>****: Who dares trespass in the house of God?</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer v.o.</strong>: People are still in shock as
Father McKinney was a beloved local cleric.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer v.o.</strong>: His selfless contributions to
the community too numerous to list. In related news, second generation
crime boss, Concezio Yakavetta has not commented on whether he fears for
his own safety.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Yakavetta?</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: So, there it is. I want everyone to feel
free to share their thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>capo #1</strong>: I can’t believe none of us were consulted
on this! The disrespect! We’d have never okay’d such a thing! A priest!
It’s an infamita!</p>
<p><strong>capo #2</strong>: Yeah! Are we not Catholics, for Christ
fucking sakes?!</p>
<p><strong>capo #3</strong>: And just for simple revenge?! There’s no
business in it! You’ve put us all at risk here! The cops could be all
over us!</p>
<p><strong>capo #4</strong>: Forget the cops! What about these Saints
fuckers?! These guys were long gone! And now you’re trying to bring the
devil right back to our doorstep?!</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Six years ago, with the backing of an
adoring public, these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and
executed him…in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood relative and benefactor to
all of you. Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains
un-revenged…</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: This too, is infamita. These homicidal
maniacs nearly wiped this family out. It’s taken a lot of time to build
ourselves up again, brick by brick. And now that we’ve re-acquiesced our
original power, can we really afford to have these guys pop out of the
woodwork someday and try to finish the job when we least expect it? Now,
for those of you who have forgotten, let’s recap. These fuckers walk
into rooms full of gangsters… Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill
everyone…and leave.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: You think I don’t know that each one of
you’s been waking up in night sweats over this the last couple years?
These sons of bitches prison fucked us with no lube, wiped their dicks
on our drapes and walked away! And we been living in silent fear ever
since. Oh, we don’t talk about it. Rape victims often don’t. But it’s
there. Knowing they’re still out there, somewhere. Thinking…what if?</p>
<p><strong>capo #4</strong>: Concezio is right. Pretending you don’t got
a problem don’t solve nothing.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let’s take a
moment to look at the serendiplious, diperous, serendip…</p>
<p>****: …type situation we find ourselves in here. There’s a good
chance they’ll show. No catching us with our pants down this time. We
can deal with them proactivitously. The cops were embarrassed by these
guys too. With a second bite at the apple, they got every reason in the
world to crank up the heat. And as for their doting public. I’d imagine
they’re gonna lose a few fans.</p>
<p><strong>tattoos</strong>: Murphy’s back has the crucified feet of
Christ and Connor’s shows Christ’s downcast head on the cross.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The prodigal son, huh? He wants us, he’s
fuckin’ got us.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: But why would he do something so public?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Think about it. People figure we did it.
Makes it more likely someone will drop a dime. Way easier to get to us
in prison, isn’t it, now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: But how would anyone recognize us?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You don’t remember those sketches on the
news channel?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Shit. That’s right. Y’know, every time they
show those composites on TV and then they catch the guy, it looks
nothin’ like him. But ours?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin’
Divinci as a sketch artist.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Maybe we should dye our hair.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah. These guys are always dyin’ their
hair. You know, like in “The Fugitive.” It’s covert and shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What color would you dye it?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I don’t know…lighter, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Y’mean…blonde?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I didn’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: California, surfer boy, gay, gay
blonde?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’m warnin’ ya!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Just keep your hands off my ass back there
and, “stay gold, Pony Boy.”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Serves ya right!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I know who you are. You guys are the
fuckin’….</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I’m from
Boston. I love you guys. Shit, everybody does! I mean, holy fucking
shit! Maybe I could get in on this, you know? Bring some La Raza ta this
thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is it true you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: And an awesome wailing was heard throughout
heaven…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: …as the terrible hand of the Lord struck
upon the earth.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: And as Almighty God created you…he now
calleth you home.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Ooops. Busy signal. We’ll hafta calleth
back.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s have a shot while we’re waitin’.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: That shit was NOT funny, man!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I greased my
drawers.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: But I got conex all over Bean Town. Romeo’ll
hook you up like a tow truck!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Why not?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We don’t hafta give you reasons. Forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It’s because I’m Mexican, isn’t it!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How dare you, sir, insinuate such a thing?
The fact that you’re a greasy spic’s got nothin’ ta do with it.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’m gonna let you have that one. Look. I can
do this. It’s not rocket science. You two find bad guys doing bad shit
and you kill them, right?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It’s not that simple.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: S’pose you’re right. I’d sorta hoped we were
a little more artistic than that.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, you ain’t. Can’t you guys see it? This
shit’s fate, man. Like preordained type shit. Mea fucking Culpa! Why do
you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, don’t start gettin’ all super fuckin’
natural on us. We saw those guys goin’ in there!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ah, ha! That’s what you say. I say it’s
because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Fine. Then what exactly do you intend to do
when you hit U.S. soil?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’ll go after all Yakavetta’s people and
operations till we get to the man himself.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah, work our way up the food chain.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So, what’s your first gig? What’s the first
thing you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, I don’t suppose we have a succinct
plan, y’know, per se.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah. It’s not fully developed yet, y’know,
as it were.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: You two need to chill in the green room, sip
on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details. And you
better get my Cub Scout badge ready. Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta
in the nuts, let him know you’re in town…Romeo’s got an ace in the hole
for you.</p>
<p><strong>hot dog vendor</strong>: These guys have gone “mad dog” here.
They need to be put down.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: I think it’s disgusting. I wish they’d
have stayed gone.</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: I don’t believe it for a second! No
bleep-in way the Saints did it!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And that’s all she wrote. Everything points
in the same direction.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Why would Yakavetta want them back here? Him
of all people.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: To have them executed. Revenge. Oldest motive
in the book.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: The Saints killed his daddy six years ago,
right? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for
extortion.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Yeah. From inside he could only do so much.
Since he got out nine months ago, the Yakavetta’s have regained their
original strength. Looks like their clearing all their open
accounts.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Well…it’s a theory.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: More than just a theory, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: C.I.’s came back. Cold hits all around.
Concezio Yakavetta and his six Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: So, it fits. He’s gone to the mattresses
with his top brass. He’s protecting them till this is over.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And word’s been put to all his lieutenants
that the Saints are to be taken out, on sight.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That means his resources on the streets are
battening down the hatches, waiting for them to show.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Look, I been stone walling the media on this
thing but the Mayor’s been riding me like a rented mule here. I got half
of New England thinking the Saints whacked a priest and the other half
thinking their innocent. Its a powder keg. I’m talking riot gear at
Celtics games, here. I could clear them of this murder, take the piss
right out of this thing, keep the peace in the Commonwealth. Gimme one
good reason why I shouldn’t go public right now.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Walk with me, Chief. Let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: This is not good. She’s gunning for the boys
hard.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: This brawd, trying to put a feather in her
cap is gonna get us locked up.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Just calm down.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: And you know they’ll send us to the Hoag.
We put half those deranged sex freaks in there. I hope you guys like
cock sandwiches. Cuz we’ll be eating them for breakfast, lunch and
dinner!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I understand you got a job to do, Chief. But
if Yakavetta even sniffs that we’re onto him, he puts a bullet in
Napoleon’s head, plants him at the bottom of the ocean and walks. This
pint sized killer is the only thing that puts Yakavetta right in the
middle of this. It is imperative that we find this man.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: We need to figure what we’re gonna do when
the boys show and start doin’ what they do best. Cuz that’s when the
shit’s really gonna hit the fan.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: That’s another thing. Everyone’s assuming
that they’re going to come back. I mean, we got no way of knowing that
for sure.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Yeah. That could totally happen. They could
not come back.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What dream world did you two just slip
into?!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Point blank! We know the boys. Is there any
part of you that thinks they’re are just going to let this slide?
Believe this. They are either on their way…or they’re already here.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Connor, Murphy and Romeo peaking over a
concrete wall. Three sets of eyes.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It’s been all over the papers the last two
years. Yakavetta’s in bed with the Chinese. They’re using international
shipping routes to smuggle it in. This is Little Yaka’s shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Let’s follow ’em down the rabbit hole,
Alice.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You just scored a few points, Rome.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, dust off my “Members Only” jacket. Cuz
the kid has also supplied the ride!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I thought you said your car was
inconspicuous.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I don’t like words that got ‘spic’ right in
the middle. Besides, it is…where I live.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where’s that? Pimpville?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Hey! I hail from a colorful people. Besides,
you wouldn’t know style if it pitched a tent in your ass! What do you
think of the ride, Conman?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The only way I could be more embarrassed
right now is if I was ridin’ a moped.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Yeah…while fuckin’ a fat girl.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah…rollin’ through the gym at my high
school reunion.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: All right! I get the fucking point!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Three sets of eyes peaking over oil
drums.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: O’kay, here’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>inside warehouse</strong>: The lift pulls to a stop before
the gangsters, crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and
fire on their Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo
does the “one arm action star hang” off the side of the lift in b.g.
WHIP PAN…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We skin out, go ta Doc’s for a shot of
Irish. We’re home in time for tacos.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, it’s…uh…you know, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It’s genius. I can even drive an F- lift,
man. Got my class “D” license and everything.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Now, dat’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I need a gun.</p>
<p><strong>connor and murphy</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What the fuck? I’m in on this shit, man! I’m
working here!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You can consider yourself a fuckin’ pledge
until we say different.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Can I consider myself your girlfriend,
too?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: That’s what you get. Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t worry, Rome. Shit like this builds
character.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Yeah, the character of a little bitch.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Now, dat’s just unprofessional.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do we think?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I think Yakavetta murdered a good man just
to send us a message.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well…let’s send him one back.</p>
<p><strong>crime scene</strong>: Crime scene workers toil. We do not see
specifics of the scene, just enough to see the place is trashed and the
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Your boss, John Kuntsler called. Tells me you
got a problem with authority.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Absolute horse pucky, Chief. Unfortunately,
authority’s developed a problem with me.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Well, y’see, I am currently in possession of
a vagina.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Oh, Jeez, that’s not…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: So you spoke to Kuntsler. Anything else.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: If it’s confirmed that the Saints are back
and too many bodies start showing up with pocket change… …he’s gonna
pull you and step in.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Message delivered, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Listen. I’ll fend him off. Just work
fast.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: It’s not them.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: It’s them.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: A wise man once told me. Where a man’s
actions are firmly bound to an unshakable faith one’s worst nightmares
become sudden, terrifying reality.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Y’can almost smell the brimstone,
can’tcha?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: What do you think happened here?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Oh, this was a plan that fell to pieces. A
lot here doesn’t make sense which is why it makes perfect sense. I
believe things in our fair little city just got downright biblical.</p>
<p><strong>dock worker</strong>: You didn’t have to bash me in the
skull.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here.
Technically, I was supposed to knock you out.</p>
<p><strong>dock worker</strong>: Christ! You got a gun. You could have
just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!</p>
<p><strong>dock worker</strong>: You got it!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So, let’s not let this one, small incident
get in the way of…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Shut up and get behind the fuckin’
wheel!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, at least the plan is off to a winning
start.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Go fuck y’rself.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It’s heroin.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: How the fuck would you know?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Fuck you. I know shit.</p>
<p><strong>inside crate</strong>: Connor and Murphy are sardined, back
to back.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Jesus! What the fuck’s he doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: He can’t see where he’s goin’!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Shit! Tell him to go left, now!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Go left! Go left!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I can’t fuckin’ believe I let you talk me
into this! This is a stupid plan!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I didn’t notice you throwin’ out any ideas,
ya creative asshole!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Hey! What’s goin’ on in there?!</p>
<p><strong>inside crate</strong>: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he
looks through the crack. They are headed for a “Mechanic’s Well.” A
long, rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!</p>
<p><strong>mechanic’s well</strong>: The brothers burst from the debris,
covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons and
walk toward the ramp at the well’s opposing end.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his
knees and level to the back of his head and recite the following in
synchronicity…</p>
<p><strong>brothers</strong>: And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my
Lord, for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet
may swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we shall flow a river forth to
Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be.</p>
<p><strong>brothers</strong>: In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus
Sancti.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Just got a call from my best snitch. Never
steered me wrong. He says its this guy. “Gorgeous” George Tuffano. He’s
trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood. He’s been left control of
the streets. He’s running all of it.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: They call him “Gorgeous” cuz he likes his
silk suits and jewelry. He’s even got the ‘out of season’ fake bake
going on, a real peacock, this guy.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yeah, I heard of this rodeo clown.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Ballistics just dug it out.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: A twenty two? You gotta be kidding me.
That’s like bringing a knife to a gunfight.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Yeah, or like bringing a really small
gun…to a gunfight.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I don’t know. Ballistics is reading three
shooters. This is one of them.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Well, I’m having a hard time believing that
one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched
over to bird shot.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Maybe we’re reading it wrong. The priest was
a frame job, right?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Yeah, maybe somebody’s trying to eliminate
some competition here.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: No, sir. It’s them. But we just might have
ourselves a change in the line up, here.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Fine, they’re back. What’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Hell, we’ve just been called up to the big
show. We are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen. The plan? We
keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where Yakavetta’s
hiding. Napoleon. We find him and flip him. And as for the Saints…I’m
gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Holy…fucking…shit.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: small black and white TV on table.
Breaking news. Live from the crime scene…</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Law enforcement has confirmed the
Saints are back!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1 v.o.</strong>: It’s confirmed. The five drug
traffickers all involved in the heroin trade were victims of the
Saints.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2 v.o.</strong>: …several having close ties to the
Yakavetta Crime Family, confirming the long suspected merger of the
Chinese Triad and the Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A metal door opens revealing DOC .</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I saw da nuh, nuh, news
channel. Are ya boys all right?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Sound as an Irish pound, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Is it too late for a shot?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Oh, the Lord told me you’d be comin! He said,
“Doc, they’re comin” and I was ta get everting ready. So I did.
Everting’s ruh, ruh, ruh, it’s all set.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Uh, hem!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Oh, this is our Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How are ya, lad? They call me…FUCK!…ASS!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nice to meet you, Fuck Ass, I’m Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>the brothers</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The place used ta be an old speak easy in the
forties. I only use it for storage, now.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: This is so fucking cool.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Nobody even knows it’s up here. You’ll be
safe.</p>
<p>****: You can get in and out the fu-fu-fire escape.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: You know what this is? This is our hide out,
man! We got a hide out!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What are you, fucking five years old?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hey, Rome, we got sheets and broomsticks.
You could build yourself a fort.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Fuck the both of you!</p>
<p>****: Not this time, ya little shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’ll see, old man.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Would somebody please come over here
and…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: …me up the…</p>
<p><strong>ass!</strong>: The boys and Romeo burst into hysterics. Doc
rages.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, yeah. Someone’s been eating their
Wheaties. Yeah, get after it, girl.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You fucking bitch!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: What did you just call me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Why, I’m a lady, George. That fact alone
demands a certain amount of… …cordiality.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m, I’m sorry I called you that.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Well, how courteous of you to apologize.
Courtesy is so important. Don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Y, yeah…I’m with that.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Good. Now sit your fat ass down.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Where is…Concezio Yakavetta?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yeah. There’s a lot of stuff you don’t know,
Hoss. For instance, why aren’t you safely tucked away in some ivory
tower with all the other big wigs, sucking on cannoli and shrimp
cocktail? Why are you the one he left on the streets, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Someone’s gotta run our legitimate
businesses. Someone’s gotta make sure that…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Someone’s gotta chum the waters.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s bullshit and I ain’t saying another
fucking word to you.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Good. Then you can just listen. The jig is
up. We know Concezio had that priest killed.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Oh, surprise, surprise. Another thing you
don’t know, I reckon. But why would he tell you? You and your guys on
the streets, you’re his bait. Y’all just got thrown into a meat
grinder.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Gorgeous George, huh? Expendable George is
more like it.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: By the by, you got a pretty nice ass for a
fat man.</p>
<p><strong>romeo v.o.</strong>: You wanna find something in Boston that
don’t wanna be found you go to the Oracle, ese. My Uncle Cesar is hooked
up with the Underground.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Word is, Yakavetta’s gunning for you boys
hard. The whole city’s on edge. I even heard he posted a reward like
Jesse James style and shit. Any of his guys that take you out gets his
palm crossed, two hundred and fifty grand.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Whew. A quarter of a mill for us?</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Us? What the fuck are you talking about
“us?”</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Uncle, why do you have to disrespect me in
front of them?!</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you were
washing my pots and pans!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Well, I don’t wash fucking pots anymore! I’m
part of this, Uncle!</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Hey! This isn’t my first bar-b-que! Now shut
up and stop interrupting! Let me talk to them and I’ll figure out
whether your in on this or in your own fucking fantasy world!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He’s in. All the way in.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Is my nephew pulling his weight?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Mucho corazon.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: Gorgeous George is running the show for
Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution, sharking, the whole cha cha. If
anybody knows where he is, it’s that fat fucking pedico. I’ll put it out
on the wire.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Hey, uh, maybe we should…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Shut up. Romeo’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: You fucking assholes!</p>
<p><strong>capo #5</strong>: That shipment of “H” was gonna square our
books for six months. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>capo #6</strong>: We always bounce back. Besides, look at the
bright side. Better the chinks than us, right.</p>
<p><strong>capo #5</strong>: I guess. Like the boss said… “This is war.
There’s gonna be casuwalities.”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here! Where’s
all the concubines and shit?</p>
<p><strong>capo #3</strong>: George. What gives, here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I need to see the Boss, right away.</p>
<p><strong>capo #4</strong>: Jimmy the Gofer!</p>
<p><strong>capo #2</strong>: Il cortina.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Get over here!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh. Hey, Boss! I just came by to…!</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Push the talk button, numb nuts.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Can you here me? Over.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: I can hear you fine, Smokey and the
Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Everything’s in motion. All our guys are
gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I figure, no need for me to be on the
streets no more. So, which room do I take, eh?</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: You stupid motherfucker! I told you,
you’re on the streets till this is over! Now get the fuck outta
here!</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: And don’t come back here till I tell you
to, you fat fucking waste of space!</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: A priest. The sick fuck.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And he leaves all of us on the streets
holding the bag while him and his are living it up at the Taj fuckin’
Majal, not a care in the world.</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: So, until the Saints get popped, we’re all
lambs to slaughter?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah! And he don’t care how many of us they
wipe out in the meantime!</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: What do you need me to do, Skipper?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Spread the word to all the brugliones. No
bullshit. From your mouth to their ears.</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: Everyone? North and South? That could get a
little dicey.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fuck their old grudges. All of them are in
this, like it or not. Tell them everything we discussed.</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: Even the panic room thing?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: Good. That’s a nice ice breaker. They’ll get
a kick outta that. I didn’t even know those things were real. I thought
they made that shit up for that movie? With that brawd and that kid?
With those guys in that house?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Panic Room?</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: Naw, the other one.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stop fuckin’ around! This is serious shit,
here! Tell ’em we meet tomorrow night. I’ll call you with the
location.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Tap’s up and running on George’s cell.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Rosary bead. They found it pushed into the
carpet near the victim. Father McKinney wasn’t wearing a rosary so it’s
probably been there a while.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: The results on all 864 prints found at the
scene. All match churchgoers or clergy but one. The partial on the
priest’s watch is still unidentified.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: That’s horse shit. Everyone gets printed
nowadays. They’re inking up snotgobblers in kindergarten, now.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: It’s a brick wall anyway. We know Napoleon
was wearing gloves. Lab got zilch off the chain and lock. The pennies
came up clean too.</p>
<p>****: I’m gonna go powder my nose.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Aw, man. Daddy would knock that out like
Mike Tyson.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: What?! I didn’t say nothing!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: McKinney wore his watch on his left
hand.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Where was this found exactly?!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Right here, off his left elbow. Where are you
going with this?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Dolly, get on the phone! Find out which
wrist he wore his rosary on and if he was wearing it that night! Duffy,
run that partial through DMV! David put it through INTERpol! Just get an
I.D.! Now! Come on! Vamoose!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You took your glove off, didn’tcha Cowboy.
Now, why would you go and do a damn fool thang like that?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the…did they use his mug shot?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What? No.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You remember how he told us he was
embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up all his long hair behind his
head?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’s an arm.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh…that’s fuckin’ harsh.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Y’er one of a kind, Roc.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: So, am I as good as this guy, or what?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Holy shit! HOLY SHIT! You’re
the Saints! I’m Roy, it’s an honor. Huge fan!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’re developin’ quite the cult following in
the old neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Que pasa.</p>
<p><strong>cesar</strong>: I got that info you wanted, mijo.</p>
<p><strong>cesar v.o.</strong>: The place is Tropical Tan on Bunker
Hill. It’s where the fat fucking juedo gets his fake bake at. He’s got a
secret appointment. Once a week, never misses. Eight o’clock,
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: We got him.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Who’s this, your new sidekick? Pleased to meet
you. I’m Roy.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: How would you like me to sidekick you in the
ass, Roy?</p>
<p>****: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I, I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’m sick of this shit! I’ve been breaking my
balls, here and I get second banana billing! I…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I, I, I. There is no “I” in team, ya selfish
prick.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Yeah?! Well, there’s an “I” in “Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Lovely voice. We’d like ya ta sing for us.
What do ya say?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s getting hard to be a fucking gentleman
of leisure, here!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We want the shooter you motherfuckers used
on that priest.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s the truth! Concezio didn’t tell no one
what he was doing cuz he knew nobody would have o’kay’ed it! The
shooter’s an independent contractor! That’s all I know!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Where’s Yakavetta hidin’?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The Prudential! Fortieth floor! Jesus
Christ!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You meeting someone tonight, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah. The brugliones.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yakavetta’s racket chiefs. Street guys. Your
kind of guys. You could take a real bite outta crime here, huh? I could
help you.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Nobody forgot what you guys did to us last
time. They’re staying indoors. I give out the location an hour
before.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: My Uncle’s place is closed tonight. I got the
key.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s down by the docks. Dead as a doornail
at night.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah. You could set off fourth of July
fireworks in dat place and nobody would hear. How’s Mexican for you,
George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No difference to me. I think I just shit my
Speedos, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: How do, David?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial.
INTERpol’s still working it. Should only be another couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Lovely. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a text
message from George’s cell. Just two words. “El Cava.” It’s a Mexican
joint down by the docks. He sent it to his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess
gangsters gotta eat too, huh?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I think I’ll drop in on their supper, see if
I can shake them up a little.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: You need a body guard?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: No thank you, Mike Tyson. Bye now.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just two more to go. Uh…You guys are gonna
let me go, right?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’ll see, won’t we.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #1</strong>: Yo, spicaroo. More nachos and mas
salsa, capisce?</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #1</strong>: Hey and I need a refill there,
pepe?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Si, muchachos.</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #3</strong>: Whoa! Easy…Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: These dagos are getting antsy and I’m getting
Spicaroo’d and Pepe’d. The kid’s about to go Poncho fucking Villa out
there!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Stick it out. Waitin’ on one more.</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: He is not with them.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Are you certain?</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Yes. It is only the sons. They have a
Spaniard with them. They will slaughter everyone.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Let them. If you kill the sons…the father
will come.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The gang’s all here.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Naw. You’ve earned your stripes, Rome.</p>
<p><strong>jo jo</strong>: So….where’s Gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #2</strong>: What the fuck is going on,
here?</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #2</strong>: Where’s that spic barkeep? Yo,
Pepe! Where you at?!</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #3</strong>: “Erin go brah?” What the hell
does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s Irish for “You’re fucked.”</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Viva La Mejico, bitches!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Uh, I’ve seen the light! You guys have
really turned me around on this! I’m like born again and shit! I
swear!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What do ya think? Let him go?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: We’ll let God decide if you get a second
chance.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, praise the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: George? All good boys go to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Now, that was, perhaps the finest example of
spiritual guidance that I have ever had the good fortune ta witness.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Well, thank you very much. Mysterious ways.
Mysterious ways.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen
door and levels her weapon at the brothers and Romeo. Romeo levels
back.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Drop the gun! Drop it!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Easy fellas. I’m alone.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Who are ya?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: My name is Eunice Bloom…and I’m your new
guardian angel. A torch was passed to me by a mutual friend, gone but
not forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We heard about Smecker. He was a good
man.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Aye. You have our condolences.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And you have mine.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Very well…Connor, Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Who the fuck was that guy?!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: That, I suspect, was the shooter you boys
have been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Fucking…what the fuck?! Who the fuck is this
brawd?! And what the fuck’s going on, here?!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Let’s speed this up before your new
sidekick’s got to dig any deeper into his impressive vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, no you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I am an FBI agent who is controlling this
investigation from within, in order to ensure that you gentlemen never
see the inside of a prison cell. I am conspiring to do this with three
like minded individuals who have aided you in the past. Though I have
yet to inform them of my agenda because, well, girl’s gotta have her
fun.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Dolly, Duffy and Greenly?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The very same.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How are the lads?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Two of them are scared. One’s just
horny.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Bet’cha I can guess which one.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Bet’cha can but let’s save it for group.
Right now, we have a big problem.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: This…simply won’t do. We made a deal. The
big fish step in if your body count gets too high and… …you have been
very naughty boys.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: O’kay. Here’s how it all went down.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: A secret gathering of the Brugliones. The
topic of discussion? Weak leadership and betrayal.</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #1</strong>: Yakavetta’s hiding from these
Jesus Freaks and making us look like pussies.</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #1</strong>: And he’s hanging all of us out to
dry to boot.</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #2</strong>: All right. I’ll be the first to
say it.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: The enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, even
with all their old vendettas…</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #2</strong>: …I say fuck the Yakavettas.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And there it is. Guess what comes next.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Red Rover. Red Rover.</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #2</strong>: We’re taking over.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Ah. Easier uttered than accomplished. The
North End and the South End may as well be the Hetfields and the McCoys.
These fellas…they just don’t get on.</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #3</strong>: Fuck you! The North End built
that racket from the ground up!</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #3</strong>: South End’s been carrying your
fucking asses for years!</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #3</strong>: 15 percent?! In your dreams,
asshole!</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #3</strong>: Whoa! Just went up to twenty,
fuck stick!</p>
<p><strong>s.s. bruglione #1</strong>: You want some of this, you
mutt?!</p>
<p><strong>n.s. bruglione #1</strong>: Let’s see what you got!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Oh, the cliche. A Mexican stand off in a
Mexican restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: They cut each other to pieces…and nobody
walked away. Who knows who fired first. Could have been any one of them.
But somebody let it loose. And duck, duck, duck…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Goose.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yakavetta’s lost control of the streets.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: They’re fighting over his throne. This was
not the work of the Saints.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: INTERpol came through.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: You were right. Five foot five. Gotta be
the shooter.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Are you ready for your fifteen minutes,
Sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: That ain’t all. Short stuff’s work visa was
signed by a sponsor that doesn’t exist and look at the date. Two months
after Nine Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Someone maneuvered it through the system
using false information during the highest alert in U.S. history.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Yakavetta’s just a gangster. He ain’t got the
juice to pull that off.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You’re darn tootin’ he don’t.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: INS red flagged it like a motherfucker.
It’s a shit storm.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Something stanks like manure.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: We got someplace to be! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: What is this? Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: It’s time to revisit the scene of the
crime.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: It’s after hours. I mean, if you wanted a
drink then…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: 37 bodies later and we’re finally back where
it all began. Y’ever heard of the southern expression, “We have an
elephant in the living room?”</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Hope you fellas brought some peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You knew all along.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What? Ya don’t call. Ya don’t write.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’m glad we got the band back together…
…even though our new bass player’s kind of a retard.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So, where’d you learn ta shoot like
that?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: My Daddy was an old six gun shooter. A real
cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Guess that makes you a cowgirl, eh? Thanks.
Saved our asses.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Don’t mention it. Now, we have a little
business to go over before you celebrate in earnest.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This is the guy?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: That’s the guy. He’s a Sicilian immigrant,
name of Ottilio Panza.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Five, five? He’s short bastard isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yes…and well put. He’ll be front page news
in the morning but we have to assume Yakavetta already knows we’ve ID’d
his guy. We can’t give him time to ‘Plan B’ us.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We’re hittin’ him tomorrow night. Dat soon
enough?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Should be. Where’s it gonna happen?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The Pru.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: The Prudential Building? What are you,
cracked?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Why don’t you just do it on center ice at a
fucking Bruin’s game?!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Dat’s where the man is so dat’s where we’re
goin’. No guts no glory, Green Beans.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: In fact, we could use a few extra hands…that
is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Hey, I got balls for days, pally. I’m a
fucking sack-o-matic.</p>
<p><strong>dolly and duffy</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Well, you boys have fun. Connor, Murphy?
Escort a lady to the door?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Y’sure you don’t wanna hear the plan? I’m
not tryin’ ta brag or nothin’ but this one’s a real Picasso.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aw, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: School night. Got some homework to do.
Besides, I’d like to critique your masterpiece with a fresh eye.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Something ain’t right with this whole thing.
Panza knew you were in there tonight and he just let it happen. Didn’t
lift a finger. I mean, if he’s working for Yakavetta, why would he stand
by and just watch all his guys get taken out?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That is…interestin’.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You think maybe we got another fox in the
hen house here?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Starting ta look that way. Somebody pushed
that visa through. Could have ourselves a gen-u-ine ‘Ghost in the
Darkness,’ here.</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: They still live…What if he does not come?
What if…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Shhhhh. He will come.</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: Expanded my operation, since I saw ya
last. Word got out who may or may not have outfitted ya. Turns out ya
got quite the underground followin’.</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
select from my private reserve.</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: If I may make a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I feel like that kid who found the gold
ticket in the candy bar in “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.”</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Yeah…Charlie. And I want an Oompa Loompa
now, Daddy, now.</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: Full accessory packages. I’m sure you’ll
find them useful.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’ll take these.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Have you been crying again?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Yeah! Tears of joy! How much?</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: You guys are on the house.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Are you saying I look gay?!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No. You just hail from a colorful…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: You don’t know me. You think these make me
look gay?</p>
<p><strong>gun dealer</strong>: You look like you might have seen one up
close.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Evidence?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Foolish, arrogant boy! What have you
done?!</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: That wiley old fox not as clever as we
thought. Or maybe he played me from the git. Y-you think he played
me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Uh, Boss. Maybe you aught not to be telling
me this stuff. I’m just…</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: A little sensitivity, huh? You heartless
cocksucker! I need to vindicate my feelings here! I can’t tell those
goombas outside! They’ll serve up my balls over a plate of fucking
spaghetti!</p>
<p><strong>capo #4</strong>: Fuck that. We got a mutiny on our hands.
Every ten cent wanna be with a gun is moving on us all over town.</p>
<p><strong>capo #3</strong>: Yeah and our fearless leader ain’t even
come out of his little pussy room yet.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: I want each of you to call your top button
man. The best you got. I want them all here tonight. We rip this city a
new asshole. It’s time for us to reconnoiter our strength on the
streets. We seize the day starting now…Carpel Tunnel, gentlemen, Carpel
Tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>capo #5</strong>: Glad to see you back among the living,
Boss.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: God speed.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Out with it! What the hell’s the matter with
ya?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Nothing! It’s just…this is some heavy
shit.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Ya did fine at your uncle’s place.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Yeah, but we’re going off a new script here.
I’m just having a…period of adjustment.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You’re about to have a period of gettin’ yer
ass beat!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Hey! You two ain’t the only ones rollin’ with
no health insurance! Just let me do my thing. I’m absorbing this.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This is not the time for you to be absorbin’
shit! Now, if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns
at ’em and fer Christ sakes, at least try ta look cool!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I thought you were all hot fer dis!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Oh, I’m hot! I’m fucking red hot! The kid’s
flamin’ like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: This is you. Be on time.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You ready fer dis shit, my dear brother?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Let’s do some gratuitous violence.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: On a sultry Saturday in September the Saints
saved seventeen souls…try saying that five times fast.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Come on. There’s nothing to be afraid of.
It’s all over.</p>
<p>****: He won’t come out.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Special Agent Bloom! You are hereby
relieved of all obligation to this investigation.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: That’s right, kids. This crime scene is
now under the full jurisdiction of your beloved federal government. As
of now, you will all report to me, Special Agent John Kuntsler.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Don’t let us interrupt you. Just don’t
forget to turn over everything you find. We have people standing by
ready to take credit for all your hard work.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: So, how ya doin’, Bloomy?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Just fine…Cunty.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Nice little science project you got going
with these three goofballs. You trying to turn them into your own little
junior G-men? Well, you can put sprinkles on shit, Bloom, but it’s still
shit. So, you and your Keystone Cops can all go home now and let the
professionals handle this?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Boy. I’d love to hear a gen-u-wine
professional’s assessment of a crime scene. How ’bout you,
detectives?</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: O’kay. Seems pretty obvious. The door was
broken down. We’ve got our point of entry. The assailants fired in this
direction.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Explains the windows. The victims
were…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: There are three inaccuracies in what you
just said. Number one, David.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: If the windows were shattered by gunfire
coming from inside the room, the glass would have been blown outward. As
you can see, most of it is on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Number two, Dolly.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Blood splatters in the direction of the
rounds fired. If the assailants discharged toward the windows, the blood
would follow suit. Here, the majority of splatter is in the opposing
direction.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Number three, Duffy.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Trick question. There is no number three. He
only fucked up twice.</p>
<p>****: Looks like Bloomy aced her science project.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: That was just off the…I would have seen
the blood thing…I haven’t even had time to…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Why don’t you let me take a crack at it,
John? Won’t cost you nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: And just why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Cuz, tonight…mamma’s right on time.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: This evening’s topic of discussion?
Desperate times require desperate measures.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Desperate times require…some, you know,
some desperate shit. Starting tonight, every one of you fat fucking
slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Shut the fuck up! We got no choice. You
motherfuckers better get in touch with your ‘inner gangster’. It’s time
to knock the dust off your ball bats! You break bones! You smash heads!
You do whatever you gotta do!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Which brings us to the relevance of our new
guests.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: Each one of you is to stick to the guy
that called you here like glue. You arm yourselves to the teeth, pick
your own crews. These bible banging psychos will make an attempt. It’s
your job to blow their souless hearts out of their chests.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: It’s time to reclaim the streets with an
iron fist.</p>
<p><strong>concezio</strong>: We gotta take back what’s ours with some
sincere ironfistery.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Let’s explain the glass, now. Why is most of
it inside the room?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Here’s why…or it will be “why” in a moment.
Y’see, these boys. Well, to put it simply, they tend to get reeeeal…</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Creative! It’s a creative plan!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: It’s ridiculous! Probably based on some
stupid shit ya saw in a movie! And here I am AGAIN all tyin’ myself up
with rope! What is the deal with you and rope?! Honestly!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It happens ta be a useful thing!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: You didn’t get this from a movie…did you?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: The “Eiger Sanction,” Clint Eastwood! And it
worked like a fucking charm for him!</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: O’kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane,
apartment 3C. Lovely wife and kids. How old are they? Nevermind. Here’s
the situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin’ to
do some killin’ here tonight. I’m talking bullets and blood,
custom-wholesale slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O? Good. Now, I’ve
run into a little snag. I need to figure out a tag line. You know,
something cool to say when it’s all over like…“I’ll be back,” but mine,
y’know? I need to own this one. I think this’ll help me get through the
quote, unquote event. I’m going to take your gag off and you and me are
going to riff a little, o’kay? Let’s have fun with this.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I can’t believe you! I’m a fucking janitor.
What do I know about bullets and slaughter and shit?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an “Hasta La
Vista” line, toute fucking suite and you’re gonna help me think of
one!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And you can count on it like the U.S. mail.
Through rain, sleet, hail or snow…something always seems to go wrong for
these poor sons o’ guns.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: I don’t know! It just stopped!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Well, get it fuckin’ goin’ again!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: It won’t turn back on! It just died!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: How much time?!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Sixty Seconds!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We gotta go now!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: What are you talking about!?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: If we’re even a few seconds late, Romeo’s
dead! We gotta go! We’re down thirteen stories!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Eleven more to go! Ball park it!</p>
<p><strong>brothers</strong>: One floor, two, three…</p>
<p>****: The fuckin’ Eiger Sanction.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Uh…“Take that, suckers!”</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Not cool enough.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Uh, “Merry Christmas, mother fuckers!”</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Too sacrilegious.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Oh God, uh, how about “Eat it!”</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: What are we at, a buffet, now?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Good God, man! I’m a…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Hang on, you might be onto something with the
buffet thing, like with food, y’know? Let’s brainstorm on that idea for
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: One…thing has always amazed me.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: How quiet it gets. You ever noticed that?
It’s hard to imagine that just a few hours ago, it was the God damn O.K.
coral in here.</p>
<p><strong>fantasy sequence</strong>: Cool Country Western music!</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A pair of cowboy boots pacing toward.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: One thang I’m gon guarantee ya…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: We gon have us a good time…</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: …in the old barn tonight!</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Two bullet holes pierce the windows behind
Eunice as she levels her Colts. The mammoth panes shatter but stay in
the frame.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: All gangsters bolt upright as their plasma
screen explodes with the boys’ rounds. Some pull weapons.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The brothers smash through the glass. They
fire as they swing over Eunice’s head.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut
their ropes in mid air with the Rambo knives. The brothers land on their
knees. Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the
table.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Eunice runs along the table top, crushing
food and keeping pace with the boys as all three let the led out.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The gangsters and button men return fire in
chaos.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over
furniture, into walls. Romeo blasts. Slow motion gun battle.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room. At the
last second, Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in. The door
slides shut.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my Lord,
for Thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our feet may
swiftly carry out Thy command.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee and
teeming with souls shall it ever be.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus
Sancti.</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: “Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?”</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Whup ass fajita?</p>
<p><strong>connor and murphy</strong>: That’s fuckin’ stupid.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Hold up, now.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Was that the best you could do?</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: It’s just…I couldn’t think…I</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Shhhhhh. Ya broke down the door,
didn’tcha?</p>
<p><strong>quick cut</strong>: He breaks down the door. QUICK CUT: The
brothers shoot Yakavetta. QUICK CUT: Romeo, guns up and once more with
feeling…</p>
<p><strong>romeo</strong>: Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You said it.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: And that, gentlemen…is the sound of the fat
lady singin’.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Should we…clap or something?</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Eunice! Oh, shit! Eunice!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I will
kill you! Do you fucking hear, me? I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Get a hostage negotiator down here and put
some stank on it! He could be in there all…touching her and shit!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I wasn’t gonna hurt
you!</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You bet your ass you weren’t.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Just lemme explain. I have information, like
pertinent information. Ouch! Look, I was listening to you out there and
that’s, like, exactly what happened. That’s what made me think you were
the person to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Yakavetta had a partner, didn’t he.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You saw this fella?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. It was only one time and just for a
second but I think I could ID him. I don’t know his name, though.
Concezio always called him the “Old Man” accept one time when he called
him something else, like he fucked up and I wasn’t supposed ta hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He called him…the Roman.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Did this little motherfucker…?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Easy, David. I’m fine. C’mon gents, we’re
leaving. This is the Fed’s problem, now.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Hey! What happened in there? What was said
to you, Agent?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: You got him in custody. Ask him yourself.
You’re the professional.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Yeah, professional moron.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: I got no idea. That’s just weird. The Roman?
What do you think it means?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: Feels like our ghost ta me.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: What do we do now? I mean, the brothers ain’t
goin’ nowhere until we get Panza or they do.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: We’ve all had enough excitement for one
night. Let’s sleep on it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: When’s Romeo returnin’ to the “hide
out?’</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Soon as he’s done apologizin’ to his uncle
for wreckin’ his restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: And he should be sorry. The disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hold your damn horses!</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Sack-o-matic, I said!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I got nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: One in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Boys!</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Put dem down! Throw dem over!</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Throw dem over!</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Brothers, eh? Which one first? This one?
Dee other, eh?</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves
to Crew Cut with a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Doc! Call da fuckin’ ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Where is the Old Man?</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Just hold on.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Hang in there, brother. They’re comin’.</p>
<p><strong>greenly</strong>: Naw, boys…it’s over. Don’t worry…proudest

<p><strong>brothers</strong>: Da!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Easy, boys.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the fuck’s he doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jesus christ!</strong>: Connor rushes over and grabs up the
shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: I’m gonna blow this mother fucker’s brains
out, right now!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Son…Daddy’s workin’.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p>****: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>crew cut</strong>: Make me famous.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: I’m so sorry, boys. This is all my
fault.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What are ya talkin’ about, Da?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: I was an immigrant to the U.S. in 1958. I
was sixteen. I came to New York where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a
cobbler.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Had a little shop and I was to learn the
family business. Mafia was everywhere in those days.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: Simple extortion…protection money. But
your grandfather was proud.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I can’t help ya with dat, lads. Ya got
problems with your shoes, I’d be happy to have a look, got fair
prices.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: I just…watched.</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Il ochio de dio! We gotta call the polizia,
Noah! We gotta call somebody!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: I buried my father, then I buried the
men who killed him. Louie, my best friend, helped me…</p>
<p><strong>thug #3</strong>: Come on, kid. It was an accident. We can
work dis out. Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>thug #4</strong>: He ain’t gonna do shit. I’ll take two.</p>
<p><strong>thug #3</strong>: What da fuck’s da matter with you? Can’t
you see…</p>
<p><strong>thug #4</strong>: I see just fine. Deal.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: You’re Italian, kid. Help us out here. Put
one in the back of his head and you get anything you want!</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: I, I, I…am his friend.</p>
<p><strong>thug #4</strong>: Fuck him and fuck his friend. Deal the
cards! He ain’t got the balls.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: It started out slowly. Just the ones
who were a threat to us.</p>
<p><strong>mafioso #1</strong>: Come on, kid. It’s good for you, good
for us. We’ll move it right out the back of the place.</p>
<p><strong>mafioso #2</strong>: It’ll never touch you. You got the word
of the Bonnavese family on that.</p>
<p><strong>mafioso #1</strong>: What’s da matter with you, eh?</p>
<p>****: Easy, Noah…easy friend.</p>
<p><strong>mafioso #2</strong>: What are you, stupid or something?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Then one day…</p>
<p><strong>louie</strong>: Why should we not help others who suffer
these Mafia thugs?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: Then it began.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: Louie would pick the marks and plan
everything in detail.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: And I would go in and do the jobs.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: I would execute, over and over again,
those who had taken my father from me.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: So it went for years.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: So…how’d ya end up inside, Da?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Back in ‘75, I did a hit, came out and the
police were waitin’ for me. He set me up, 25 to life.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Wait…why did he set you up?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Can’t wait ta ask him.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Why didn’t ya flip on him? Cut down yer
time? The guy fucked ya.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: He’d learned of the birth of my sons.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Do you know Louie’s full name?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Aye.</p>
<p><strong>duffy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: It’s me. Put Eunice on.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I hope they do it slow…you piece of
shit.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: An old time phone being carried to a rear
table.</p>
<p><strong>patronazzi</strong>: Si.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Hello, old friend.</p>
<p><strong>patronazzi</strong>: Many years. Are you in need?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes. I am making marinara and alas, I have
run out of tomatoes. To help an old friend…how many can you spare?</p>
<p><strong>patronazzi</strong>: I am in good supply of tomatoes.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Come on. The game’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Funny thing about the Red Sox. We never gave
up hope, y’know? It’s what kept us going all those years. And they did
it. They finally fuckin’ did it. What are we all gonna do now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: I lost a lot of money on ’em. But I gotta
admit. Always felt better…betting the underdogs.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: So, how’s things going?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Yeah. I know. It’s rough having your faith
shaken.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: But it happens to all of us.</p>
<p>****: You know what’s always tripped me out? How hundreds of years
ago, a bunch of desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships, crossed the ocean
blue. They had no clue what was on the other side of it. Took real
balls. But they sailed into infinity and made it all the way to the
shores of the New fucking World… …and all they had was their faith. I’m
always surprised how so many people miss the simple fact that faith…is
the reason all of us are even here. You can’t underestimate the power of
it. Shit, you were the ones that taught me that.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: Listen, your my boys so I’m gonna give you
some inside. The Sox are gonna do it again this year. The line in Vegas
is huge. Put everything you got on it.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Maybe we should.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: You’re sure, Roc? You know this?</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: No…I just have faith. And for a second there,
you almost did too. Y’see, it’s contagious. And if enough people catch
it…look out, baby.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: While the wicked stand confounded…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: …call me with Thy Saints surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: He lives in York Maine. About 30 minutes
from here. Better go quick. I logged on to an FBI database to get the
info. Homeland Security does internal monitoring now. Only a matter of
time before they flag it.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Will they know it’s you? Will you be all
right, dear?</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I hear Costa Rica’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>eunice</strong>: I never thought I’d ask this of another
human being but please…kill this man.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: It ends taday.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Anybody word from Bloom, yet?</p>
<p><strong>g-man #2</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: I want that little Bayou Bitch in here.
Something stinks about this whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>g-man #2</strong>: I’m having D.H.S. dump her IP and check
for flags. See if she’s been poking around.</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: This is S.A.I.C., Jonathan Buford
Kuntsler! Security code A4153B! I need an immediate R2 law enforcement
override clearance!</p>
<p><strong>federal operator v.o.</strong>: What is your specific
request, Agent?</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Everyone in the tri-state area with a
gun!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Hello, Louie.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Noah.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: We haven’t much time.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: My garden. She is beautiful, yes? Ah, but
you. You are blind to beauty. You are a destroyer, Noah.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: You know my reasons. You know why I did
what I did.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: But do you? You think it was for your father?
No. You were born a killer. Death…is in the very blood that runs through
your veins.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Then explain this.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: You were not there to raise them. Not a
single day. Yet, how closely they follow in the footsteps of their
father. They have inherited your blood, Noah…your anger.</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Remember, not a scratch on the Old Man.</p>
<p><strong>thug #6</strong>: Got it. Wait for the signal.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: And you? What are you?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: I am a creator. You see? Our very natures
stood in opposition as old as the story of the scorpion and the
frog.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Why…did you sell me out, Louie?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: You can never understand.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: 25 years….try me.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: I wanted to join with them. They were
building an empire. Creating something and I was helping them! I used
you, Noah, to eliminate their problems, to destroy their competition, to
cut out their cancers. I earned my place among them.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Is this your place among them? Because all
I see is a an old man, sitting in a garden.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Alas, the scorpion and the frog both lost
everything, yes? I should have paid more attention to the story.</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Without you…I was no longer useful to them.
They cast me out!</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: The location is to be surrounded and
secured upon arrival! Nobody goes in!</p>
<p><strong>kuntsler</strong>: Are those fucking news choppers?!</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Why the priest, Louie? Why all this? Why,
now?</p>
<p><strong>roman</strong>: Because I knew it would bring you and your
sons. You would destroy the Yakavettas and clear my way. This time, I
will take what is rightfully mine. Just a little piece, for my old age.
After all, I have never been a greedy man.</p>
<p><strong>thug #6</strong>: That’s it! Move!</p>
<p><strong>bird’s eye view</strong>: Looking down on Connor and Murphy.
They rapid fire their huge .50 cals through the wall.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The heavy rounds blast through the wall and
massacre the three Thugs as they are about to exit.</p>
<p><strong>connor and murphy</strong>: Da?</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: Boys. Help me up.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: I’ll see you in a minute, Louie.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: Oh, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m</strong>: It’s a beautiful day.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Aye. It is…it is, Da.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: And shepherds we shall be…</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: …for Thee, my Lord, for Thee…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: the boys move toward the front door.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: Power hath descended forth from Thy
hand…</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: …that our feet may swiftly carry out
thy command…</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: So, we shall flow a river forth to
Thee…</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: …and teeming with souls shall it ever
be…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The boys stop in the middle of the lawn and
look out over the massive presence. A policeman yells in his bullhorn,
m.o.s.</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo, close on</strong>: The brothers’ guns fall to the
grass.</p>
<p><strong>poppa m v.o.</strong>: In Nomini Patri…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The brothers drop to their knees.</p>
<p><strong>connor</strong>: …e fili…</p>
<p><strong>slo-mo</strong>: The brothers put their hands behind their
heads.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: …e Spiritu Sancti.</p>
<p><strong>subtext</strong>: “Seven days Later”</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: …hundreds took off work today to say
good bye to the man Boston is calling simply, “The Father.”</p>
<p><strong>sally mcbride</strong>: …still in a coma. The condition of
Romeo Mata, the young Hispanic American allegedly operating with the
Saints remains critical.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: …the search continues for missing
Special Agent Eunice Bloom. As of yet, law enforcement has turned up
nothing but have not ruled out foul play.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: The young men, who’s names Police are
not releasing to the public have yet to utter a word since their
capture. Even to their court appointed attorneys.</p>
<p><strong>ballplayer</strong>: It doesn’t change anything. What they
did is still more important. It’s still the issue.</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: They deserve medals.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: They deserve the death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>priest v.o.</strong>: Only God can judge!</p>
<p><strong>actor v.o.</strong>: Oh, save it for group, father!</p>
<p><strong>ballplayer</strong>: Well, I know this! They certainly don’t
belong in prison.</p>
<p><strong>host v.o.</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>host v.o.</strong>: Maybe that’s just the place for them.</p>
