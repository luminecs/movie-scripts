<p><strong>costello</strong>: I don’t want to be a product of my
environment. I want my environment to be a product…of me.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Years ago, we had the Church. That was
only a way of saying we had each other. The Knights of Columbus were
head-breakers. They took over their piece of the city.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Twenty years after an Irishman couldn’t
get a job, we had the presidency. That’s what the niggers don’t realize.
If I got one thing against the black chaps it’s this. No one gives it to
you. You have to take it.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: Don’t make me have to come down here
again.</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: Won’t happen again, Mr. C.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: Carmen’s developing into a fine
young lady. You should be proud. You get your period yet, Carmen?</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: You Johnny Sullivan’s kid?</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: You live with your grandmother?</p>
<p><strong>young colin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Get him three loaves of bread. And a
couple of half gallons of milk. And some soup.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Do you like comic books?</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: You do good in school?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: That’s good. I did good in school.
They call that a paradox.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the
change.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: You ever want to earn a little extra
money, you come by L street. You know where I am on L street.</p>
<p><strong>young colin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: To you, O Lord we commend the soul of
Alphonsus, your Servant; in the sight of this world he is now dead; in
your sight may he live forever. Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness and in your goodness grant him everlasting
peace.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: May the angels lead you into paradise; May
the martyrs come to welcome you and take you to the holy city, The new
and eternal Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: Church wants you in your place. What
sort of man wants to be kept in his place? Do this don’t do that, kneel,
stand, kneel, stand…I mean if you go for that sort of thing…</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: I don’t know what to do for you. A
man makes his own way. No one gives it to you. You have to take it. Non
serviam.</p>
<p><strong>young colin</strong>: James Joyce.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: Him and Lucifer. And me. Guineas
from the North End and down Providence, tried to tell me what to do…And
something maybe happened to them.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Jeez, she fell funny.</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Frank, you gotta see somebody.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: You decide to be something, you can
be it. That’s what they don’t tell you, the Church.</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: When I was your age, they would say,
we become cops or criminals. Today, what I’m saying to you is this: When
you are facing a loaded gun…</p>
<p><strong>young costello</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>ecu</strong>: COLIN’S EYES swerve up. We are now on COLIN’S
EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the “age leap”…on the
unchanging eyes.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: The slug enters the skull by forming a
small entrance hole. Blood and brain matter is ejected backwards from
this hole. The bullet, which may expand, fragment or tumble, then passes
through the brain…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fucking firemen are getting pussy for the
first time in the history of fire. Or pussy.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: What are you looking at? Forget it. Your
father was a janitor, and his son’s only a cop.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: innocently stretching for</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: Don’t tell me I’m looking at the first
dickhead-American president of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: The Massachusetts State Police has a long
tradition of excellence. Your graduation today solidifies your
acceptance into one of the finest law enforcement agencies in our
nation. As the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am
confident each and every one of you will serve with distinction, honor
and integrity.</p>
<p><strong>the mayor vo</strong>: Congratulations. You are
dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: School’s out. You earned it. Yeah, no more
teachers, no more books.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: Begin.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: She tells me, you never finish anything. You
finish the police course you get taken care of again baby. So after
graduation I get a blowjob again.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s great. Your mom must be a wonderful
woman.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look at it this way, you’re a black guy in
Boston. You don’t need any help from me to be completely fucked.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Ways to get ahead, though, man, ways to get
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: To where.</p>
<p><strong>drill instructor</strong>: This is not the regular police.
This is the state police. Your training will illustrate the difference.
What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Rage issues and lower median IQ.</p>
<p><strong>drill instructor</strong>: You say something?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, I was agreeing with you about our
obvious superiority to other forms of police, sir.</p>
<p><strong>drill instructor</strong>: We’re not superior, we’re the
best.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Douchebag!</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Congratulations on passing the detective
exam, and welcome to the Special Investigation Unit.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Whoop-di fuckin’ do.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: We won’t be working directly together,
you’ll be working for Captain Ellerby, but I like to see everybody.
You’re a worker, you rise fast.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Like a twelve year old’s dick.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Thank you, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>queenan’s secretary</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Thanks, hon.</p>
<p><strong>queenan’s secretary</strong>: You can go in there now.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: You can sit.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Do you know what we do here? My
section?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, yes, sir, I have an idea…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Whoa, let’s say you have no idea and
leave it there. No idea. Zip, none. If you had an idea about what we do
we would not be good at what we do. We would be cunts. Are you calling
us cunts?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style of his
own. I’m afraid we all have to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: You have family connections down in
Southie. Through your father. Tell us about your uncle Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Uncle Jackie was a carpet layer for Jordan
Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: He got popped by Nicastro in ’95. They
found his body out by the airport.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s right. I remember his funeral.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Closed casket?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: You tell anybody at Deerfield - that
is, before you got kicked out for whaling on a gym teacher with a
folding chair - you had an uncle met his demise like that?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: I got a question. How fucked up are
you?</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: What you got? “Staff Sergeant”. In four
years you’re a sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: SIU. What a country.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I don’t mind going it alone. If you could go
it alone you might get somewhere yourself.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: We’re cops. This isn’t “somewhere”.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I know you’re a worker. I might be able to do
something for you. You got any suits at home or you like coming to work
looking like you’re gonna invade Poland.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Let’s look at the rest of the family
tree. Your maggot uncle Tommy Costigan–he’s another goof– got busted
selling guns to federal officers. Among many, many, many other
departures from, ah, “normative behavior”.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s this got to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Why are you pretending to be a cop?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: This unit is new, and you are the newest
members of it. You have been selected for it on the basis of
intelligence and aptitude.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: This is an elite unit. Our job is to
smash–or at least marginally disrupt– –organized crime in this city by
our own efforts and by enhanced cooperation with the FBI, represented
here by Agent Frank Lazio– and we will do it. And by organized crime in
this city…you know who we mean.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: That’s Jackie Costigan…that’s an old
picture. Jackie met his demise.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Last known photograph.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Costello uses three key guys. There’s
Fitzy…off the boat psycho…lives in Brockton with his mother who looks
like she’s straight out of “Going My Way”… There’s Delahunt, muscle, and
here’s French…the number one. But of course the rock star is…</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We’ve done a briefing book. Read up.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: I want to have any and all ideas, so I can
pass them off as my own. Do your jobs and you will rise fast. You’re in
the best position in the department. Let’s go to work.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Your old man was a hump from Southie.
Baggage-handler at the airport. Family’s all criminals except your old
man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And one priest. Since you seem to know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I ain’t sure about him, either.</p>
<p>****: Last I heard he was happily married to a 12 year old boy and
Family’s dug into the Southie projects like ticks. Lifers down there.
Three decker men at best. You grew up, however, up the North shore. La
di da.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: You were kind of a double kid, I bet, right?
One kid with your old man. One kid with your mother. Upper middle class
in the week, and then dropping your ’r’s and hanging in the Southie
projects with daddy the donkey on the weekends. I got that right?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: You have different accents? You did,
didn’t you. You were different fuckin’ people.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You a psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: If I was I’d ask you why you’re a
Statie making thirty grand a year. And I think if I were Sigmund fucking
Freud himself I wouldn’t get an answer. So tell me, what’s a lace
curtain motherfucker like you doing in the Staties?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well. Families are always rising or falling
in America. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: looking up from his</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hawthorne.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: What’s the matter, smartass? You don’t know
any fuckin’ Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: We have a question. You want to be a cop,
or do you want to appear to be a cop. It’s an honest question. Lot of
guys want to appear to be cops. Gun. Badge. Pretend they’re on TV…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: A lot of em just want to slam a
nigger’s head through a plate glass window.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m all set without your personal job
application, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: What the fuck did you say to me,
trainee?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sir, with all due respect, sir, what is it
you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Hey asshole, he can’t help you. I know what
you are, and what you aren’t. I’m the best friend you ever had on the
face of the earth. I’m gonna help you understand something: You’re no
fuckin’ cop.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: He’s right. We deal in deceptions here. But
what we don’t deal with is self- deception. In five years, you might be
anything else in the world, but you won’t be a Massachusetts State
trooper.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You sure of that?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I’m sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: You don’t have much family.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t have any family.</p>
<p><strong>wasp uncle</strong>: What’s this I hear from Stephanie about
you becoming a policeman?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You mean Stephanie who was the only one who
came to my father’s funeral? That Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: That Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Are you trying to prove something to the
family?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When you say “family”, what do you mean?
You?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: You always question everything, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, well, maybe it would have done you some
good to have a question from time to time. “Am I an asshole?” “Are my
kids a mess?” “Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?” Those are questions.
“Have I been good to my dying sister or am I just pretending to be?” Too
late now, right?</p>
<p><strong>uncle</strong>: Do you need some money for the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When my mother dies we don’t have any
connection. You got it?</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: This is it. Nice. You’ve got high ceilings,
parquet floors. There’s a lock on the fridge in case you have eating
issues…. Joke…not a very good one. So, you’re a policeman?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m a State Police detective.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: State Police Detective. You a married State
Police Detective?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: …No.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Oh, cuz it’s big and I wondered if a
cop…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have a cosigner.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: You intend to have a housemate. That’s
cool.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Give me the fuckin’ papers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: During the war, Churchill used river mines.
He’d float them down the rivers into Germany. They’d either hit
something, or not. That’s what we’ll use you for. I’ll float you down
the river. The rest will happen. Or it won’t…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: By the way, this isn’t police work for
peanuts. There’s money behind this operation. You won’t be paid as a
cop, but there is a bonus involved. Tax free.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Luck of the Irish. All that and you’re still
young enough to fuck undergraduates.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: We can’t conceal that you’ve been a
trainee. You’ll be convicted of a crime. We’re thinking that a guilty
plea to assault and battery might make sense.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Given your nature.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: You’ll serve enough jail time to convince
anyone that it’s no set- up. You’ll be on probation. The whole nine
yards.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I need you, pal. You’ve already pretended to
be a Costigan from South Boston.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Every weekend…Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Do it again. For me.</p>
<p><strong>other prisoner</strong>: You’re Bill Costigan?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who wants to know?</p>
<p><strong>other prisoner</strong>: Nothin.’ I know a Sean Costigan. L
Street.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My cousin.</p>
<p><strong>other prisoner</strong>: Connected but not too bright– No
offense.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison with
the undercover section. Their undercover work is extensive. He’s here to
give us his report. Sgt. Dignam.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: OK. They’re out there, my people.
They’re like the fuckin’ Indians. You’re not gonna see them. You’re not
gonna hear about them except through me or Captain Queenan. You will
not, ever, know the identity of undercover people. This shit hole,
unfortunately, has more fuckin’ leaks than the Iraqi navy.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: I’m tired from fucking your wife.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Good. She’s tired from fucking my
father. OK, today, girls, what I got for you is microprocessors.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Somebody, as you may already know,
stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route
128. They’re the kind of processors they put into computers that can put
a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the
planet. That’s what they do out there on “America’s Technology Highway”.
Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months
walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket
booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a
dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie
projects.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What was his name? The, ah, departed.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a
forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be
in…</p>
<p><strong>lazio</strong>: South Boston?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Who forged your transcript,
dickhead?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I know that guy. His father runs the
Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick’s.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We are not here to solve the “Case of the
Dead Scumbag”. We are here to nail Costello.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: We got a guy says that he hears
Costello is moving the processors to China…that he set up the whole
fuckin’ job and popped Kennefick. You don’t want to miss it if Costello
takes a dump.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We’d miss less if your informants were
available to us, and of course to the FBI …</p>
<p><strong>lazio</strong>: Without asking for details, do you have
anyone in with Costello presently?</p>
<p><strong>sgt. dignam</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.
My theory on Feds is they’re like mushrooms. Feed ’em shit and keep in
the dark. You girls have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s aunt</strong>: Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Aunt Cathy?</p>
<p><strong>billy’s aunt</strong>: Good to see you. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s aunt</strong>: They said you were in the Staties, I
couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I got kicked out about four months ago.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: It was in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well. So you know.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: And why are we graced with your presence?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I brought your mother some pictures of my
father.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: My mother had them. My mother’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry for your troubles.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick,
knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a
matter of fact. You workin’?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: When did I see you after that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Not for a long time. Down the cape after
Rose’s wedding. I think.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had
that fuckin’ buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the
doors at the hotel. I was trippin’…All of them. That was a night.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my
mother died. Insurance.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: In your line of work, if I gave you ten
thousand dollars what could you give me back?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: My line of work… I’m not in that line of work
just presently because I don’t have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of
fact I have never had ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You know what we usually say at these
moments.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You fuckin’ moron. What are you talking
about? I’m not a cop. I’m your cousin.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Fuckin’ Ricans think they know everything. If
they knew shit they wouldn’t be Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Double the money, double the fun. Cinnamon
toasty apple bun… R is for Ricans…P is for pigs…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I can’t stop drinkin.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why would you even think of stopping
drinking?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: He don’t like it. He don’t like drinkin…he
don’t like fightin… …he says stay out of the bars… You know, we’re not
even supposed to do this on this side of fuckin’ Worcester.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who says?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: He says. Costello says. God says, as far as
you’re concerned.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Not a cop. He got out of the joint three weeks
ago. Dead up. He talks like his shit don’t stink but he’s good
people.</p>
<p><strong>villain</strong>: Cunt cop.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I knew his father. I liked his uncle
Jackie better.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Uncle Jackie was excellent.</p>
<p><strong>an irish villain</strong>: Fucking guineas.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A cranberry juice.</p>
<p><strong>well-dressed scumbag at bar</strong>: It’s a natural
diuretic. My girlfriend drinks it when she got her period. You got your
period?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get your hands off me.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Do you know me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I’m the guy who tells you there are
guys you hit and there are guys you don’t. That’s not quite a guy you
can’t hit, but it’s almost a guy you can’t hit, so I’m fucking ruling on
it right now that you don’t hit him, understand?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. Excellent. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I know you. I know your family. Also
I know you do another drug deal with your idiot fucking cop- magnet
cousin I’ll forget your grandmother was very nice to me and cut your
fucking nuts off. You understand that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Now you know me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Cranberry juice.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: What is it, your period?</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Get him a cranberry juice.</p>
<p>****: That’s Jackie’s nephew.</p>
<p><strong>well-dressed scumbag</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Oh, what?</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in school
together. Myles was behind me in school but I knew him. I will get those
responsible. Don’t you want to see us catch whoever used him to do a
robbery and then killed him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs kennefick</strong>: Allegedly.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: “Allegedly”.</p>
<p><strong>mrs kennefick</strong>: If he was killed he probably did
something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You don’t mean robbery do you, Mrs Kennefick?
That’s not what you think he did wrong.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Wave to your girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>mrs kennefick</strong>: I mean fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You get that?</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: “Allegedly” or “fuck yourself?”</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Welcome to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Cut ’em here.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Bye, bye.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Making a house call?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Have I seen you professionally?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No, no. I know what you do. I know who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: When guys have to “use their”service
revolvers” in the “course of duty” they get to talk to you about their
“feelings” and whatnot.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No. Oh, I know how it goes. You’re a mental
health professional.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I have an appointment on this floor.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s good. They’re all fuckin’ crazy on
that floor. I’m one floor up.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Oh, fancy policeman.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s right. Fancy.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Are you a Statie?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yeah, I’m also getting my law degree.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Suffolk, nights?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: They don’t run Harvard Law at night, last
time I checked.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: When was the last time you checked?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Before I went to fucking Suffolk.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I went to U Mass. I wasn’t insulting
you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Well I thought you were, and for that you
have to take me to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Maybe you could shoot someone and I’d have
to see you professionally.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Whatever it takes. I’ll stab someone in the
heart with an icepick right now if it gets me dinner with you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I don’t need a card, I’m a detective.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m only joking. Nice to meet you…
“Madolyn”.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I didn’t know about your tail until I saw it
myself. I couldn’t call, I had the other guy with me. Blue sedan and a
white delivery van, fucked up with graffiti on the side. The van is
audio surveillance. OK, have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You guys from Providence?</p>
<p><strong>proprietor</strong>: What have you done to my place! Get out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You also do probation work, right?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s right. I see “violent
offenders”.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s one way to look at it. Not
necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That have this and they don’t have duck
l’orange.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Was your dinner OK?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Oh, the lobster was excellent. I just
thought, French restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m waiting for you to make your move.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I don’t know what you’re gonna do, but if it
moves I’m going to arrest it .</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What’s it like having people “find
themselves?” All day long people “finding themselves.” Does it get messy
with all those feelings flying around the room?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Why, does that make you uncomfortable?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You know what Freud said about the
Irish?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: If you actually do I’ll see you again.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Who says I want to see you again?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes, course I do. What Freud said about the
Irish is We’re the only people impervious to psychoanalysis.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Tough luck for you with a client list of Mick
cops, isn’t it. “Opening up”? Good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Why do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Some people do get better.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Sometimes, though, I want people to forget
about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Including the criminals?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: If they don’t do their jobs you don’t have
one.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Me? I’d just arrest innocent people. I’ll
arrest you right now.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You’re trouble.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You don’t know the half of it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You met my friend, Mister French the other
night.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is his real name Mister French?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: No. Come with me. I’m not the cops. I’m
not askin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence, and this can cause problems for me.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Those guys you tuned up are connected down
Providence. What they’re going to do is come back up with some guys and
kill you. Which, sure as you’re born, they will do unless I stop them.
Do you want me to stop them?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is it something I can’t do personally?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I’m going to have my associate search
you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Search me? Search me for what?</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: C’m here.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Contra-fucking-band. Take your fuckin’
shoes off.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Shoes off.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I knew your father.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I’m sorry. How did he go?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He didn’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: That was his problem.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who said he had a fuckin’ problem.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I just said he had a fuckin’ problem.
There’s a man could have been anything.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you saying he was nothing?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I’m saying he worked at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: He’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: The arm.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: It makes me curious to see you in this
neighborhood. Regressing. And, if I can slander my own formative
environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. Plus, I don’t know if
it’s beyond some cop prick like fucking Queenan to pull you out of the
Staties, and send you after me. I just can’t know. I don’t know what
they do in…that department, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Are you still a cop?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You swear on your mother’s grave that
you’re not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I am not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You stop doing coke deals with your
jerk-off cousin?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Take it easy. Get your hand taken care of.
I’m sorry. It was necessary. As for our problem with Providence…let’s
not cry over spilled guineas.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What’s this IRA motherfucker doing in my
bar?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Only kidding. How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ah, she’s on her way out.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: We all are. Act accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Do you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: These days, who’s reliable?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: His Uncle Jackie was.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: The Costigans are talented in
general.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You don’t trust a guy behaves like he’s
got nothin’ to lose.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I’m reliable.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Well, you’re one in a million.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Ten million.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What about your wife?</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I thought she was.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: She wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: She got reliable.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Don’t you people ever shut the fuck up?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: “Another county heard from.”</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: One too many.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: The principles of detection tell me that
these men came from Providence.</p>
<p><strong>lynn detective</strong>: I’d appreciate it if you got out of
my crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: This is my crime scene, but knock yourself
out.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I saw a dead guy. I think I have post
traumatic stress. You available for lunch? See you then.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Who’s the lead detective?…Good, he’s a
moron.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I want you to get the cops to look at
Jimmy Pappas for the hit. Of course he had nothing to do with it and
will say so. You look in</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: his car…and find…the gun that did it.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: In the trunk or the glove box?… All
right.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Wanna see some dead guys?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Have a seat, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You know John Lennon?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, he was president before Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Lennon said `I’m an artist. You give me a
fuckin’ tuba and I’ll get you something out of it’.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’d like to squeeze some fuckin’ money out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Smart mouth. Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: The point with John Lennon is a man can
look at anything and make something out of it. For instance, I look at
you and I think what can I use you for?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Get rid of this. Maybe we can work
something out. Let me get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: That was quick. He dead already?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: This will get Captain Ellerby on the six
o’clock news.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: No wonder you get ahead.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I won’t do it if I have to wear a wire. No
wires. Ever, ever, you understand me? You don’t know what this is like.
Micro what?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Microprocessors. We’ll probably be at war
with the Chinese in twenty- odd years and Costello is selling them
military technology. Microprocessors, chips, computer parts. Anybody
says anything about anything like that, you let us know.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Did you have a tip from an informant?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: No, it was tireless police activity that ah
effected ah the arrest of the ah alleged perpetrator.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’ve been put in charge of this unit. It is a
small surveillance sub-unit but it is mine. And I didn’t take this job
in order to fuck it up, or to let anyone else fuck it up, whosoever they
may be. I hand picked this group. You are my A-team so I want you to
conduct yourselves accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hi, Captain. And our primary target is
obviously Frank Costello. But we don’t communicate with anyone else in
this shop. Queenan is compartmentalizing everything in SIU. It’s the
right thing to do, personally I don’t trust these fucking troopers
either. We think we might have a problem. We think Costello’s got a rat
in the State Police.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yeah. Really.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Do we have direct access to Queenan’s
undercovers?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No. Ah…not presently. Not presently. But I’m
hoping to get things…reorganized. That’s it. Congratulations. Don’t
disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: I know why I’m here. I made him feel
guilty. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Intelligence and aptitude.</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: That’s new.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hello Dad. I have a new job.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Where’s your fucking license? I don’t
see no fucking license.</p>
<p><strong>bookie</strong>: What license.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: There’s no such thing as a license,
of course, but you definitely have to have one. If you are not being run
by us you will be run by someone else, which means you will have let
undesirable elements into Mr. Costello’s area.</p>
<p><strong>hard guy</strong>: I was going for my fucking cigarettes…</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Hey, that’s Jimmy Bags. What the fuck
you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What the fuck. I didn’t know….</p>
<p><strong>bookie</strong>: There’s no profit if I pay him two grand a
week. I’m in the hole if I pay him two grand a week.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Then make more money or go out of
business. This is America. If you don’t make money you’re a fucking
douchebag. What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>bookie</strong>: Make more money.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: That’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, well. Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Guy didn’t need
need his teeth anyway. Maybe if he was an Eskimo. But in this country we
eat a variety of items.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: He knocked Jimmy Bags teeth out.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He was…</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Reaching for his cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay! You gonna give me shit, it wasn’t no
reason—-he put his hand in his coat! I don’t know if he’s a bookie or
what the fuck he’s doing…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Well, you know what the fuck a bookie
does?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Pays you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who goes
around knocking guys teeth out for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Here. From now on call the bar and ask for
Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask for Mikey because there’s no Mikey. Wait.
We’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Forty-eight hours from the time this
phone first rings, you take the fucking chip out - like so - and you
fucking destroy it. After three days a phone ain’t clean. If you use a
phone which is not clean, you will have a accident. You never call us.
We call you. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I can’t fuckin’ hear you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t look. There’s a white van across the
parking lot?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: They don’t have directional
microphones.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What, do you got x-ray vision?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: They don’t have directional
microphones.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: People looking at you make you self-
conscious?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Why? They’re minuses. They can’t tell the
difference between a rock star and a career criminal.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Anyone not a criminal is a minus?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What are you soft? That’s not what I said.
Eat something, Jesus Christ, we got a nice day by the water. Sun’s
shining, gulls are up…Nice smell of ozone…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You know if your father were alive and saw
you, sitting here with me, let’s say he would have a word with me about
this, in fact, he’d kill seven guys just to cut my throat. And he could
do it, which is something you may not know about William Costigan,
Sr.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He never, ah, I mean never?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: He kept his own counsel. He never wanted
money. You can’t do a thing with a man like that. Your uncle Jackie
needed a lot of money. But even though he got his money from me, he also
would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. And I
think about this.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So what are talking about here?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Fact is you’re not a guy fresh from the
zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and I don’t see you up
the dog track as a general manager.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look at it this way. It’s like a tuba. I want
to see if I can get something out of it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You ever think of going back to
school?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: With all due respect, Mr. Costello, school’s
out.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Well that’s your problem. Maybe someday
you’ll wake the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Good day, Fathers.</p>
<p><strong>priests</strong>: Good morning , Francis, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You recall our chat? “I am as God made
me”, was that what you said? May I remind you, God don’t run the bingo
in this archdiocese.</p>
<p><strong>young priest</strong>: May I remind you, Mr. Costello, that
pride comes before the fall.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What comes before the Fall is the
Summertime.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: How is Sister Mary Theresa doing? We had a
tasty relationship before she took her vows. Enjoy your clams,
cocksuckers.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m not making enough progress with
Costello?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: “Progress” is hard to define. I make
progress every day. In fact, I’m making progress now. There are guys in
this department make excellent progress for twenty years without ever
getting anything you could definitively call a result. It’s like any
American industry. Nobody minds if you don’t succeed as long as you
don’t fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Objectives get lost sight of: fair enough.
Who did the two guys from Providence?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Jimmy Pappas.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: And what happened to Jimmy Pappas?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: He had a heart attack in jail and got knifed
in his bed at Boston City Hospital. I believe it’s been in the
papers.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Are you happy with this result?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It’s a result.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Cui gives a shit. It’s got a bow on it.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: I think you are a cop, my son.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, please…</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Brian, stop it, I ain’t gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Wake the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Hey. Let’s go through the routine.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: You think you can pop someone. There’s no
special card to play. The guy whose jaw you broke was Boston Police
Department.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m going fuckin’ nuts. I can’t be someone
else every day.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Most of the people in the world do it every
day. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m not them.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: You’re nobody. You signed the paper. We’re
the only people in the world who know that you’re a cop. Maybe we’ll
just erase your file.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: And zip, you’re a soldier for Costello, open
to arrest for how many felonies? Maybe we’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Maybe I’ll fucking kill you.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Easy now. That was a joke, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Just because you play a fucking tough guy
doesn’t mean you are one, you lace curtain fucking pussy.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Be smart. If someone was watching how are
we supposed to not arrest you?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Keep your act together. It’s just a little
while longer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When are you going to take Costello? What’s
wrong with taking ’em on any one of the million felonies you’ve seen him
do. Get him for pissing in the street.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What, are you waiting for him to chop me up
and feed me to the poor?</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Well. That would stick…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: You shut up. We’re building a case. It
takes time. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There’s something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Maybe. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Keep your ears opened. No bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I want you to listen for any chatter about
a spy in the Special Investigation Unit. You hear anything like
that?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Hang tight for me. Just a little longer.
We’re this close.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Thank you, Billy</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Uniform clipped him on the Pike for a
suspended licence. However, as he’s the subject of an open
investigation—-</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: At least one. He’s one of Costello’s
crew.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: —-we’re entitled to get a warrant. We can’t
get an address off him. He paged his lawyer but the lawyer hasn’t called
back yet.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Who’s the lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: He didn’t know the name. He just had the
number on a card. Beeper number.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Did he beep him?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Twice.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Give me your phone. Turn the camera off. Turn
it off.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Give my your phone and turn the fucking
camera off. Who’s is this? I’m gonna take this.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: He can’t do that, can he?</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: He just did.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Mr. Fitzgibbon, afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: You my attorney?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What do you think? Did you make any
statements or phone calls I need to be aware of?</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: I beeped you. The card they gave me…that’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s it? Don’t you have to call your mother
and tell her you’re not gonna be home for supper?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: The cameras are off. Call your mother.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Lookit. They’re in there suiting up for a
raid. I don’t know where they are going, but they do. And so do you.
Call your mum.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Mum, I’m not gonna make it for supper. I got
held up. Yeah, talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Everybody out. Move.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Who are you? When do I get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I think you need another attorney, after all,
Mr. Fitzgibbon. Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Run the last number called. That’ll be his
house. Whatever the location is I’ll swear I surveilled him at it.
Abracafuckindabra.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Why’d you use my phone?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Because you didn’t go in there.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: The light’s nice here in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: It’s all right. Guys tend to make a big
deal out of it. It’s actually quite common.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I gotta go to work.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s like confession. Isn’t it. This sort of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: People make things up in confession. You know
that?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I know they do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: People are liars. They want to be stars of
their little films.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s an interesting observation.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do you lie?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Why do you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m asking if you lie.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Honesty isn’t synonymous with truth.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You lie. So, is it to do some good, to get
somewhere personally, or just for the fuck of it?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I expect sometimes…people…do it to keep
things…on an even keel.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So, you had a parent who was a drunk?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Let’s keep this with you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There was a cop leaving when I came in.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: How do you know he was a cop?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight air
of scumbag entitlement. You see cops?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s part of what I do. Although, I don’t
normally see cadets who were kicked out of the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You should get a better job…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do they all come in and cry…your cops?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Sometimes they cry if they had trouble at
home or if they’ve had to…use their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let me tell you something. They signed up to
use their fuckin’ weapons. Most of them. But they watch enough TV so
they know they have to “weep” after they use their weapons. No one’s
more full of shit than a cop. Except a cop on TV.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I looked through your file and I see you
have a record of assault. What was it like for you in jail?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You want to hear about the showers?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Did something happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. You sit there with a mass murderer, your
heart-rate jacked, your hand…steady. That’s one thing I found out about
myself in prison. My hand doesn’t shake, ever.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: What do you expect from coming here?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I have to come here.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I know it’s not elective…on your part…but,
now that you’re here, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You want the truth? Valium.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: If you lied, you’d have an easier time
getting what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s that say about what you do for a
living?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Look, I think we better have a few more
meetings before we can even talk about prescriptions.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m having panic attacks. You didn’t even ask
about that. Last night I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. I
puked in a trash barrel on the way in here, I haven’t slept for
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes. I said something true. I want some
fucking pills and you close my file? I thought I was supposed to tell
the truth here.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: If only fuckin’ here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Guy comes in in pain, against every instinct
of …privacy, of, of, self reliance… that he has, and you don’t help him?
You send him off to score smack on the fucking street?!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Two pills.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why don’t you just give me a bottle of scotch
and a handgun to blow my fucking head off. Are we done here with this
psychiatry bullshit?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You can leave!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What if that was a legitimate threat? .</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Fuck…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Why is the hardest patient of the day
always the last one?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Because you’re bored and tired and don’t give
a shit. It’s not supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Look, I’m not just…somebody you have to see
or they put you in jail. If you are in distress I will help you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: My card. And a prescription for twenty
Lorazepam.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is it enough to kill myself?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Maybe it is. All right? Have I done my job
up to your goddamned standards? Because by my standards you fit the
model of drug-seeking behavior, and fuck you if you don’t like my
initial clinical reaction.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m transferring you to another
counselor.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You wanna get a cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: All right, let’s bring it in, please. Come
in please. Our target is a major transaction of microprocessors. Yes,
those. I don’t know what they are. You don’t know what they are. Who
gives a fuck? Cash will be handed over in a building which we have under
AV surveillance. Staff Sergeant Sullivan’s team… Will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Did you guys know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: How long have we been tapped on this
building?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Our unit will not take action until a man
Captain Queenan has inside the operation has verified the transaction.
Questions? Anyone? This is who we’re after.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We’ve been after this cocksucker for a long
time, and tonight we’re gonna get him. Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We’ve been after this son of a bitch for a
long time, and we’re getting him tonight. Get to work.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Go find out what we’re doing and get on
it.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Sorry to get you at the last minute. But
things leak. This lead came from Queenan’s undercover guy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m not going to make dinner. Something big
has come up.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Too bad. Your mother worked all goddamned
day. We’ll just have to sit down without you and your friends.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Oh, my friends are still coming.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: We’ll just say lunch tomorrow. All right,
bye.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: The readiness is all. You know the players,
call the game.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Thank you, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>geek cop</strong>: Piece of cake. I’ll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: All cellphone signals are under
surveillance through the courtesy of our Federal friends over there…</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Patriot Act. Love it. Love it.</p>
<p><strong>detail of im</strong>: “No Phones”</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: All right. That’s Costello right there.
Costello, Mister French, Fitzy, Delahunt, Billy Costigan the new
guy…Time is 10.46.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Who are they meeting?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: I don’t know. Some Chinamen from points
unknown. They’re already inside.</p>
<p><strong>camera geek cop</strong>: We have a blind spot.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Why do you have a blind spot?</p>
<p><strong>camera geek cop</strong>: We had two hour’s notice. Two
hours. What the fuck you think this is, NASA?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: It never crossed my mind. You get a camera
in the back?</p>
<p><strong>tech cop in down vest</strong>: What back?</p>
<p><strong>text message</strong>: “Blind spot inside door.”</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Turn off your cell phones.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Check your weapons…Fitzy has the
chicken…</p>
<p><strong>camera cop</strong>: Maybe if we had some Homeland security
money like some other fucking douchebags I could mention…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Any calls?</p>
<p><strong>phone tech cop</strong>: They turned off their phones.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Search randomly for calls made from the
area.</p>
<p><strong>phone tech cop</strong>: Eight hundred seven phones are live
in this area.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Narrow the area.</p>
<p><strong>lazio</strong>: What you see for coverage is what you
get.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Why the fuck did they turn off their
phones?</p>
<p><strong>phone tech cop</strong>: Wait, there’s still one phone
up.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>detail</strong>: “buyers here”.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: The buyers are there.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: You know, direct access to your fucking
guys would have certain fuckin’ advantages.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Not to my guy.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: This is unbelievable. Fuck it, who put the
cameras in the fucking place?</p>
<p><strong>camera tech cop</strong>: Who the fuck are you.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I’m the guy who does his job. You must be
the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Hey, hey, hey…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: How you going, Robert?</p>
<p><strong>chinese translator</strong>: Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to
tell you that at least two of these gents have machine guns.</p>
<p><strong>chinese gangster</strong>: Waiting, waiting. We almost
departed! This man is from the Embassy. He will have to blow his brains
out if he is captured. His entire family will be killed.</p>
<p><strong>chinese translator</strong>: He’s a little upset.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Tell him light on the starch.</p>
<p><strong>chinese translator</strong>: He’s fronting the Chinese
government and he’s just scared shitless.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Government man. I’m concerned about
Chinamen who think it’s wise to bring automatic weapons to a business
transaction.</p>
<p><strong>chinese gangster</strong>: Ngup, Ngup, Ngup. Ngaw um ming.
Kay ngup mutt.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the
Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons because here, in
this country, it don’t add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence
for it.</p>
<p><strong>chinese gangster</strong>: Put away that machine gun.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan any
time in this century, you tell them they better shape up fast and show
me one million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What we generally do in this country is
one guy shows up with the items, and the other guy pays him. No
tickee…no laundry.</p>
<p><strong>chinese gangster</strong>: Nay tiey ching chaw yut bok mon. .
ALTERNATE/ALSO : Ne dei yeeche ling ngnaw dong maw gok nay chun.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: In English, thank you, also.</p>
<p><strong>chinese gangster</strong>: Du ne.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: The expedition continues this way.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Don’t tell me those cars were empty. Please
don’t tell me those Chinamen’s cars were empty. Do you have a camera in
the back.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: See, no surveillance here. They didn’t
figure we had a navy. Always figure an exit for your business partners.
What with everything all dug up, you can’t trust a slant to find the
Mass Pike and, with or without Staties out front, frankly I don’t
approve of orientals driving to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What about us, Frank? What’re we gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: We depart. We didn’t commit no
illegalities.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Except sell the ching chongs a bunch
of fuckin’ plastic.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Good Morning.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I beat the movers.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: How was the last night in the, ah, old
establishment?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Lonely.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m glad to hear that. It sucked here,
too.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m gonna thank your Uncle Alphonsus for
the square footage.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: French donut?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yeah. Hey, can I…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Sure yeah.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Well, we’re not having this out.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You don’t see any pictures of where I came
from. Look, I respect who you are, but not in the living room. We might
have company.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Company?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Why work for the state?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Why not? You do.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Not forever, and you don’t have to. You’ve
got degrees…you’re a hot shit… I mean, what you do, why make as much as
a guidance counselor?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I believe in public service.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Now you’re just being ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You like me living here?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Answer it. You live here.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Mayor Sullivan’s Office.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I think it’s a guy with a, ah, A cancer
guy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Something for work.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What the fuck is it with your phone?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Nothin’, nothin’. It doesn’t have any power,
that’s all. It just happened once.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Was that that shrink cunt answered the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes. Yes. As I said, she was gonna move in,
so she moved in.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You better get organized, quick.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Last time I checked, I tipped you off and
you’re not in jail.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Are listening to me, son? Do you like
Little Miss Thing sucking your cock?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes. Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: So earn it. I’m gettin’ the feeling we got
a cop in my crew.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I been gettin’ that same feeling.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: He’s one of yours. Inside. Have you seen
anything?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Look, I have no access to undercover files in
Queenan’s department. It’s locked up. Queenan and Dignam run the
snitches. They don’t give anybody a peep. I’m doing the best…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Your best? What do you think we’re in, the
fuckin’ haberdashery business?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Please Frank, if you don’t relax I can’t
relax. Let’s start with this…get me all the information on the people
around you last night. Everyone that works for you. Get me real first
names. Get me…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Get you? Give you? Who the fuck do you
work for?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Okay, Frank…I’m sorry…could you please get me
social security numbers, ah, I need drivers license numbers, full names,
dates of birth, anything like that. Bank account numbers, everything
that you don’t get from a criminal record or, or a wrap sheet or a…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Collie, calm down or you’ll shoot in your
pants. I’ll get you the records and whatnot. You’ll have ’em but listen
to me son, don’t disappoint me on this, or some other guy will be
putting their cock up Little Miss Freud’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: How are you, Francis?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: My mother called me Francis.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I know she did. And your father called you
the tumor.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Oh, what did your father call you,
Charlie? Oh yeah, I forgot, he wasn’t around.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Where are the real microprocessors,
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Microprocessors…oh yeah, I heard that
story. You arrested some Chinese government guy at the border carrying
some light sockets or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I can’t wait to wipe that fuckin’ smirk off
your face.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Wouldn’t you rather wipe my ass for
me?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I will get you, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: If you could’ve you would’ve but I guess
you like to go at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Excuse me, I’ve got a date with some
angels.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Sooner than you think, Francis.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You have a boss that has a
laryngectomy?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No, no, no. That was a guy who works for
me.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: You’re lying to me.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Not exactly. There are certain things I will
not be able to talk to you about. I cannot allow you to jeopardize an
ongoing investigation. There really are things connected to my job that
you can’t ask about. That you don’t want to know about.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Okay, then say that.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I will. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s the movers.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You still wanna stay?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: All right. All right. I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m gonna get on a plane unless you put
Queenan on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Queenan had a funeral to go to. This is my
shift. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why shouldn’t I get on a fucking plane? Meet
up? Do you actually want me dead? There’s a rat in your unit. That’s a
fact. You just don’t know it. Where’s Queenan?</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They knew you had cameras in the building.
You have a leak from the inside. It’s real. Smoke him out.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: And how do we do that Mr… fucking genius who
didn’t even graduate the academy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you’re
getting a sealed wiretap warrant for Costello’s apartment. Don’t tell
anyone in our department but tell SIU. Flush it and see if it comes out
of the pipe on my end. That’s first. Narrow it down. Where’s
Queenan.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Are you deaf? He’s not here. Call me when
you get something real.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m assuming you want to change things, you
know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change
everything, anything. Too many choices can see like no choice at
all…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Confucius say that?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: So you do…something radical.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: “Something radical,” huh?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: …yeah, you do… Sometimes it’s just a matter
of picking a thing and doing it…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So how long you been with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Oh, four months. About four months.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You love this guy?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: It’s pretty serious, yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A head case or anything? I’m just
curious…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: No more than I am.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Then you’re lucky. Considering the odds,
right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good, give him a shot.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Doctors aren’t supposed to have
illusions.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, that’s because of vastly superior
intelligence. Godlike, really.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: OK, I’m in a serious, newly serious,
relationship…there are…ups and downs…everybody has doubts, problems – I
mean doubts.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What would you do if he was standing right
there and saw us?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’d lie. To keep things on an even keel.
You know all about it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You take off an armored car at the Dedham
Mall and what do you do. Do you pay guineas in Providence?</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: Fucking now I do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What the fuck do you do.</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: What, I pay Costello and wait for him to
trade me to the FBI? Cause that’s what he does.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: FBI? What the fuck are you talking about.</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: Oh my God, is that French out there?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What the fuck did you just say about the
FBI?</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: Forget what I said. I’m fucking high,
I’m high.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Whatever’s going through your very poor, very
limited, brain…I’m not going to hurt you. Just tell me what you just
fucking said.</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: Forget it, I’m high, I must be high, I
would never say what you thought I said.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Tell me what the fuck you said.</p>
<p><strong>bankrobber</strong>: Why do you think he’s not arrested?
Costello’s a protected FBI informant. He’ll trade you out. I thought I
was supposed to go into shock. I’m not in shock. It fucking hurts. It
fucking hurts.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>on sound</strong>: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: What do you want? What are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Costello is giving people up to the</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: The FBI?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He gives information to the FBI. He’s a
protected informant. Aren’t they trying to make it a Federal case? And
it never gets made?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Go around the back. Go around the back.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: My wife’s asleep. She left supper out. Come
and have something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, I…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: We’ll talk in the kitchen. Come and have
something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Congratulations. Haven’t seen a guy like
you since me. You’ll be transferred to Internal Investigations but you
will continue to work right where you are in the Special Investigation
Unit.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We are all convinced that Costello has at
least one mole in the Special Investigation Unit.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: You’ll investigate. Everybody. Anybody.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Well, that’s just a dream job for a cop.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: We have considered all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record. Some people never trust a guy with an
immaculate record. I do. I have an immaculate record.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Play golf?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: That’s a pity. Pretty much sucks as a game
but you get to form relationships. How’s the wedding coming along?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Everything’s great. On schedule. She’s a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Outstanding. That’s good. Marriage is an
important part of getting ahead. You don’t want anyone thinking you’re a
homo. Married guy seems stable. People look at a wedding ring and think:
someone can stand the son of a bitch. Ladies see the wedding ring and
know immediately that you must have some cash and that your cock
works.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Oh, it’s working. Overtime.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: I’m glad to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Boss wants your real name, your
social, your license number, all your bank account numbers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t have a bank account.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: I’m a cash business myself.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s he doing, setting up IRAs?</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: You fill in the papers, real name,
all your numbers, no fucking around, and then we all wait here.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: No, I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Put the forms in there.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: I don’t know if this is how you spell
Citizens’.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, no, no. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: What are you, retarded? That ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Billy, he said to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m not sitting in this room without a
tetanus shot. I’m not staying.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>onscreen</strong>: Follow the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why can’t Ellerby’s guys? SIU.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: They can’t. They are compromised.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Oh yeah, be dirty.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: See anything you like?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You’re not indulging in self abuse are
you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Frank, we got problems.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I hope you’re not turning into one of
those sob sisters, who wants to get caught. You’re not crackin’ up are
you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I don’t crack up.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Pick a place where any cop could see
you…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Why did you show up then?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I own the place.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Why am I not fuckin’ surprised. Look…</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You’re gettin’ reassigned.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: How the fuck did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Where’d they put you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have to find myself.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You’re telling me, sonny boy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have to find the guy you have in the
department.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself, I put my money on nobody finding
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Frank, for me, you’ve got to lay low.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Laying low is not what I do.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yeah, big fuckin’ daddy Frank. Lookit, Frank,
what good am I to you if you don’t listen to me? Queenan’s
compartmentalizing. He’s fuckin’ smart, you know that. I will find this
rat if you let me do it my way. If you let me do my job.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Okay. But Colin, I hope I won’t have to
remind you, that if you don’t find that cheese eating rat bastard in
your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won’t be me
who pays for it.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Why would you need to remind me of that? I
didn’t know that would I be any good at what I do? Trust me, I know how
to do this.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It involves lying, and I’m pretty fucking
good at that, right?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Maybe it’s because it’s always been so
easy for me to get cunt that I never understood jerking off in a
theatre.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Who knows what’s easy? Collie, take care
of business.</p>
<p><strong>text message detail</strong>: Make arrest.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Your name’s on the pill label. I thought you
weren’t supposed to be in the book, in case of obsessive patients.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: How obsessive are you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Medium.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Are you okay? Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I really liked our conversations. I’ve
been…regretting that we didn’t continue…our conversations.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’m glad you want to see me…it’s nice to
see you…I enjoyed talking…I enjoyed having coffee with you, very
much…but I don’t see people…I don’t see people in my home.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thanks. If this is inappropriate… I can
leave.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: No, it’s, it’s, it’s not
inappropriate…you’re not a patient…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You moving in or out?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I still have three weeks on the lease…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Would you like a cup of tea?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Do you want some…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sugar? No…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I’ve always needed my own place.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hedging your bets?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: No. I’m not “hedging my best”…I told you
when we had coffee…There’s a choice. You choose…you have to make a…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Decision.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: …decision…and stick by what…you choose…you
have to…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Move in with your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Yes. Stick by what you…otherwise it’s… I
have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now.
Is it real?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You don’t have cats.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I like that. That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You got a girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. No. What does that matter?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Depends. I’m sure you know by now there’s
an informer in my crew. Cop. Staties or Boston Police department, I’m
not sure.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What about the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: It ain’t. Trust me. The ex-wife, an old
friend or stupid…that’s what brings you down in this business.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Stupid…Well, that leaves me out.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Past days, case like this…I killed
everybody who works for me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Better safe than sorry, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: On the other hand, back then, it was only
five…or six…and French.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I look around at your guys. They’re all
murderers right? I think “could I do murder?” And all I can answer
myself is, “what’s the difference”.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Give em up to the Almighty. Like that.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, that’s my point. You accuse me once, I
put up with it. You accuse me twice, I quit. If you make me fear for my
life, I put a fucking bullet in your head as if you were anybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You got something you want to say to me,
William?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re seventy fucking years old. One of
these guys is going to pop you. As for running drugs, what the fuck. You
don’t need the pain in the ass, and they’re going to catch you. And you
don’t need the money.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I haven’t needed “the money” since I took
Archie’s milk money in the third grade. Tell the truth, I don’t need
pussy any more,but I still like it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Point I’m making…you see…I got this
rat…gnawing, cheese eating fucking rat…questions come up…questions…see,
Bill, you’re the new guy…and the girlfriend. Why don’t you stay in the
bar when I get the numbers. Your numbers. Everybody’s numbers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Is there something you want to ask me,
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Start with, you agree there is a rat?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You said there is one. I base most of what I
do on the idea that you’re pretty fucking good at what you do.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Sure, sure, all that aside…but you Bill,
what would you do?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How many of these guys been with you long
enough to be disgruntled? Who needs more money than you pay them? You
don’t pay much, you know. It’s almost a feudal fuckin’ enterprise. The
question is, who thinks that they would do what you do better than
you?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Only one that can do what I do is me. You
want to be me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I probably could be you. I know that much.
But I don’t want to be you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Heavy lies the crown…sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Francis.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: We’re out of here, Mister Costello.
You’ll have to set the alarm.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Thank you, Jimmy. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: There’s a boat coming in, up in
Gloucester. French will give you all the details.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You heard nothing?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Nothing about drugs. Nothing about new
guys, nothing about Gloucester?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No, Frank, not a thing. And I promise you I
would have heard about it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You’re sure. No other departments, no
codes, like that…</p>
<p><strong>colin’s voice</strong>: Frank. You can relax on this one.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Okay, Collie. I will.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: It ain’t Bill. No way, he says. Thank God
for Billy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: A problem?</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Yeah, I run rat fucks like you. I don’t like
them.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: The day you wouldn’t take a promotion, you
let me know. And I wouldn’t even have a job if you did yours.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I need to know the identity of your
undercovers.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Blow me. Not literally, there’s no promotion
in it for ya.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Morning, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Look who’s here. The Queen of the prom.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: They are not happy with me. Especially Staff
Sergeant Dignam.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: What do you expect? Everybody knows you’re
assigned here to find Costello’s rat. They want to find the leak as much
as you do. What they do not want is to be accused of being the rat.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fair enough. Well one of them has to be
dirty, We know that, right?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Two days ago, my undercover guy in
Costello’s organization—-</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Lots of luck. You can go over my head, high
as you like. You still won’t get an answer.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: As I said, two days ago, my guy nearly
found out who Costello’s rat is. He lost him in the street.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Really? Did he get a look at him?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: …No.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Nothing that could help us?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Any advice? Generally?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Costello can’t do business without
coordinating with his source… Who is here. In SIU. Follow Costello and
you’ll find his rat.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: You’re going to be looking at my people.
Going through their bank statements, phone bills, medical records. Don’t
expect them to get you a coffee or invite you to their houses. Let me
get you a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Follow Costello and you’ll find his
informer.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Internal Investigations.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: This is Sullivan. I need constant
surveillance on Captain Queenan, starting right now.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: If I wasn’t with the Mass State Police. If I
did it full time,law school, I’d be through in a year. I’m thinking
that. If I wasn’t a trooper.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Nothing. Nothing. There’s nothing going on.
Just thinking.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Okay, all right. And what about money?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I got some money. Another city…I’m thinking
that.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Another city? It’d be a clean slate.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I want you to know you don’t gotta stay. If
we’re not going to make it, it’s got to be you that gets out. I’m not
capable I’m fuckin’ Irish, so I’ll deal with something being wrong for
the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Not a bad idea, another city.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Of course I know how to spot a cop.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Oh yeah, how’s that?</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: If he’s not paying attention to us, he’s a
cop.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: See that guy over there, he’s a cop. He’s
not paying attention to us. He’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Lot of fucking cops.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: What kind of dog is that?</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: She’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: She’s probably the fucking Police
Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: You can get out of here. This is the crew
for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I thought I was on for that.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I changed my mind. Take the night off.
Jimmy, get the mop.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Go out the back. Some guys answer the
questions right. Some don’t.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: You’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: You’re ignoring us. You’re a cop. We’re
guessing who cops are. Most good looking women are cops.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right. I’m going home. He’s playing with his
new boys.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s moving something with all new guys. I
don’t want to tell you what or where. It might be disinformation. It
probably is. Just keep following him. I need to see you today.
No. Today.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Can I ask a question, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>detective 2</strong>: Why the fuck are we following Captain
Queenan? To find out about the good Catholic life?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have to follow every lead, however
unlikely, however fucking painful it might be to your delicate fucking
sensibilities.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Who says I have delicate
sensibilities?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have reason to believe that Queenan is
Costello’s informer. Follow him, and don’t get made.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Copy that, Sarge</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: We got him.</p>
<p><strong>detective 2</strong>: Sarge, we got the target.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Where are you now?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look down the car.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Got me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Any reason you’d have a tail?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: No…Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m watching a guy…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I don’t have a tail, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay. Get off at South Station. You wait
there for ten minutes. After I leave I’ll text message you the address
where we’ll meet. I’ll make sure you don’t have a tail.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: South Station. Wait ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: He went into a building on the
waterfront. Address is 344 Wash…</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: He went to the top floor. It’s empty.
No tenants.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: I don’t know what we’re doing here.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I think I’ve got him. I think Queenan is
meeting with him right now.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Get the van. Get the boys.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I assume these premises do not have an
anti-smoking ordinance. So, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I told you, he’s got dope coming in, I don’t
know where. He’s getting spooky, Captain…</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s crazy. I just saw the man. He had blood
all over him. I can’t get any more information for you. I can’t trust
it. He’s not including his regular guys… I’m telling you, he’s gonna
find out who I am. He’s gonna fuckin’ kill me, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: All right, all right. I hear you. I’m sorry
for you trouble. Look, I’m not gonna jeopardize your safety any longer.
I’ll get you out. I can’t do it overnight but I’ll do it. We can bust
him for what we have. At least I think we can…I hope. You’re out of
there</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah? What about the FBI?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: They’re compromised.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: They’re fucked, just like this lighter.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Billy, where the fuck are you? We been
trying to reach you. We found the rat. Top man says we’re gonna take
care of him. The address is 314 Washington Street. You got it? All
right. See you there.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You were fucking followed.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Costello’s people.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. One of the cops he’s got inside tipped
him.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p><strong>detective 2</strong>: Holy fucking shit. Looks like Queenan’s
meeting with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They’ll be on the elevators, too.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Take the back fire escape.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’ll you do?</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: I’ll be fine. If you get made I can’t
protect you. Go down the fire escape. Now. That’s an order. I’ll be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>queenan</strong>: Can I help you gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: I guess we’ve had enough of this shit.
Where’s your boy?</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Fuck! Something came off the roof.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What came off the roof? What do you mean
something came off the roof? Go again with that information.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: You’re fuckin’ late. Where the fuck were you?
Get in the fuckin’ van.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What the fuck happened? I came to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Stay in the fucking car. Stay in the
fucking car. This is a surveillance unit. Do I pursue.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No. Stay where you are. I need some fucking
information here. What came off the building?</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: No pursuit. No pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>detective 1</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>detective 4</strong>: Thirty-two X to CP. Thirty-two X to CP.
We’re being fired upon. I repeat.</p>
<p><strong>detective 4</strong>: We have an officer down. An officer has
been shot. Request immediate assistance.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: And where the fuck were you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Boss told me to go home.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t. At any rate
you weren’t fuckin’ home.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I was in a fucking grocery store with no
signal. When I got a signal I got the call. What the fuck do you want.
Was I there or was I not there? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Billy. Billy</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Two days…two days ago the Boss says to me,
it’s been ten years already, and you’ve never done me wrong. He asked
me, if one of the other guys is a rat, would I take him out. I told him
I would but I don’t know if I would. Now I know I can’t. I’ve done a lot
of bad things but I’ve never been a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Hey Billy, I don’t want no one to put me
in a dumpster. Just don’t put me in a dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: When you’re dead it makes no difference where
they put you.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: You know what I thought today?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Who didn’t show up today is the rat.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: You never been late in your life. And when
I called you… I made a mistake. I gave you the wrong address. But you
showed up at the right one.</p>
<p><strong>delahunt</strong>: Tell me why I didn’t say anything. Tell me
why.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: That cop was tough. We were excessive with
the cop.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s dead. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Do you know why Queenan went to that
building?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: A better question is why your fuckers were
following him.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I told Internal Investigations to follow
him.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s internal Investigations business.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have to investigate everybody and anybody.
I don’t have to justify anything. Nor does anyone have to like it. I now
have information…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: from a very good source…that Queenan may have
been killed by his own undercover.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: That’s a fucking lie.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam
here have information on this undercover, and other informants, in a
locked file. I need those files unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I don’t have the password. Why don’t you
come down to the garage…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: No one calls me a liar. Especially when I’m
lying.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Everybody shut up. Work with the tech guys
to unlock the files. Dignam. You take a leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Leave of what?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Queenan’s dead. That makes me your
boss.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: I’ll hand in my papers first.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: Hey, world needs plenty of bartenders. Two
weeks with pay.</p>
<p><strong>dignam</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I need those codes.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: No, you want those codes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I tried to call you a few times.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I know. . I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I can’t be a friend to you. I can’t. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s okay, okay, I know.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Now, when I hear Lucia, I can’t stop
thinking about the cocaine curtsy you did on that nigger broad’s face.
What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Your shouldn’t have killed Queenan.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: One of us was going to have to die. With
me it tends to be the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You’re crazy, Frank. You killed the guy who
has all the information. And Dignam’s not in the office, he’s gone. He
resigned.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I don’t give a fuck about Dignam.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: He’s fucking gone. They took his papers in.
He’s not talking. I don’t know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Don’t get your balls in an uproar, Collie.
That Irish piss-ant won’t be a problem. He’s so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he’ll crawl right in it. Let’s give him a whiff.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Sweetheart, you’re giving me a hard-
on.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Are you sure it’s me or all that talk about
whiffin’ and crawlin’ up asses?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Hey, watch your fucking mouth.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: You watch it.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: Let me straighten you out.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You called this number on a dead guy’s phone.
Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: So it is you. Thank God you’re all right. We
were very worried.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You’re talking to Sergeant Sullivan. I’m
taking over Queenan’s unit.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let me talk to Dignam to confirm it.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Staff Sgt. Dignam has… taken a leave of
absence. He’s very upset. We’re all very upset. The best thing would be
for your to come in. We need you to come in.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: State Police have confirmed that the
body of the man found dead in the Fenway marshes yesterday afternoon is
that of Timothy Delahunt, an undercover policeman for the City of
Boston.. This was the scene today…. If you have any information about
this murder, you are urged to call the Boston Police.</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: Fuck. I can’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>mister french</strong>: Don’t believe what?</p>
<p><strong>fitzy</strong>: I’m embarrassed. How the fuck did they find
him so fast? I spent all fuckin’ night out there, dragged the poor
bastard…. I must have been there seven hours. In three feet of mud. What
the fuck is a marsh? And who walks their dog in a fuckin’ marsh? In
three feet of water? I don’t believe it. I still don’t believe he’s a
fuckin’ cop.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: The cops are saying he’s a cop so I won’t
look for the cop. Are you soft? The next time I tell you to dump a body
in the marshes, put it in the fuckin’ marshes, not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday to get a blowjob!</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Don’t go. You’ve got a tail. Two cars. Not
very subtle. They won’t be subtle from now on. That’s what I’ve been
trying to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: There’s no need to go yourself, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Get rid of the fuckin’ tail!</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I will. All right.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Tails. Fuckin’ rats. This rat shit is
wearing me thin.</p>
<p><strong>french</strong>: Francis, they’re all rats. Women are rats…
cunts…Yeah, we’re becoming a nation of rats.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Stop. Stop. Pull these guys off. Tell your
team to stop following Costello. We don’t need to surveil him.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: What the fuck are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I have it from an undercover: Costello knows
he’s being followed. Let our UC take him in.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: What informant?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Queenan’s guy. He called me when he found out
Queenan was dead. I’m running him.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: No. You give him to me.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: No. But I can give you Costello’s
destination.</p>
<p><strong>ellerby</strong>: You know where he’s going?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Yes. And what he’s about to do. Call off the
tail, and get Special Ops. Get them on standby. We meet him where he’s
going. Suit up. We’re gonna take this prick tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: All units fall back.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It’s the heavy equipment warehouse Costello
owns on Sheffield. He must have a container or a truck in there. Go.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: There’s an exit on the other side. Cover it.
We’ll take him when he comes out.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Load it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How do you know you don’t have a tail?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Were you in the fuckin’ car?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What if they took one off and put another one
on, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Load.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Frank told me to check out the back. You guys
go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>fng dennis</strong>: Watch your ass.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You’re an FBI informant.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I’m talking
to the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Do they know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I never gave up anybody who wasn’t goin’
down anyway.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Did you give me up?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Nobody knows nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Frank, Frank, do they know about me?</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: I know you, Colin. You know I’d never give
you up. You’re like…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: A son…to you? Is that what it is about, all
that murderin’ and fuckin’ and no sons? What are you, shooting
blanks?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I got Costello! I got Costello here!</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It’s not any reason for, ah…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>queenan’s secretary</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: He’s waited a long time for you.</p>
<p>****: How’d you get him without the files?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Caller ID. On Queenan’s phone. You know that
guy?</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Yeah, we were classmates together.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m gonna go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Good to see you Trooper.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. “Trooper”.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone. How
long have you been undercover?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Long time. Long fuckin’ time.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I can’t begin to tell you what a debt we owe
you. I want you to know I’ll be recommending you for the Medal of
Merit.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Medal of Merit. Oh, yeah. That’s kinda like a
gold star around here, right?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: It’s the highest honor we got.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I just want my identity back.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You want to be a cop again?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, being a cop’s not an identity. I want my
identity back.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’ll have to excuse me. My only contact has
been with a police shrink.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: A police shrink. Was that… helpful for
you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What are you gonna do about the rat in this
building?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m gonna find him. Don’t you worry about
that. You got anything? Did Frank, ah, say anything…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m all done being a cop. I just want to get
my money and go home.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fair enough. You’ve given a lot. I can get
you your file. I just need your password.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The password’s my name, William Costigan,
Jr. They gave it to me in case something happened to them and I had to
explain myself to someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: All right, Bill. Just give me a minute. I’m
gonna go in the other room. This computer’s gone blooey on me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know. I’m not here to…I’m not here for
that. I’ve got something to…to give to you…something I need you to keep.
For me.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I need you to be my friend here and not ask
any questions. That’s for you to hold.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Only you. Open this if I’m dead or if I call
you and tell you to open it. Please do exactly what it says. Exactly
what it says, please.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m sorry to show up here like this. There
was no one else I could give it to. I’m sorry. There was no one
else.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I…we… I’ve, it’s, been so confused… I just
want to say…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Whatever you have to say, really think about
it, and if you still want to tell me, tell me in two weeks, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I was dreaming…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I was dreaming I was dead.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Death is hard. Life is much easier.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Open it</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: You’re joking…</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: It’s not a joke, it’s a human being.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Your guys shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: One of us was going to have to die. It
tends to be the other guy.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m now in charge of everything here.
Including Queenan’s informers. Theoretically. I can’t unlock the files
until after the brass squeezes Dignam. If the brass squeezes Dignam.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: So Dignam’s the only one with the keys to
the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: He’s fucking resigning. He put his papers in.
He’s not talking.</p>
<p><strong>costello</strong>: Give me his location. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>madolyn</strong>: I thought I was the liar.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I can explain.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Costello recorded everything. He put all the
tapes in a little box and kept them with his lawyer. That was his
insurance. His lawyer came to me. Costello trusted me the most. Imagine
that you rat fuck. Sound quality good enough? I was a little
worried.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I want my identity, you two-faced rat
prick.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Three o’clock. Where Queenan died. You keep
your cell on.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Did we not talk about this? This is my
job.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get your hands up. Hands. Hands.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Put the fuckin’ gun down.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I came here to talk some fucking sense to
you. You get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin’ firearm and act
professional and I can get you your money.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I can get you your…</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Fuck, shit…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You didn’t come here to talk, you fuckin’
maggot, you came here to get arrested.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Arrested? Arrested for what. So you got tapes
of what? Costello was my informant. I was his rat? Fuck you. Prove it. I
say he was my informant.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get up and shut your fuckin’ mouth.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What is this, a citizen’s arrest? Blow me,
prick. Only one of us is a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who you are.
Nobody knows who you are.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Would you shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’m a sergeant in the Mass. State Police. Who
the fuck are you? Nobody. I ERASED YOU.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You erased me?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Go ahead. Shoot a cop, Einstein. See what
happens.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What would happen is the bullet would go
right through your fuckin’ head.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Watch what happens.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What, you think you’re gonna get the parade?
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you. I’m arresting you.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: That’s the stupidest thing you could do.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shut up, shut up, shut the fuck up. I don’t
give a fuck if these charges don’t stick. But I’m still fucking
arresting you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get up. I said get the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Put down the weapon and step away from
Sergeant Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I called you. You specifically. You know who
I am. I’m not gonna shoot. I told you to meet me downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Put the weapon on the deck and step away from
Sergeant Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Shoot the fuckin’ prick.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where’s Dignam? I told you to bring
Dignam!</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Shoot the motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Put the weapon on the ground and we’ll
discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He was Costello’s rat. I got evidence. Tapes.
Other documents.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Maybe you do, but right now I need you to
drop the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I told you I’ve got the evidence cold linking
this prick to Costello… You fuckin’ know who I am. I’m taking him
downstairs now.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I can’t wait for you to try to explain this
to a Suffolk County grand jury. This is gonna be fun.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: Just fucking kill me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I am killing you.</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>barrigan</strong>: Did you think you were the only one he
had? Costello was going to sell us to the FBI. It’s you and me now. We
have to take care of each other. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: All right. Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: At that time, Trooper Barrigan, who I now
understand to have been Francis Costello’s informer in SIU, intercepted
us in the lobby and shot Trooper William Costigan once in the head. At
that time Barrigan retrieved Trooper Costigan’s undercover weapon and
shot Trooper Brown as he was approaching our location. I attempted to
subdue Trooper Barrigan and in the ensuing struggle was struck several
times with the Walther pistol. I was able to wrestle the weapon away, at
which time Barrigan drew his own weapon and took aim at me. I was able
to get off a single shot, striking Barrigan in the head. I then checked
for vital signs of Troopers Brown and Costigan and discovered that they
had expired.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: I’d like to go on record that I am
recommending Trooper William Costigan for the Medal of Merit.</p>
<p><strong>colin</strong>: What about the baby?</p>
