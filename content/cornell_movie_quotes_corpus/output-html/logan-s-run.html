<h1 id="logan-s-run">logan-s-run</h1>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Wake up…come on, Logan-6.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You should’ve seen me take my last
Runner…perfect. I backed him up against a residence pool and when he
terminated…his hand… So now you’ve seen him…what’s the difference awake
or asleep?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Maybe, maybe not. What’s the difference?
Come on, Logan, let’s get out of here before everybody finds out.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Okay…you really want to wake him up?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hey, cut that out !</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Now you’ve done it…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Break-in scanners report intrusion,
identify.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Logan-5…Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant.
Intrusion accidental.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Clear Logan-5 and Francis-7.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sleep time…go to sleep. Sleeping time, little
ones.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You need a lift. Let’s go to Arcade and
celebrate… your alert successor…Logan-6.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies
are?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Not in my time…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: just wondered…what happens?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: but you don’t know, you Just say what
everyone says. One for one. One for one.”</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Well, why no!? That’s exactly how
everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -You have a
better idea?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Well the minute you get a better idea you
can stop wondering. You know, Logan – you wonder a lot. Too much for a
Sandman</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well? How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Too little.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Did you ever see Francis-8?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I don’t know what makes you so curious. You
have any idea who his seed-mother was?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: and that’s my friend, Logan. We’re
celebrating his next in line. Carousel - Arcade - who knows? Want to
come along?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You’re thirty – already? I always thought I
was older than you - Well, give it a good try.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s all right. Happy turn.</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: You’ll renew. I’ve got a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>2nd woman</strong>: I feel the same way. Sometimes I think
I’m not even going to try and renew when my time comes. But – that’s
three years away. So long.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Um-huh.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I guess you never had her?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You missed something special.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Well…you can’t have them all.</p>
<p><strong>logan and francis</strong>: But you can try.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: The damned Yellows are getting out of hand.
Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in
Arcade…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You should have been with us in Nursery,
Daniel. I’m positive I recognized him -</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Damn! That’s right. Just when I feel like
an ALL OUT BLAST in Arcade .</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Want me to take your shift? I’m feeling
restless anyway</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Now there’s a few who could have been his
seed-mother.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Only a few? You’re just not trying.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in
unison…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Crowd in a frenzy – SCREAMING.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Renew!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Renew!</p>
<p><strong>crowd’s chant</strong>: Renew!</p>
<p><strong>logan and francis</strong>: Renew!</p>
<p><strong>crowd’s chant</strong>: Re…</p>
<p><strong>57 full angle - the carousel</strong>: Other figures move to
the topmost level…straining for the rainbow bands.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Looks like I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Who invited you?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I’m in my party mood.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following
the running man in the great hall…empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING
in Carousel offstage.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Runner terminated 0:31 Ready for cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That was a great shot you made.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Yes. But you look a little rusty to me –
what were you doing, wondering?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: …Well I think you’re getting stale. You
need old Lucey–Go on. Gee the whole burn–try the new psycho-lift-they
tell me it turns you inside out…</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I’ll look for you here when I’m off–</p>
<p><strong>63x19 logan</strong>: Not with it. He turns and starts making
his way downwards towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What’s wrong, Available?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please . . .No.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Please . . . no ? You mean “not here”–that’s
it? You’re a private Available but particular, as he speaks, she
retreating, Don’t worry. There’s no one here but me. And you.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No. Just no.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You prefer women?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Well then…?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the
circuit. It was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sad? What made you sad?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight.
Now he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yes…probably he was renewed?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He was killed</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Killed? Why do you use that word?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Isn’t it right? Isn’t that what you do?
Kill.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I never ‘killed’ anybody in my life. Sandmen
terminate Runners Who brought you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Nobody. I felt sad. .. I put myself on the
circuit.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You felt sad. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re beautiful. Let’s have sex.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: But you put yourself on the circuit!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I thought I had to do something.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I changed my mind</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Curious.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: How a Sandman lives.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Let’s have sex. I thought you were
curious.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Not about that.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m afraid to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m not armed. Well?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why is it wrong to run?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You shouldn’t even think such things… And you
picked a strange person to say them to -</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I suppose. But what if you want to
live?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for
renewal.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: When this turns black…that’s it. If for any
reason you want to be 31… you have the same chance as everyone
else…Carrousel.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Six. I go red next year.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re years away . . . I don’t know why
you’re thinking of these things, much less talking about them. Want to
try?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What Quad do you live in?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s nice to know you can nod.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s nice co know you can do that, too.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: These are for me – you’ve got your own. She
must have been something–?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>sandman</strong>: Ran into some Cubs I couldn’t manage. One
of them cut me bad… a finger from his shoulder to all the way down.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Get yourself a new face while you’re at it
They know you now.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I just might look in on New You 483
myself.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: You? Why? You’re already beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No – it’s that last Runner – someone in 483
was trying to help him.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: See you in the hydrotoner!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Negative. Question: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t understand?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question:</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: 1056 unaccounted for?!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Impossible! Question: Maybe they weren’t all
Runners. Maybe most of them reached Life Renewal on Carousel.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question: None of them reached renewal?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: But everyone believes that some….</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question: You mean nobody’s ever been
renewed?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question: What if I need help from another
Sandman?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question: I am six Red…how can I pretend to
be approaching Lastday?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: My Lifeclock… Question: My Life–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Question: Am I still six Red?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What the hell took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Did you ever see anybody renew?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: I think you’ve been skulling out too much.
First Nursery and now stupid questions.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Anybody we know?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Look….why don’t you get into the water….you
need it….more than I do.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m fine…. See you….</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: At Carousel tonight?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Location…female Green Six… name
Jessica…living in Quad K.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: She has.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You could have called me yourself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: But I wasn’t sure you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Here I am. Shall I come in?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I couldn’t get you out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m the most beautiful woman you’ve ever
seen, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Maybe…sure….</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thanks…but I have the choice.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Then it’s still no.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You can have any woman in the city. What do
you really want?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You know</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t believe you. There has to be
more.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why show me?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m going to run.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You know something.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: About running, dying what?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Both…running’s what I’m interested in.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I know what everyone knows. Try like hell
for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s different now. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: How can I?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: A Runner gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And then you killed him, right?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I let him go…believe me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t..</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please? What friends?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I never heard of a Sandman running . . .
ever. . .</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What can I do to make you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: He’s blinking…so what? Sandmen get old,
too.</p>
<p><strong>first man</strong>: But what if he’s telling the truth?</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: I say no. It’s not worth the risk.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I absolutely agree. He’s killed Runners for a
decade. He has no feelings.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He was born a Sandman. He had no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Neither do we.</p>
<p><strong>1st sandman</strong>: Thanks, Francis.</p>
<p><strong>1st sandman</strong>: Ah-h you love it. You’re afraid you’ll
miss a really good Run.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why Arcade Station?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Right at the station itself?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No - just there - on the first level. Don’t
look for us. We’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I think you can. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’m sorry. We all are. But he has heard about
Sanctuary – and that makes him dangerous to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: We’re counting on you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Are you here to help me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’re you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That’s tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I wish I could help you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Maybe you’ll chink of something…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I wish I knew what you think I know.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: If you did know, you’d tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Of course–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Tell me, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>1st sandman</strong>: Hey, Logan’s got a mean one tonight–
why don’t you–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: A Runner…Cathedral. A woman.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You’re not going, are you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Have you ever been through Cathedral?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They’re like beasts. Wild.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Maybe they’re angry because they’re grown
in meccano-breeders.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Some people say children need human
mothering.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother
could be.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m only telling you what I’ve heard…
Haven’t you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like…?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: When did you begin to question Lastday?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t remember exactly…except I was a
Green. What would you like to relive, Logan?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Attention passengers. Cathedral Station is a
personal risk area. Persons with business are warned to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’ve never been in this quadrant. Is that
Arcade off there?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Let me go first. Sometimes they’re waiting
just inside there–to rush you when it opens…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Quickly now–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Muscle? I don’t know that one.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s unauthorized. No good for any- one over
thirteen anyhow–shakes you to pieces–speeds everything up to a blur– you
can see what happens when some flying Cub tries to go through this on
muscle–splat!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m Mary 2.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where do you live, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why aren’t you in Nursery?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m very smart.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: When do you go up?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I never go upstairs. You’re a nice old
lady.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not here. Might be a decoy.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: a soft beeping which abruptly grows louder
and holds steady.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Runner!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t worry about her. We’ll have that one
later. Right now I think we’ve got a Runner and his pairup. And what a
Runner!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: We’re going to have ourselves a time, we
are. Right, Billy?!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m a Sandman!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I’d
never get him…but I cut him up good, I did.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: For me? Better feel sorry for your- self,
Sandman!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No, for you! How old are you, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out.
How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you’re
sixteen and you go green?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a
cub with a green flower? You’ll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you’re
on green, because they won’t let a green stay here. If you try to stay
the young ones will gut-rip you apart!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Let him suck Muscle! That’ll shut his
mouth! Let’s watch him shake himself to death!!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Give him some Muscle!!</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Shake him to death!!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We can rush him…we can take can take him
again, we can!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right! How many of you want this to be
Lastday?!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Come on, Billy…come on…you cut a Sandman,
didn’t you?!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Come on, Billy…cut me…Come on</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They’ve got someone else! Why would anybody
come here?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I’ll kill you!! I’ll kill you!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sanctuary? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: If they find you throw this hard enough to
break it. Then hold your breath till you get away…It’s blind gas.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: I almost believed her.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m ashamed. I was bringing you to be
killed.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Logan, I don’t know where Sanctuary is. But
if I take you to them, they’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Then - why don’t you leave me - go to them -
explain</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No. Not that either.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right. New You 483. I’ll find out
myself.</p>
<p><strong>sandman</strong>: What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Can you beat it….I’ve got the damn wrong
bag.</p>
<p><strong>sandman</strong>: You ought to put yourself on reliefcall,
Francis.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hello, Sandman.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Do you want to see Doc?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: We don’t get many Sandmen. I think
we’ve only had one other since I’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s all right with me. Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: My name’s Holly…Holly 13. In ancient
times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No - Look, I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Doc’ll be with you soon, Sandman.</p>
<p><strong>woman customer</strong>: Is this your first time?</p>
<p><strong>woman customer</strong>: No. But I hear he’s terrific. Have
you seen any of his work?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Just one.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Doc’s ready, Sandman.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s a real privilege, Sandman.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Thanks. I thought you’d be older. I ex-
pected a Red.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Your own work?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I designed it myself. What’ll it be …a face job
or a full-body job?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Just the face.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Fine….Holly will get you ready. You’re in good
hands, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Holly works here because she gets a lift out of
watching the Table… and other things. I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: He’s going to sterilize himself.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Do I have to undress?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Not for your face.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You shouldn’t have brought him here.</p>
<p><strong>jessica;</strong>: I didn’t bring him – what’s the
difference. He’s blinking. He wants to run.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Run!? He’s a Sandman.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I tell you he’s running. I know.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Maybe…Maybe. But I wish he’d gone somewhere
else. All right. He gets a face.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I like dark hair. Have him give you dark
hair.</p>
<p><strong>doc’s voice</strong>: All set?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Um huh. Would you take a picture of him, Doc?
I’d like you to give his face to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Do you have anything special in mind?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t care…Just get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Holly’d like dark hair.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Holly’d like a lot of things. We can start by
narrowing the cheekbones.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: An insistent chiming.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hello Yes Yes, they are. Done.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pay attention, Sandman. I’m proud of this
machine.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: With this one there’s no waiting for scar
burnishing. It’s all in one…watch now…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: But here’s the improvement. Instant
healing—before you feel a thing. Watch now…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Perfect depth adjustment on this one, Sandman.
The beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin
beneath– absolute precision. Watch now</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Of course, it doesn’t mend uniforms, Sandman,
but otherwise it does everything, doesn’t it? Just imagine what would
happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: No! You’re scrambling the table. He’ll be cut
to pieces, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Damn right! It was a trap. They know!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No - I’m Running!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It has nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What are you talking about?! I saw you let
a Runner go? I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Follow me, Logan. Stay close.</p>
<p><strong>wanton</strong>: I have an empty one, Sandman</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Are you taking me to them?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes. I don’t know what else to do – with
him following us. Why do you keep running from your–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Because he’s my friend - and I don’t want to
be killed by him - or anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s good, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Will he find us and kill us? Yes…or one of
the others. You know there’s only one place to go now…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’d rather take my chances with them…than
with Francis.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: They won�t listen.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: We’ll convince them.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes, Logan. I’m glad they didn’t change
your face.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hold still, Sandman, or die where you
are.</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: Is she the one?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m a runner. She brought me here because I
begged her to help me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He’s lying. No Sandman ever ran.</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: You don’t run. You kill runners. You have
killed runners all your life. -</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Yes I have. Now it’s my turn. And I want to
live.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Holly. Holly, New You 483… He’s dead. Doc’s
dead and the Sandmen came…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: It’s him! The first Sandman. He
killed…Doc.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, Holly–wait! He’s running. Tell them the
rest!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Holly. Holly! Please…The other Sandman.
Remember the one who came after–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: May we move?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I saw we pass them through. Somebody help
Holly.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You two. Just go straight ahead. Follow the
corridors with the pipes overhead to the end. Then use the key.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I don’t know who you are. I’d like to thank
someone.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It doesn’t matter who we are. Follow the
tunnel to the end.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I Will there be someone to tell us where to
go from there…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Someone will follow. When you come to the
lock, he will tell you how Co go on the other side. Jessica may go with
you as far as the lock.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.
Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Why?- No…no…I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>voice1</strong>: Only to the lock. After that there’s no way
back.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why, Jessica? You’re still a green.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Come on then–they’ll be here any minute!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Logan. I know you’re in here. What’ve you
done…gone crazy over a Runner? Nobody knows except me. You know I won’t
say anything. I should have turned you in but I couldn’t. Leave her.
Come on out with me. It’ll look like you’re part of the group that hit
this nest. Logan…you’re a Sandman! Logan…now…now…Logan…</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A WHIRRING like clockwork…A METALLIC BELL
SOUND and then a</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Runner, this is the last gate. Use your key
now. When the Bell sounds again…use your key. Good luck, Runner. May you
find Sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Wait - I have the one I took from the
Runner.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: The same as before as Logan searches his
pockets for the Runner’s ankh.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: There’s no turning back, is there?</p>
<p>****: The action of the sequence is the action of people groping
through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They run
into blind endings and retrace to the last junction – always trying for
what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: How do we know this is the right way?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s the only way.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What do you suppose this was…?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Some kind of breeding pens…I suppose…They say
people used to breed animal s, fish, anything To eat, of course.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ycch. To kill things and then eat them. It
must have been a savage world.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: FOOTSTEPS, coming, halting, WATER sloshing.
Steps again.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s Francis, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s brighter there…besides, we can’t go
back.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It doesn’t make any difference anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You’re really one of us now, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You knew that I wasn’t before, didn’t you?
Why did you stay with me?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I had to. I did kill…for the first time in my
life I killed.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Because you felt like a Runner, didn’t
you.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I guess so…I know I felt something I never
felt before…and I didn’t like it…not a bit. I’ll tell you one
thing…Sanctuary better be worth it. That’s the last place for me to live
now.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: For us.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Overwhelming, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Are you too startled? Am I too removed from
your ken? I’m neither machine nor man…but a perfect fusion of the
two…and better than either. No human sculptor could match this
greatness…don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right - what are you?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Ah, but wait for the winds. Then my birds sing.
My walrus breathes. My palace chimes and bells. And the deep grottoes
whisper my name…Box Box…Bahhhhxxxxsss…</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Anything to eat?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: This place is a link to Sanctuary, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: You walked in. I saw you. Don’t you
remember?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: From? From? From?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We were sent here and you know it. Others
have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where do we go?! Where do we go from
here??!!</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Is that the wind? Not yet… You must hear my
birds sing.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You
have to help us! You don’t have a choice! It isn’t your decision!! Tell
us.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Never a pair. I have never had a pair.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where do you send them?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: You’re a beautiful pair.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: I’ve never seen humans whom I thought worthy of
being here… I’d like to sculpt you. Where would I put you? I know…you’d
be the base of the column. You’d hold up my world!</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Do you know how long all this will last? Not
thirty years…or thirty thousand years…but thirty thousand thousand
years…and you’ll be part of it. Ages will roll…Ages. And you’ll be
here…the two of you… eternally frozen…frozen…beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That’s better. How do you want us?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Nude. Imagine, a pair.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How do you want us?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Enchanting. Is that what humans do?</p>
<p><strong>box’s voice</strong>: Superb!</p>
<p><strong>box’s voice</strong>: Done…Done…Done…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: All right. Now you keep your bargain.</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Regular storage procedure…the same as the other
food… The other food stopped coming and they started.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What other food?</p>
<p><strong>box</strong>: Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from
the sea. It’s all here - ready - fresh as harvest day. Fish and
plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea…And then it stopped coming
and they came instead. So I store them here. I’m ready. And you’re
ready. It’s my Job - protein, plankton, grass from the sea</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Tell us how to get out…or I�ll destroy
you..I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Ice melting, water running.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A heavy crash and splash as another huge ice
block falls into the water.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Is there something on fire!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It seems to be moving away. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It feels like breath. It makes everything
move. Your hair is moving.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Jessica – we must be outside!</p>
<p><strong>288xa1 francis</strong>: Coming out through the fissure in
the rock, squinting at the unexpected light from the sky, then setting
out as Logan and Jessica did.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sooner or later, we’ll have to try
something</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They’re good.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s getting dark and cold. I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Why don’t we rest here? We know we can eat
these.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where do you think that heat-ball went?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you think everything’s going to turn to
ice?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t ever let go.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It all seemed to make sense until Box.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you think he was telling the Truth?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You’re right…it must be near now. We’ll find
it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Logan!!!Look!! No…your palm…look!!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Then the answer’s Yes…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I have never seen a face like that before. It
must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: They all have names and numbers on them. I
wonder what they are?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: “Beloved Husband”. “Beloved Wife”. What can
all that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Francis?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: HAMMERING NOISE – irregular. It stops after a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: As old as I am I suppose…who knows ?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Your hair is white.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It wasn’t always. I remember when it wasn’t.
But it wasn’t your color either. …or yours. I have my color
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Those cracks in your face…do they hurt?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Could I touch them?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh, my…please try.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ve forgotten. It’s been so long since I’ve
used it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But all of my cats have names.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Is that what they’re called– cats?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes, cats, of course. What else could they
be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: But there are so many of them. Do you know
each one separately.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes indeed, everyone. Actually, they all
have three. “The naming of cats is a difficult matter. It isn’t just one
of your holiday games. You may think at first I’m mad as a hatter when I
tell you a cat must have THREE</p>
<p><strong>different names.”</strong>: An ordinary name and a fancy
name. That’s two. Do you want to guess what the third one is?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How long have you been living here?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: For as long as I can remember.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What kind of place is this?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Just a place, I suppose…who knows?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I have always been here…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Are there any other humans?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Gracious…no.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Have any other people ever passed
through?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: But there may be a few around
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What makes you think so?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: My parents thought so. Mother and Father.
You know?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And…and how were you grown? Inside your
mother?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Mother and Father said so… you know?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Dead…they’re dead…and buried.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: May I see your hand again?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: They’re beautiful. May I have one too
please?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: No–I’m sorry. It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m sorry but I don’t have anything to give
you.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Here you can have this.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What kind of jewel is this?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: You’re both full of secrets like Macavity.
Did you steal this?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: “Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like
Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.”</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What’s beyond this place - do you know?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: No, no, no</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Did your Mother or Father ever mention
another place?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Never, never, ever. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: May we stay here for a while? We’d like to
rest.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Of course you can stay. This belongs to the
people.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What belongs to the people?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: All this. All of it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What people?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I don’t know…but it does.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I’ll be right back. Oh, yes…about the cats…
one rule is true: “Don’t speak till you are spoken to.”</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That sweet madman – how could he Come to
exist?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He had a mother and father – and he knew
them.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: One in a million, I suppose</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: There’s nothing to go on to, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: There’s a Sanctuary…there is!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You want there to be one…that Doesn’t…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh, my don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: That’s the same fellow who’s outside. If he
was so important - why isn’t he first?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: What did you do to him?</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Why? Why you? Do you know you ruined him?
Do you know that? Can you tell me why? Why you? And now you’ve killed
him, you know…</p>
<p><strong>francis’ voice</strong>: Here!!!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Look at your palm, Francis…. look! It’s
clear. Clear!</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Why did you do that??!!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I didn’t do anything, Francis! They’ve made
us believe that….</p>
<p><strong>francis</strong>: Logan! You renewed!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh, my…he died…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: We�ll have to bury him.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: They�re put into the ground so they can be
visited by the living…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I�ll make the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Are you ready to put him in?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>old man’s voice</strong>: “Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet
there in the fragrant silent night.”</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Of course…that’s settled then. But just you
remember your promise…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: We’ll remember. But that’s a long time
off…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: What are we promising him? What can we
possibly give him?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He asked if we would bury him when his time
comes.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m going to try and tell people what we’ve
seen and–</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Do you expect me to let things go on without
trying to change them?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Things won’t change…you know that! We can
live here together, Logan… have a life as long as his… together!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You want to go back to kill, is that it?!
Now, you’ll want to kill your own!!! kill Sandmen!!! Killing’s all you
ever…!!!!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I want to be alive and with you, that’s all
I want.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I know…I know…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What a pity. I was hoping you’d be here to
bury me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Come with us.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: To a city with thousands and thousands of
people.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Alive?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Thousands and thousands…as many as my
cats?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: More…many more.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: And all alive you say?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes, I would like to see that. Is it a long
journey?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I promise. We ’11 go on as soon as it’s
light.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: That’s better than gold when it’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Thank you. Tell me - what do those words
mean? “Beloved husband�…�Beloved son”… “Beloved wife”’…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: My father was the husband and my mother was
the wife. “Beloved” is a word they used - to stay together.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Stay? They lived together all their
years?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh, yes…I think…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And Sanctuary?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Sanctuary is the right to live…. nothing
more. But nothing less, either….</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What does that water do?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: It’s part of the hydrogalvanic system. The
ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Is it inside the city?</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Of course. I don’t know where… I Just took
them for granted. It’s our only chance.</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: Can you make it back?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh my…I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Oh, my…</p>
<p><strong>logan’s voice</strong>: No!! Don’t go in there !!</p>
<p><strong>logan</strong>: You don’t have to die!! No one has to die at
thirty!!! You don’t have to blink out on Lastday. There’s no renewal on
Carrousel! You can live longer and grow old… I’ve seen it. She’s seen
it!! Believe me!!</p>
<p><strong>a. first head speaks</strong>: A Jewelry store.</p>
