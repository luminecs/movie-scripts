<h1 id="viridiana">viridiana</h1>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Sister Viridiana.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Mother?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I’ve just had a letter from your
uncle. He won’t be able to come when you take your vows.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: All right, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You don’t seem to mind very
much.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I hardly know him. I saw him only once,
some years ago. I can’t even remember him.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: In any case he’s asking you to come
and stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I don’t want to leave the convent,
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I’m afraid that his health is not
good. He’s your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him
before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: But why does he want to see me? He has
never bothered about me.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: He has paid for your studies and
your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so
little to you, Viridiana?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I have no desire to see the world again,
but if you order me to…</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: The retreat will start soon. You
can leave tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Everything you need for the journey
has been put in your cell. Go get yourself ready, and try to show him
some affection.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: That’s enough for today, Rita. Do you
like that rope I gave you?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s easier to jump with: it’s got
handles.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Go away now. Go and play.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Welcome, miss. I’m Ramona, Don Jaime’s
servant.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Ah! Pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Viridiana!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Yes, Uncle. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I’m well … The bus was late, wasn’t it? …
What was the journey like?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Excellent. What a charming, peaceful
place, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You’ll think you’re still at the
convent.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: How long are you staying?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: A very short while, Uncle. I’ve been
given permission to stay only a few days.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Was that difficult to get?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: No. Mother Superior told me to come.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Did you have so little interest in seeing
me?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: To tell you the truth, not very much. I
cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you
everything materially, but otherwise …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You have no feelings toward …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You are right. Being alone has made me
self-centered. Now I am sorry we have not seen more of each other. It’s
too late, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Yes. It’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You’ve been neglecting the farm,
Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: In twenty years the grass has invaded
everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first
floor. I hardly ever go out.</p>
<p><strong>rita’s voice</strong>: It’s true. When he goes out he makes
me jump rope.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Come down here, you scamp.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: My maid Ramona’s daughter. She’s a little
animal.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Come down.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: How like your aunt you are, even in your
walk.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I know, Uncle, you’ve told me that
already.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You see, even the voice.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: She has made her bed on the floor, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: She has something in her suitcase that looks
like thorns. Her nightgown is made of some rough cloth. It really must
tear her skin! Such beautiful skin, sir.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Leave me now. You can go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Yes, sir. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good morning, Rita. How are we today?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Today, a good girl.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Could I trouble you for my glass of
milk?</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Certainly, miss.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Is that difficult?</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Here, try it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: But I wouldn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: I’ll show you. Hold here.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Pull hard like that and squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I can’t. It makes me …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: It makes me feel …</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I saw you in your nightgown!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yes, yes, I saw you!</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Don’t take her seriously, she’s a liar.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I saw her! I saw her … When she was dressing,
her pins fell out and she picked them up.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: How did you see me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: From the terrace.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: It’s very wicked to spy. Why did you do
it?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m going to the hen house. Are you
coming with me?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: No, I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime’s voice</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good morning, Uncle. You’re very early
this morning.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m going to make you a nun’s cake. It
will make your mouth water.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You are spoiling me too much. I won’t
know what to do with myself when you’ve gone.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Only because you want it.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Nothing. I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You don’t trust me, do you? What do you
want to know?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Very well! I’m talking to you like this
because I can’t keep things to myself.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Is it true that you have a son?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: How did you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Oh, some years ago I heard my mother
talking about it. But is it true?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t you ever see him?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: How could anybody behave like that?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Sometimes these things happen because of
inexperience. Sometimes it’s because of…</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Evil.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: And what do you know about life? When all
is said and done you couldn’t possibly understand.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I understand perfectly. But even if you
were not entirely blameworthy, you should have brought up the child.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: His mother wanted to keep him. She came
from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have
acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That’s why I didn’t say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: And this innocent child.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Don’t worry. He won’t be forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You must think I am a monster.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: No, but what a pity life is like
that.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: The poor little beast. It was going to
drown.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime’s voice</strong>: Is she up yet?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: She’s been up for some time.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: She asked me to get her things ready.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Her last day in this house! I’ll never
see her again if she leaves.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Why don’t you ask her to stay on for a few
days?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I have asked her but she’s ungrateful.
Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent,
she turns to stone.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Ramona!</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Come here, Ramona.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Sit down, I’m going to need your
help.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I’d be really ungrateful, if I didn’t like
you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn’t know where to
turn.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Yes, yes, but there’s no need to bring
that up. How far are you prepared to help me?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Just say the word, sir, and I’ll do
anything.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Why don’t you speak to her, Ramona? Women
are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her
stay a few more days. You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don’t
need to offer you anything, but, if you’re successful in this, I’ll not
forget you or your little girl.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: But sir, what can I say to her? And why
should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You’re right, but we must do
something.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You must think what the best thing to do is,
and I’ll help you to my utmost.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Look in the cupboard. On the upper shelf,
there’s a little blue bottle. There’s no label on it. You’ll find some
white pills inside.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: This one, sir?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Yes, leave it there. Go on with what you
were doing. I’ll tell you what to do later.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I have never been able to do that. I’m
too nervous.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Why didn’t you wake me?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: They say it’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I don’t believe it. A few years ago – the
last time I walked in my sleep – they woke me up by slapping my face.
And you can see I’m still alive. What worries me is that I put ashes on
your bed.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Why? It’s no more odd than anything else.
People who walk in their sleep don’t know what they’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and
death.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Then it’s penance for you who are going
to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it’s death …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: If you like, I will come with you
tomorrow to the village when you leave.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Thank you, Uncle.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: This evening we must do something special
by way of a farewell.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Whatever you like.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I should like you to do something for me.
It’s an innocent sort of thing but I’m very set on it.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Today I can refuse you nothing.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You’ll do what I ask, then?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Whatever you wish. I’m at your
command.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: No, wait … What a silly thing! It’s quite
difficult for me to tell you what it is.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: How strange you are! When I asked you to
do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now,
here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my
child!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I don’t like masquerading, but as you see
I decided to give in to your whim.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: It’s not a masquerade, nor is it a whim.
I’m going to tell you something that few people know.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Your aunt died of a heart attack, in my
arms, on our wedding night, wearing that dress, and you look so like her
…</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You must think I’m mad.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: No, Uncle, and now I’m pleased to have
been able to do this favor, because, although I didn’t think so at
first, you are really a good man.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: If you only knew … When I was young I was
full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others,
something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to
do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I
felt like a fool … and so I went back into my shell.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Wasn’t that cowardice?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: No, it isn’t that, I can assure you. I
wouldn’t be afraid in the face of real danger. I’ve proved that to
myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello,
I’d be alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I can’t take my eyes off you. Come, let’s
sit down.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Uncle, you mustn’t think that I won’t be
sad to leave you.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: It’s up to you entirely. Don’t leave,
then …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Unfortunately …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: It’s my fault. If I’d come to see you
more often, if I’d invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would
be different.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Maybe …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: There’s one way you could stay. If I
asked …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I mean .. . if I said to you …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: No, I can’t … I can’t …</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What he wants, miss, is to marry you.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Excuse me, sir, but I only said what you
didn’t dare say yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: He loves you very much and he deserves to be
loved in return, because he is a very good man.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You’re really serious?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Yes, I don’t want you ever to leave this
house.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You must be out of your mind. I’ve been
so happy these last few days – now you’ve spoiled it all.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I think it would be better if I went to
my room.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Wait! Forgive me! Honestly, I really beg
your pardon. Stay a few more minutes! If you go now, I’m afraid you’ll
always resent me. I promise not to say anything that might annoy you.
I’ll put some music on and we’ll have a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Take this, miss, it’ll do you good.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Why are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Don’t invent stories; go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: A black bull came.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: A black bull!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: It’s a very big one.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Very, very?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Yes – very, very big!</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: He couldn’t get through the door, then?</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Then how did it get in, silly?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He came in through the cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: You little liar! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Here! And call your mother if you’re having
nightmares. Now go away and don’t annoy me.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You look very tired. Perhaps you’d better
go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Viridiana! Viridiana! …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime’s voice</strong>: Help me …Take her by the
legs.</p>
<p><strong>ramona’s voice</strong>: Lift her a little more, sir…</p>
<p><strong>don jaime’s voice</strong>: Don’t think too badly of me,
Ramona; I only want to have her close to me.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime’s voice</strong>: That will be all, Ramona.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don Jaime was kissing the lady.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: He only kisses her because she’s his niece.
Don’t I kiss you? You should be in bed.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: A black bull came into my room.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Be quiet. I’m going to put you to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: That will soon pass. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: What happened to me?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You fainted last night after supper. The
master and I carried you here.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Have I slept long?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Oh, you slept well; don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Leave us alone, Ramona.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t go!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Leave me alone, uncle, please. I want to
get up.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I have to go!</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: No. You can never go away now.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Last night you promised never to speak of
that again. I beg you, leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: What could be more unlike than an old man
who lives alone and a young woman like you, consecrated to God. However
…</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Be quiet! I don’t want to listen to you!
Don’t you understand that I want to get dressed?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I forgot everything because of you, even
the passion that has kept me going all these years … everything.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I must have been mad. I thought that you
would agree to marry me, but naturally you refused. And now it’s the day
that you must leave.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I had to force you. That was the only way
I could find to have you in my arms.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: No, it’s true. Last night when you were
sleeping, I had you all to myself.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Now you won’t be able to go back to your
convent. You’re not the same woman who left it a few days ago. Now,
you’ll have to stay with me here forever.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Everything I have will be yours, and if
you don’t want to marry me, if you prefer to live as we have up to now,
provided you’re close to me, I’ll content myself with …</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Think about it. Don’t hurry. Think it
over.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Go away! Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: What did you say to her, sir?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: The way she looked at me, Ramona! She
hates me now. I think I’ve made a great mistake. She’s going away, she’s
going away and nothing will stop her.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Speak to her again. Explain everything to
her seriously.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: What for? She’ll only look at me that way
again … I couldn’t. You go. Perhaps she’ll listen to you. Try to
convince her.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: But what can I say to her, sir?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Tell her I lied, that I didn’t take
advantage of her.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: I did mean to do it, Ramona. But I
realized in time what I was doing. I spent the whole night turning my
thoughts over in my mind … and I lied to her so she wouldn’t go back to
the convent. Go on, explain to her.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Sir, come right away.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Let me pass!</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You must listen to me before you go.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’ve listened to you long enough. Let me
out.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: All that I said just now was a lie. I
said it so you wouldn’t leave. I only molested you in my thoughts … I
can’t bear to have you leave me, hating me like this. Tell me you
believe what I’m saying and I’ll let you go.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You disgust me… even if what you say is
true.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Then you won’t forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: You believe me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: Don’t lie. You don’t believe me
either.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: It’s only that … It’s all very odd, sir.</p>
<p><strong>don jaime</strong>: It’s all right, my girl, it’s all
right.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: See how high I can throw it!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look! You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Look! Moncho! Look how high it is!</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Let me have a little peace, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: When you’re ready, miss.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’ll take your bag, please, miss.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: How do you do, Miss Viridiana!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: You cannot leave …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: There’s been an accident.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Give it to me. It’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: I’ll box your ears if you don’t show some
respect for the dead! You mustn’t play under this tree.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: If something terrible happens now it will be
your fault.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You aren’t eating enough. I’ve given you a
glass of milk, and this evening I’ll bring you some meat.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You don’t look at all well! The mayor told
me that he’s dealing with the problems you were talking about. You can
go to the village when you want to. It’ll do you good to see the
world.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Good morning. You weren’t expecting
me, were you?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You must have suffered, my
child!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Ever since yesterday, when we heard
by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why
didn’t you write? I would have come immediately.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I had so many things to think about!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: A suicide is horrible. I know. But
you should have told me.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: I talked for a few minutes to the
parish priest in the village and he told me how it happened. Everybody
is asking why this horrible offense was committed against Our Lord. Do
you know the reason?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I only know that my uncle was a grave
sinner and I feel guilty for his death.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: How can you say that! You,
responsible for the suicide of a man? I want a complete confession from
you.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m not going back to the convent;
therefore I’m no longer under obedience to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Is there some grave impediment
which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I have nothing to reproach myself for.
All I know is that I’ve changed. With all my strength, which is not
much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also
serve outside a convent.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Are you aware of the pride there is
in what you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: What great plans are you thinking
of dedicating yourself to now?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I know my own weakness, and whatever I do
will be humble. But, however little it is, I want to do it alone.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Very well. As you won’t let me help
you, I must leave you. I’m very sorry I came and disturbed you.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Forgive me if I have offended you.</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: You are forgiven. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: Why isn’t she coming?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: She has already crossed herself.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: She’s a very firm believer.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: I’ve heard she’s even going to pay us to go
and live with her.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Kind people! Don’t forget a poor blind
man.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: There she is. Hurry up, come on. You’ve had it
if you totter around like that and fool with the kids.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Give the little girl to me. Come here,
sweetheart. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: When you are, miss.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good, then let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: She has the face of an angel. What a pity you
can’t see her.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Right, let’s go. And keep the compliments
to yourself. I don’t like them.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are you the other two?</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Yes, miss, that’s us, yes.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good, come with me.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I’m not at all bitter about it. Anyone can
love and forget. But … Why did he acknowledge me at the last moment?
What was going through his mind?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: He was very good. Better than some people
would think.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Why did he kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I don’t know, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: One shouldn’t be alone the whole time. I’m
not like him, am I?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Not in that way; you’re always looking for
company.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl
is a bit jealous.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Don’t play, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I beg your pardon, sir. The master used to
play here by the hour. It was a real delight to listen to him.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: If you don’t mind, I’ll go get the other
suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Look at these beautiful fields! And behind
those pines the fields, dried up and abandoned. There’s so much to do
here and it’s all mine. We won’t have time to get bored.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Aren’t you happy?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Yes. But I don’t know … I wish I hadn’t
come.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: It’s very big …</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: So much the better. We’ll all fit. How
many floors are there?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Are there many windows?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Lots. It’s got balconies and two big
towers.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Then it’s a respectable house.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Have you repaired the windows of the
dormitories?</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: They shut all right now. And the blankets
are ready.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: That miss is as good as gold.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: She’s very good, but a bit of a
simpleton.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: The men will sleep on one side, the women
on the other, but we will eat together. We’ll try to get you some decent
clothes tomorrow. Moncho, show them where they’ll be. I’ll take the
women.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Viridiana.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Miss Viridiana …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are you Jorge?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Jorge, Don Jaime’s son, at your service.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’ve been expecting you; I got a letter
from the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: This is Lucia; she’s a good girl. You’ll get
to know each other very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don’t touch me! You’re going to sleep in the
farmyard with the chickens!</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Get moving! Anyone who pokes around where he
shouldn’t be will pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Listen, although we may be poor, every
man has his dignity, brother.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Don’t “brother” me: there aren’t any scum in
my family.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: Well now, even the servants put on airs here,
don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Do you want me to smash your face?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: What’s going on, Moncho?</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: This louse is looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: You runt.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t talk like that!</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: I’ll talk the way I want to. I’ve had enough
of this.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: That’ll teach you some manners.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: Blind, shit! You can see now.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: In you go! Moncho, lead the way! You stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: But, miss …</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Leave her.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Keep calm, Moncho. And you… …don’t be
quarrelsome!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Would you mind telling me what I did
wrong to you to deserve your insults?</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: I’ve had a gutful of this.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: If you want to stay you’ll have to
exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to
everybody.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: If that’s the way, it’s better to leave.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: Give me something to go on with.</p>
<p><strong>pelon</strong>: Because we are poor, without it …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I nearly walked my legs off today. That has
done me good.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Why don’t you let me do that, miss?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Because I’ve got him into bad habits.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Whenever you’re ready I can serve
supper.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Right, we’ll have it now.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Why the bad temper?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: It’s Viridiana. She’s getting on my
nerves.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: She’s mad.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: No, not mad at all: she’s rotten with
religion.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Let her do what she wants. She doesn’t bother
us in any way. She minds her business and we …</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Do you know what I think? What’s annoying you
is that she pays so little attention to you.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Ramona!</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: That’s the last straw! What were you looking
at, woman? Look what you’ve done!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: So, Ramona!</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: Run and get something to mop it up with,
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: That woman’s getting more and more stupid
every day.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What of it?</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: When I wasn’t so miserable I used to
sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: So you didn’t come from the poorhouse!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: I’ll hit whoever said that.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Don’t pay any attention to him, Don Amalio,
he’s a rogue.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Good evening, miss.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Benedictus!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Make room for your new companions. You
sit there, you there. I guess they’re hungry, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: God will reward you.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Have you eaten well? Did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: I don’t want to criticize the saintly
miss who is so good to us, but I would take the liberty of saying that
the beans were acid.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Sour, idiot.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Don’t pay any attention to them, they’re
peasants.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: If Don Zequiel says the beans were bad it
must be true. We’ll do something about it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Now I’ve got some good news for you. From
tomorrow on, everyone will have some work to do.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t worry, you won’t be asked to do
anything impossible or anything you won’t want to do. I only want you to
have a bit of a change and to take some exercise.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: I’m a cook, miss, I’m good at roasts and
vanilla puddings. Last year I made pastry for the Companza people. They
can still remember it.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You can help me with the accounts.</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Yes, miss.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: I can paint religious pictures … Before, I
used to be able to write, but now with this leg I’ve forgotten …</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: I can weave hemp, but with the rheumatism in
my fingers …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: What about you, Manuel?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: I’m only good at making people laugh.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: That’s all right; we all laugh here, but
not at you; I’ll see to that.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: I’ve got green fingers. The priest will
tell you …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: So you won’t get bored here, there’ll be
more than enough for you to do!</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Look! It’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: That’s leprosy.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Throw him out, miss! We’re all clean
here.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: They’re varicose veins, miss, but some days I
can’t take care of them.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are you sure it isn’t contagious?</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: They told me it isn’t at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t listen to him, miss. I’ve known him for
a long time.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: They’re varicose veins. It isn’t leprosy.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’ll take him to the doctor tomorrow.
Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he
were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to
bed. Everyone in bed by eight o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: If you don’t disappear, I’ll make holes in
your belly.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: You’re not the one to make me move.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: The miss, she understands, she told me I
could stay.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Hit him if he doesn’t get out!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Calm down, people, calm down. Somebody
will get hurt. If anything happens, we’ll all be thrown out.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Out, the turd!</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Okay, that’s it, I give in, but I’m staying
on the grounds. All together you’d be able …</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Give me something for tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: I’ll come to you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: No, the children sleep with me.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Give them to Refugio.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: No, I don’t want to because they yell. And
I’ve got news for you too.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Then I’ll get you in the fields tomorrow
…</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Jorge. You frightened me. What’s
happening to you?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: It’s about time we spoke to each other, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Well… is it so urgent?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: If I wait until tomorrow, it’ll be the same
as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you’re not
with your poor people, you’re praying or you disappear, I never see
you.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I don’t know anything about these things,
Jorge …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: But you have a right to let us know what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m not interested. Do what you think’s
best.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Is that everything?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: No, it isn’t; there’s much more. It seems
absurd for us to be staying here so near each other in this situation
without knowing each other.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What do you know about me?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I know that you used to work with an
architect.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: And do you know that my mother and I had to
suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I’d be
an architect now.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t understand how you can like being
alone so much.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m not like you, you have your wife.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: We’re not married. I don’t need anybody’s
blessing to live with a woman.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I see that you … I ought to go. Good
night.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: The next time you come, knock first and
wait until I tell you to come in.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: I’ll put some yellow in her face to show she
is ill.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Hurry up, I’m cramped all over.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: It’s nearly finished, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: I don’t like having to stay still for so
long.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: It seems to me that you ought to know damn
well how to swing your…</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: She looks like a sick marrow!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t pay any attention to him. It’s very
good.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: I don’t like having to be the Virgin.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: You ought to be the one in bed. I’d like to
ask you, miss, to pose…</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be
really pretty.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: It won’t take but a minute. It’s a votive
offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our
Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Do you have great devotion for the
Virgin?</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: I’m not a bigot, miss, but everybody has his
own beliefs … and then …with this terrible thing … … if I didn’t have
faith …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I must know when you expect to give
birth.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Heavens! So the doctor can be warned.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: In that case in about four months, but I
can’t tell you exactly.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: She doesn’t even know who the father was. She
said that it was night and she couldn’t even see his head.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: I didn’t expect you to scream it from the
house tops.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Shut up. You shouldn’t speak like that
in front of our holy protector who is a well-bred person.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m very sorry for you. Have you any
other children!</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: No, miss, it will be the first. Do you
mind…?</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: We’re going to the village, miss …</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: With God’s and your own permission.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: They must bring me some potatoes, bacon,
and rice.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Take it and be careful not to be as late
as you were yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Could they bring me some tobacco?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel
ill.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Smoking makes me feel ill? It’s these
filthy fag ends. I won’t mention in this company what’s upsetting
you.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: That’ll do. Bring the tobacco and I’ll
distribute it.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Thank you, miss.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: It’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Thank you; but it’s missing something.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: That doesn’t matter; I like it.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: How much is that?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Fifteen yards.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: That’s fifteen by seven?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>one policeman</strong>: Thanks, pal, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: Goodbye: if you ever need anything …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: That animal can’t take any more. Now that the
wagon’s empty, why don’t you let him ride?</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: It’s for people!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Then let him go and he’ll follow you.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: And let him get run over by somebody
else?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I’ll buy him.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: He’s good at rabbiting and he knows it.
When we’re in the country, if he doesn’t hunt he doesn’t get fed.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: How much do you want for him?</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: I wasn’t thinking of selling him, but if
you want … I’ll leave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: All right, untie him.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: Thank you, and God keep you and bless you.
Get moving.</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: And remember, the less he eats, the better
he runs.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What’s he called?</p>
<p><strong>peasant</strong>: Canelo!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Be quiet! Where are you going? Come here,
Canelo! Canelo! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Have you thought of what you want planted
yet?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: The fields have been left so long; with a
good manuring anything will grow.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: It’s for wheat. We’ve always grown maize in
the strip above the vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: And in the vegetable plot?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: That’s good land.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What a miracle, you let yourself be seen.
Have you come to look at the work?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’ve told you before I’m not interested
in this.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: The best thing my father left me was the
land. You can see the result of the work on it, and if you helped me it
wouldn’t take long to change it even more.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What are you doing here? Get out.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You won’t get much done with those people.
Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Do they worry you that much, then?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: They worry me a great deal, and especially
because of you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: There’s no point in helping some of them when
there are so many others.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I know perfectly well how little I can
do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a
bit of human warmth.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Is that all you’re going to devote your life
to?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’m not sure yet. I’ve had a shock
recently, and I’m only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I’ll go back to
the convent one day.</p>
<p><strong>workmen’s voices</strong>: Put your things somewhere else!
Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Swine.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on; ask him.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: These rascals are demons. They’ve tied a
can to him. Because they find the poor guy revolting, they make him walk
with this can so they know when he’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Why did you come here, Jos�? I told you
where to go until you’re cured.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: The weather is wonderful, the sun is warm, so
I keep on walking and walking … then you see …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Things seem to be getting better.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Hold your arm out. You can’t hope to be
cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in
time …This’ll take time. But with the help of God, we’ll pull
through.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Stretch out your arm.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: It all started one unlucky day. A punishment
from God because one windy day I was with a woman and after that I
started to be punished. You’re the first good woman I’ve seen; if all
women were as bad as the priests say, you wouldn’t take care of me. You,
bad? He shakes his head and laughs stupidly.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are your parents alive?</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what’s the use
of them!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Right, I won’t say that, but I still think
they’re no use.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Don’t pay any attention, miss; this man’s no
good. He wants you to catch it too. At church, he puts his arm into the
Holy Water and seems to say would to God all those damn women got it.
The priest won’t let him in.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: You’ll soon find out, you liar!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Stop this!</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: He’s lying through his ass!</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Ask the priest, miss.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: That’s enough. Go join the others, and
don’t come back here. And you’ll have to control your temper.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: This must have been my grandfather’s.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: If you wake first, wake me up.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What I do every day, but I want to do it
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: You’re happy, aren’t you!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Shouldn’t I be? You, on the other hand …</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: I’m bored. I’m alone all day and I don’t know
what to do.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You should have enough to do in this house …
Come here and listen to this.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: That your cousin is more to your taste.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: She isn’t my cousin.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: It doesn’t make any difference what she is:
you like her.</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: I had a feeling I shouldn’t have come here.
I’d better get out, fast …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: We ought to talk about that some other
time.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: How in hell does it wind up?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: I think I’d better go tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Don’t be a fool! Why rush away from something
which couldn’t happen?</p>
<p><strong>lucia</strong>: You see how much you like her?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: That’s life. Some people are brought
together, others are separated. What can we do, if that’s the way it
happens?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Lucia! Don’t cry! Come on, darling, don’t cry
like that!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What a thing! Where did Father find that?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another
trip?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: No, sir, it’s nearly six o’clock. Okay,
let’s get a move on! When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Tonight, but I’ll be back tomorrow
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: The Angelus.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: The Angel of the Lord declared to
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>beggars</strong>: And she conceived by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with thee
blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana’s voice</strong>: Behold the handmaid of the
Lord.</p>
<p><strong>beggars’ voices</strong>: Be it done unto me according to thy
word. Hail Mary full of grace …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana’s voice</strong>: And the word was made flesh.</p>
<p><strong>beggars’ voices</strong>: And dwelt among us. Hail Mary full
of grace …</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.</p>
<p><strong>beggars</strong>: That we may be made worthy of the promises
of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are they going to work here too?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Don’t worry. Nobody’s going to disturb
you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Don’t forget the meeting with the lawyer. The
car will pick you up tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I’ll be ready.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Do you intend to stay here for some time?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Yes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You can come and live again in the big house
if you want. Now that I’m alone, I can settle down anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: And …your friend?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: She’s left.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Is she coming back?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Why does any man leave a woman?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: If you don’t understand, I don’t want to
explain it to you. You’re too cold and religious; you’d be shocked.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You have decided to leave, Moncho.</p>
<p><strong>moncho</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: I can’t do anything to make you stay?
These people annoy you, isn’t that it?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Well, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: He’s coming to live with me, miss.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: If that’s what you want … But I’m very
sorry you’re leaving. Thank you for everything, Moncho. God bless
you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge’s voice</strong>: Obviously! Here’s the missing
furniture! What a state it’s in! Father must have been a peculiar
type.</p>
<p><strong>ramona’s voice</strong>: I don’t think the master ever came
here.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: And this chest?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: There are some curtains and drapes, but
they’re all very old.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: There must be some rat’s nest in there! I’d
like to ask you something. You worked for my father for seven years,
didn’t you? Did he ever mention me?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I don’t know; I can’t remember. But I’m sure
he loved you.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: You wouldn’t be here otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: These chairs are in good condition. With a
little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite
presentable.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What are these sacks doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: I don’t know – they’ve always been
there.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: That’s stupid! Plaster! It can still be
used.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: And those! That’s sand. As I won’t be here
tomorrow, tell the foreman to take them.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: What’s wrong with you, woman? Why are you
looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Do you know something, Ramona? If you took
some trouble, you’d be quite pretty … Small teeth, a good mouth – what
more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Let’s sit down a moment.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Are we leaving?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Don Jorge said he’d be waiting for you at
the lawyer’s at four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: You’re the most responsible here. I’m
handing them over to you. Make sure they all behave themselves.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: They’re going to hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Well if they hurt you, put up with it! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>beggars’ voices</strong>: Good luck, miss!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Keep quiet. These miserable brats only
get in the way.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: You’d like me to kill them?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: With the life that’s ahead of them they’d be
better off being sent to Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Put her in the sun with her sister.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Now to knock off a couple of lambs. We’ll
have them roasted.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: What do you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: I’ll go along with it … if it’s being
respectful enough.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: What will the lady say?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: She won’t even know.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: If everybody agrees, but to make a roast
takes four hours.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Well, what’s all the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Didn’t you say you know how to make
vanilla pudding?</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: You hear that, Poca? Get the eggs and milk.
I’ll see to the lambs.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Don’t kill yourself, Refugio! Can’t you see
we’re alone?</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: What’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: What’s the good of working?</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: You keep quiet. The miss left me in
charge here and nobody is going to upset things. You, stick to your
singing!</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Look at us now! What made you think that I
was up to something?</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Don Zequiel! Refugio! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Damn women! How did you get in
there?</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: Through a back window.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Come here, Don Zequiel. I was here with the
lady. There’re wonderful things inside!</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: If it’s only to have a look …</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: But don’t touch anything. Leave
everything where it is!</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Little dove from the south, you’re hurt. What
are you called? My little dove! My dear dove! My darling, sweet
dove!</p>
<p><strong>first worker</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>second worker</strong>: Come any nearer and I’ll bust your
head in!</p>
<p><strong>third worker</strong>: Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: You bastards! I hope you get what I’ve
got!</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: That woman, the one who looks like our Miss
Viridiana, she’s the wife of the man who hanged himself.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Think of hanging yourself, with all
that money!</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: He must have had asthma. All those loaded
old men have asthma.</p>
<p><strong>dwarf</strong>: What stuff!</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Look at that. How’s that for a
tablecloth!</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Come on, let’s put it out.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: That must have cost a fortune. At least a
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: A thousand! More like ten thousand! Can’t
you see it’s French lace?</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Go on, fold it up, you’re going to
spoil it.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Keep on smoking and shut up. We’re not doing
any harm. It’s not as bad as smoking his tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Don Zequiel’s right. If those people come
back and we don’t hear them, God help you.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: They won’t get back before tomorrow. I
heard them tell the driver.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: If you haven’t eaten on lace like that, you
haven’t lived.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Don’t worry! We’ll all clean it up; it’ll
be as right as rain.</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: Pass me that bottle.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Go on, Don Amalio!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: They’ve got a real hen house here! You
can’t hear yourself speak.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays
eggs in a barn?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Shut up, let’s hear Don Amalio!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Quiet! Now we’re gathered together to
beg under the porches. But only in the churches of the rich! The girls
passing by smelled so sweet that you felt them on you.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: That’s great! You can smell them but you can’t
lay your hands on them! Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Why did you split up?</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: You, shut your face! I won’t have
questions from any one!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Okay, it broke up when this deaf fellow
started on the collection boxes in the churches with a knife.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: The noise of the money in his pocket
gave him away. We hardly got a sou that day.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: You know what I did? I told the police
about him!</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: You sang because he didn’t cut you in, you
rat!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: The judges thanked me very much, and one
of them, who was a gentleman, said I was …</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Shitty bastard, that’s what I’d call
you!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: He said “Honest citizen,” if you want to
know.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: You filthy little brat. Shut up or watch
out!</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: What’s up with you? Why are you screaming?
I’ll belt you one!</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Don’t you touch my little girl.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Keep the brat quiet so we can hear what’s
going on.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: I’ll bust your face.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Keep your hands off me, you filthy
whore!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Stop this, stop this.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Let me go, Don Amalio, I’ll tear her
apart.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Keep quiet, Enedina, she’s not worth
paying attention to. Let’s behave ourselves nicely. Stick to your
place.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Enedina?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Is it all right?</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Enedina’s going to take a picture. So we’ll
have a souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Where’s the camera?</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: It’s a present from my parents.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: The lousy man. Tables aren’t meant to lie
on.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Eat your pudding. It’s a dream.</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: You’re a dainty piece. How spry you
are, Enedina.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: This isn’t Enedina.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Little dove of the south. Little dove.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Enedina, come here. Sit down. Come on,
drink up!</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: There, there, don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: Look at this, Enedina.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: Get down, you won’t see it otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: Just look at this, Don Zequiel! Isn’t it
awful!</p>
<p><strong>enedina’s voice</strong>: Get off, let me go! Let me go! Let
me go!</p>
<p><strong>don zequiel</strong>: Leave them alone! It’ll make them
sorrier later!</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Don Amalio!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Enedina and Paco …</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: They’re playing games behind the couch …</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Which couch?</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Take me there.</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Really, Don AMALIO, there’s not much point in
making a fuss.</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Where are you, you swine? I’ll crack
your skull in. Take me to them and I’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>refugio</strong>: Things are going to be worse than the Cuban
War …</p>
<p><strong>gardener</strong>: You’re right. We’ll be better off if we’re
seen in the village tonight.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Now he has spoiled the party.</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: If he were my man, he’d have his rights;
but as it is, why?</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: You’re quite right, old dear. The way he
treats you …</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: Now it’s every man for himself. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>paco</strong>: Good night … He doesn’t feel too well.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Good night, Don Jorge. We’re leaving
now…</p>
<p><strong>enedina</strong>: They told us you’d be back tomorrow …</p>
<p><strong>poca</strong>: I didn’t want to do it, Don Jorge. They made
me …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Get out of here! Out!</p>
<p><strong>don amalio</strong>: Blessed are the generous, master, who
take into their respectable house a poor defenseless blind man. God will
reward them.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Didn’t you hear me? Beat it.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Okay, get out, you.</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Your Lordship must not get annoyed: I have
not done anything wrong . ..</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: I got him, comrade. I got him!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: My God, what have you done to him!</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: He was asking for it.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: But why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Jorge! Jorge!</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: You shouldn’t cry over that. If you’re
without one man you can always find another to console you.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Jos�, Jos�! For the love of God, don’t
let him…</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Nothing will happen to you, miss. We’re all
good folk here. Aren’t we, Hobbly?</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: To the village! We’ve got to warn …</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: They’ll get them in no time. If they’ve
stolen anything, it won’t do them any good.</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Ramona! Help!</p>
<p><strong>viridiana</strong>: Ramona! Ramona!</p>
<p><strong>hobbly</strong>: Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I’ll …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Come here!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Come here, you rogue! Come here!</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Maybe afterwards he’ll let me …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: If you free me, you’ll be a rich man …</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Me, rich? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: There’s plenty of money in this house. Piles
of it.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I don’t want you to untie me. Kill him and
then I’ll give you the money.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Where’s the dough?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Kill him and I’ll tell you. If I don’t keep
my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him,
idiot!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: That will teach you not to bother me any
more, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>leper</strong>: Where’s the cash?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: There in the cupboard. It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: On the top shelf under the linen.</p>
<p><strong>ramona</strong>: Up there.</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I want a switch here; and put a plug over
there.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Have you got over the scare you had
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You can put the other plug there at the
bottom for the two floor lamps that I’ve bought.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: The towel.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Where are you going? Wait!</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Come in, Viridiana. Has something
happened?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Did you want to speak to me? Is there
anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I must say, I was not expecting you. We are
playing cards …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: I hope you are not surprised by this pastime,
but the evenings are long and they must be got through, somehow. But …
do sit down …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Don’t leave, Ramona. Come here! Mademoiselle
is not proud and she doesn’t mind your staying here. Isn’t that so?</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You know how to play cards, cousin? No? Then
sit down. I’m sure you’ll like it.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You too, sit down. Come on, sit down. All
cats are gray at night…</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Do you like this music, Viridiana? It’s
popular now.</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: Cut. Like that …</p>
<p><strong>jorge</strong>: You won’t believe me, but the first time I
met you I said to myself: “My cousin Viridiana will end up playing cards
with me.”</p>
