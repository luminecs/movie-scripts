<p><strong>interview with the vampire</strong>: Adapted by Neil Jordan
From the novel by Anne Rice</p>
<p><strong>int. room. night</strong>: A small bare room, illuminated
only by the streetlight coming through the window.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So you want me to tell you the story of my
life…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s what I do. I interview people. I
collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a
cop who -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’d have to have a lot of tape for my
story. I’ve had a very unusual life.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: So much the better. I’ve got a pocket full
of tapes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You followed me here, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Saw you in the street outside. You seemed
interesting. Is this where you live?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s just a room…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: So shall we begin? What do yo do?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: See? I knew you were interesting. You mean
this literally, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I
was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Well, what a lucky break for me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Perhaps lucky for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ll tell you my story. All of it. I’d like
to do that very much.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You were going to kill me? Drink my
blood?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes but you needn’t worry about that now.
Things change.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You believe this, don’t you? That you’re a
vampire? You really think…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We can’t begin this way. Let me turn on the
light.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: But I thought vampires didn’t like the
light.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.</p>
<p><strong>louis’ face</strong>: appears inhumanly white, eyes
glittering. Inhuman or not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and
ghastly.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t be frightened. I want this
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The same way you do it. A series of simple
gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I’m flesh and blood, you
see. But not human. I haven’t been human for two hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we
begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin
when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That’s really where we should
start, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You’re not lying to me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it
happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But times were different then. I was a man at
that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New
Orleans…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I had just lost my wife in childbirth. She
and the infant had been buried less than half a year.</p>
<p><strong>dianne de pointe du lac 1763 - 1791</strong>: INFANT JEAN
MARIE - 1791</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I was twenty-four and life seemed finished. I
couldn’t bear the pain of thier loss. I longed for a release from
it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I wanted to lose everything. My wealth, my
estate, my sanity. But Lady Luck didn’t oblige.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’re calling me a cheat?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then do me a favour. Get rid of this piece of
shit…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You lack the courage of your convictions,
sir. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Most of all I longed for death. I know that
now. I invited it, a release from the pain of living…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors,
thieves, whores and slaves…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But it was a vampire that accepted.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: They would have killed you -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then my luck would have changed.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You want death? Is it death you want?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You still want death? Or have you tasted it
enough?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Enough…</p>
<p><strong>on malloy’s face</strong>: captivated, terrified,
enthralled.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: That’s how it happened?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No. The Gift of Darkness requires more than
that, as you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He left me half dead that morning. he wanted
something from me. He came back the following night.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Who the hell are you? What are you doing in
my house?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a
good life, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’re not afraid of anything, are you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why should I be?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Are you going to put that through me too?
Ruin my beautiful clothes?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Were all last night’s promises for
nothing?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I’ve come to answer your prayers. You want
to die, don’t you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The wine has no taste. The food sickens you.
There seems no reason for any of it, does there? But what if I could
give it back to you? Pluck out the pain and give you another life? And
it would be for all time? And sickeness and death could never touch you
again?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Vampires, that’s what we are. Creatures of
darkness, only we see it that darkness more clearly than any mortal has
ever seen…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Wouldn’t it be sweet to bid pain goodbye? To
wave away anguish and grief? To embrace the peace of the unending
night?</p>
<p><strong>marble child</strong>: Papa…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Diane!!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death
which you can now destroy…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: NO!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You have to ask me for this. You have to
want it, do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Give it to me!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Vampires. We thrive on blood.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I want it!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Tomorrow night. You must prove yourself. I
will give you the choice I never had.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The sun’s coming up. Watch it carefully. If
you come with me tomorrow, you’ll never see it again.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My last sunrise. That morning I was not yet a
vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, yet I
don’t remember any sunrise before it. I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time, as if it were the first. And the I said
goodbye to sunlight and went out to become what I became.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Your grief has unhinged you. You’ve let your
estate rot.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You let your overseer run riot, work your
slaves to the bone. We’ll start with him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How do you mean, start?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Call him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Carlos!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Why the bloody whip, Carlos?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Let’s call that a start.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ve just done it -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Kill me if you will, but I can’t do this…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Don’t worry. He was white trash, they come
at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked
his wounds clean.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You’re the devil, aren’t you? That’s who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I wish I were. But if I were, what would I
want with you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t go through with it, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Your perfect. Your bitter and you’re
strong.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But why do you want me?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Because you’re as strong as I was when I was
alive.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You really want to be with them?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You asked for death. I didn’t promise it
-</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: It’s not your wife and child my friend. It’s
death. Just that simple. Think and choose. It happens to everyone.
Except us.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: We shall be this way always, my friend.
Young as we are now. I’m lonely for a companion, lonely for your
strength. But I’m not that lonely. Do you want to come or not?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Did I hear a yes?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>louis pov –</strong>: The moon, through hanging vines. The
marble statue of his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the child’s fingers
reach out…</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Lestat lets Louis fall down beside
the broken crypt. Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I’ve drained you to the point of death. If
you drink from me you live for ever. If I leave you here you die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No. Don’t leave me here. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Stop staring at my buttons. Didn’t I tell
you it was going to be fun?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’re body’s dying. Pay no attention. It
will take twenty minutes at most.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Dying?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: It happens to us all.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Come, you’re going to feed now.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I want a woman.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: That doesn’t matter anymore, Louis. You’ll
see. Come…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: They’re all beautiful now. Men, women, the
old, the young…simply because they are alive. -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Take him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The crucifix -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Forget the crucifix. Take him.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Resist no more Louis. Feed…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You have fed. You were made for this…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Dear God, what have I done?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ve killed Louis. And enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Dear God, what have I become????</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You said the slave had a crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh, that rumour about crosses?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You can’t look at them…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I
like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: The story about stakes through the
heart?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The same. As you would say today… Bull
shit.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: What about coffins?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Coffins… coffins unfortunately are a
necessity…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Killing is no ordinary act. It is the
experience of another’s life for certain. That night I had lost my own
life and taken another’s. I was drowning in a sea of human guilt and
regret, with all the heightened senses of a vampire…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes, that’s you, my handsome friend. And
you’ll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It can’t be…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Give it time. You’re like a man who loses a
limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep
now. I can feel the sun approaching.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You must get into it. It’s the only safe
place for you when the light comes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And if I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The sun will destroy the blood I’ve given
you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that
too.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Don’t be afraid. In moments you’ll be
sleeping as soundly as you ever slept. And when you awake I’ll be
waiting for you, and so will all the world.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You told me something earlier. You said you
didn’t have a choice. Was that true?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Someday I’ll tell you. We have a lot of time
to talk to each other. You might say… we have all the time we shall ever
need.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Dear God, what have I done?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I awoke the next evening to a different
world. And I realized there are as profound differences between vampires
as between human beings…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Your wealth, dear Louis, is inestimable.
Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I sat there staring at him with contempt. He
had the soul of a shopkeeper, he was the sow’s ear out of which nothing
fine could be made. I felt sadly cheated in having him as a teacher…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ll get used to killing. Just forget
about that mortal coil. You’ll become accustomed to things all too
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>yvette</strong>: You are not hungry, sir…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Au contraire, my dear. He could eat a
horse…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I looked at anything mortal and saw all life
as precious, condemning all fruitless guilt and passion that would let
it slip through the fingers like sand…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was only as a vampire that I could see
Yvette’s beauty. Her fear of me increased my desire.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave us.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Can’t you pretend, you fool? Don’t give the
game away. We’re lucky to have such a home.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Pretend to drink, at least.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Such fine crystal shouldn’t go to waste…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I know. It gets cold so fast.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We can live like this? Off the blood of
animals?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I wouldn’t call it living. I’d call it
surviving. A useful trick if you’re caught for a month on a ship at
sea.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: There’s nothing in the world now that
doesn’t hold some…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Fascination…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes. And I’m bored with this prattle –</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But we can live without taking human life.
It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Anything is possible. But just try it for a
week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This was New Orleans, a magical and
magnificent place to live. In which a vampire, richly dressed might
attract no more notice in the evening than hundreds of other exotic
creatures.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Come on, mon cher. The best in the colony.
Once you touch this you’ll never go to any other tavern again.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You think so, cherie? But what if I’d rather
taste your lips?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: My lips are even sweeter still…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Have you ever been caught?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Of course not. It’s so easy you almost feel
sorry for them.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat killed two, sometimes three a night. A
fresh young girl, that was his favourite for the first of the
evening.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But the triumphant kill of Lestat was a young
man. They represented the greatest loss to Lestat because they stood on
the threshold of the maximum possibility of life.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The trick is not to think about it. See that
one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her
husband. She’s perfect for you. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But how do you know?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Read her thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The dark gift is different for each of us.
But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Take my word for it. She blamed a slave for
his murder. And do you know what they did to him?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: The evildoers are easier. And they taste
better…</p>
<p><strong>widow st. clair</strong>: Now, young man, you really amaze
me! I’m old enough to be your grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>widow st. clair</strong>: Yes, that’s the melody, I remember
it. Oh yes…</p>
<p><strong>widow st clair</strong>: Murder!!! Murderer!!</p>
<p><strong>widow st clair</strong>: My little papillions! My
butterflies!!! He killed them!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You whining coward of a vampire who prowls
the night killing rats and poodles. You could have finished us both!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What have you done to me? You’ve condemned me
to hell.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I don’t know any hell -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You want to see me kill? Watch me kill you
then -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What strength, my friend, what strength. I
remember why I chose you now.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: But you can’t kill me, Louis. Nor I you.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Feed on what you want, mon cherie. Rats,
chickens, doves, goats. I’ll leave you to it and watch you come round.
Just remember, life without me would be even more unbearable…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Being a vampire to him meant revenge. Revenge
against life-itself. Every time he took a life it was revenge. and the
slaves with a wisdom that was denied their masters, began to notice…</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yes… please…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire
has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of
fangs.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Paris? You came from Paris?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: As did the one who made me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Tell me about him. You must have lernt
something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn’t give a
choice, remember?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But you must know something about the meaning
of it all, you must know where we come from, why we…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Why? Why should I know these things? Do you
know them?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They know about us. They see us dine on empty
plates and drink from empty glasses.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Come the New Orleans then. There’s an opera
on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I respect life, don’t you see? For each and
every human life I have respect.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Respect me a little then. I’m the only life
you know.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ll soon run out of chickens, Louis…</p>
<p><strong>yvette</strong>: Michi Louis? You don’t want any supper?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is all well at
Pointe Du Lac tonight?</p>
<p><strong>yvette</strong>: We worry about you master. When do you ride
about the fields? How long since you’ve been to the slave quarters?
Everywhere there is death. Animals, men. Are you our master still at
all?</p>
<p><strong>yvette</strong>: I will not go unless you listen to me. Send
away this new friend of yours. The slaves are frightenend of him. They
are frightenend of you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I am frightened of myself, Yvette.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hush, Yvette -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This place is cursed. Damned, do you hear me?
And your master is the devil.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Get out while you can. You’re free men.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Unlike me, you are no free men…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Do I have to convince you?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You fool, what have you done?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What you wouldn’t do. It’s almost sunrise. It
will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the
fire!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Where do you think, my idiot friend? We’re
in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and
proper enough?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We belong in hell.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: And what if there is no hell, or they don’t
want us there? Ever think of that?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You loved Yvette…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Can a vampire feel love?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You loved your wife, surely.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I was human then. Might as well ask can an
angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain… detachment.
Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never
know.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved Pointe Du
Lac. And as with each thing I loved, I destoryed it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat I did not love. And he survived.</p>
<p><strong>whore 1</strong>: You’re skin’s icy.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Not always…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Your friend has no head for wine.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: She’s stupid. I can warm that cold skin of
yours better than she can.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: Why you’re warm now.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Ah, but the price is pretty high. Your sweet
friend - I exhausted her.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m leaving you. I can’t stand this any
longer.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What, no flowery speeches? About what a
monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m not interested in you. You disgust me.
I’m interested in my own nature and know I can’t trust you to tell me
the truth about me.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What do you imagine you are Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I don’t pretend to know.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Don’t you understand, Louis, that you alone
of all creatures can see death with impunity… you alone under the rising
moon can strike like the hand of God.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat, she’s alive!!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Vampires are killers. Predators, who’s all
seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The girl, Lestat -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I know. Let her alone.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You think you can be human. You think you
can go back. But you can’t. You live off the blood of rats now Louis.
How human is that?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Lie still, love…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’re tired love, you want to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why do you do this Lestat?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you
aesthete’s taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do
it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s a coffin, a coffin! Get me out!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Of course it’s a coffin. You’re dead,
love.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat - finish this -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You finish her - if you feel so much -</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You won’t let me die, will you? You’ll save
me?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: But it’s too late, love. Look at your wrist,
you breast.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Unless I make her one of us…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: NO!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My God… to think you… are all I have to learn
from…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: In the old world, they called it the dark
gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Am I damned? Am I from the devil? Is my very
nature that of a devil? And all the while, as these dreaded questions
caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were
threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t go that way Monsieur. It’s the plague. Go
back the way you came.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The way I came…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: …and finally, when I could stand it no
longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a
child crying.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Mama, please wake up. Mama, I’m frightened,
please wake up.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Monsieur, please help us. Papa’s waiting
for us at the ship. Please wake mama, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And if I am damned, why do I fell such pity
for her gaunt face? Why do I wish to warm her tiny arms? Comfort her
beating heart?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Ah, my philospher, my martyr. “Never take a
human life”. Well you must admit it is funny. Or is it merely touching?
I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Let’s make some party of it, shall we? Maybe
there’s some life in the old lady yet?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Come back, Louis, you are what you are. The
plague would have got her within hours anyway. Merciful Death how you
love your precious guilt.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: For years I had not savoured a human. And
when I had Lestat’s words made sense to me. I knew peace only when I
killed and when I heard her heart in that terrible rhythm I knew again
what peace could be. Yet even then I could not contenance it…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: All I need to find you Louis is follow the
corpses of rats.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like
no other creature because you are a vampire. You don’t want it to go
on.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Do what it is in your nature to do. And you
will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to
the craving.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: That and more.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Evil is a point of view. God kills,
indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we
are, none so like him as ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Ah, but we have even more in common with our
creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: She’s here, your wounded one.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You need company, Louis. More congenial than
mine…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You remember how you wanted her, the taste
of her -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I didn’t want to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Don’t worry, Louis, you’re conscience is
clear. You left her alive.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You’re ill,
my precious and I’m going to give you what you need to get well.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: That’s it dear. More. You must drink it to
get well.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Stop, that’s enough. No more.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I want more.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What have you done?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: More.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And
I’ll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from
me? Never again.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Ah, quelle Belle enfant!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Gently, cherie. They are so innocent. They
must not be made to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You are the devil! You are the instrument of
Satan!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: That’s enough, cherie. Stop before the heart
stops.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I want some more.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: It’s bet in the beginning, lest the death
takes you down with it. yes, that’s it. My child. My beloved child.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Where is Mamma?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Mamma’s gone to Heaven, cherie, like that
sweet lady over there. They all go to Heaven. And you did very well,
cherie. Not a drop spilt. Very good! You’re going to be our child
now.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Your mama’s left you with us. She wants you
to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You are the devil! You are the instrument of
Satan!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m not your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and
Louis’ daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go
away. But now he’s not. He’s going to stay and make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Lou…eee…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You fiend. You monster.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: One happy family.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: A child vampire!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Shall we go on?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: He did it to make you stay with him!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her
more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps
in the end he did it – to show me that he could. For he lavished
affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different
with madame Claudia, as you can imagine…</p>
<p><strong>dressmaker</strong>: Monsuier, I need more light. I shall go
slind if you do not bring me a lamp, or let me fit this child during the
day. Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Let me kiss it better…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A little child she was, but also a fierce
killer, now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child’s
demanding.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who
will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her
child’s fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Mute and beautiful, she played with dolls,
dressing them and undressing them by the hour.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Mute and beautiful, she killed. And to watch
her kill was chilling.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Why are you crying, child?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Are you lost, my love?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Mama…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hush now, don’t cry, We’ll find her…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Mama…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They found death fast in those days, before
she lernt to play with the, to delay the moment till she had taken what
she wanted…</p>
<p><strong>piano-teacher</strong>: The thumb girl! Mind the thumb!</p>
<p><strong>dollmaker</strong>: They are expensive, my dear. Maybe too
expensive for a young girl like you…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She grew, yet stayed the same. She wanted a
bed of her own, yet would climb back into mine.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Claudia, Claudia! Didn’t I tell you, never
in the house!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: September 21st, one hour after sunset. The
sky is still violet, the way Louis loves and as always Lestat was gone
when we rose.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How did you learn to write, Claudia?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: The way I learn everything. By watching
you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But you never let me see you kill,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat taught you all you need to know about
that.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter
death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He jests.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why does he call you that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hush, Claudia don’t talk about such things.
Show me your book.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia! You did that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sit still. It’s not finished -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Time can pass fast for mortals when they’re
happy. With us it was the same.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was a very different life. And a new
century was beginning. what had once been a small godforsaken French
colony was growing into a great port, giving us an endless train of
magnificent strangers…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: All human life was here, for the taking. And
we took, all three of us, in our different ways…</p>
<p><strong>youth</strong>: You want to come inside, lovely?</p>
<p><strong>youth</strong>: Ever been kissed?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: She’s like me, Louis. Small and yet not
small at all. Like me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I watched her grow yet stay the same, her
doll-like face possessed of adult eyes, eery, powerful, seductive…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Another doll? I have ten, you realise.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Well, I thought you could use another.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why always on this night?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What night? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You always give me the doll on the same
night of the year.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I didn’t realise.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is this my birthday?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Some of these are so old and tattered. You
should throw them away.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I have. Or there would be twice as
many.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: But you’re the fairest by far.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You dress me like a doll. You make my hair
like a doll. Why?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You want me to be a doll forever?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia - don’t -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Can’t I change, like everybody else?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Which of you did it? Which of you made me
the way I am?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What you are? You would be something other
than you are?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And if I cut my hair again?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: It will grow back again!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But it wasn’t always so! I had a mother
once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so
was I!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You made us what we are, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Stop her Louis!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: DID YOU DO IT TO ME????</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why yours alone? Tell me how it was
done!!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Be glad I made you what you are! You’d be
dead not if I hadn’t.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We’re immortal. You’ve always known that.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Tell me why…you’ve got to tell me…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You see the old woman? That will never happen
to you. You’ll never grow old. You will never die.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And it means something else too, doesn’t
it? I shall never, ever grow up.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I hate him. But I cannot bear to lose you.
You’re the only companion I have, forever. You taught me everything I
know. Please tell me Louis. Tell me how it came to be that I am this…
thing…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come… I’ve something to show you…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Though everything was changed, through the
years had warped the contours of the streets, I found my way there,
aware that I’d always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to
pass the doorway where I’d first heard Claudia cry.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I heard you crying. You were there in a room
with your mother. You were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as
you had been for days. Because your mother was dead…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I opened the shutters… I came into the room…
I felt pity for you. Pity, but something else.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You… fed on me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at
what I’d done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to
stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night
hereafter.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You both did it?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I took your life. He gave you another
one.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And here it is. And I hate you both.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: But why did you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How could I not? She had to know.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: And did you lose her? Did she go?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Where would she have gone? She was a child,
and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her
that…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I walked all night. I walked as I walked
years before when my mind swam with guilt at the thought of killing. I
found myself at the Cathedral.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I thought of all the things I had done and
couldn’t undo. And I longed for one second’s peace…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I had no fear. If anything I longed for
something to happen, for the stones to tremble as I entered the
foyer.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I almost genuflected from old habit. I almost
prayed.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And then it struck me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What if the statues gave an image to nothing?
What if I was the supernatural in this cathedral? The only immortal
under this roof. And I felt nothing but loneliness. Loneliness to the
point of madness.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You wish to go to confession? I was about to
lock up the church.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You are troubled, aren’t you? Can I
help?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s too late, too late -</p>
<p><strong>preist</strong>: No, it’s never too late. Come…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Bless me father for I have sinned so often
and so long, I don’t know how to change nor beg for forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Son, God is infinite in his capacity to
forgive. Tell him from your heart.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Murders, father, death after death. The woman
who died two nights ago in Jackson Square, I killed her. And thousands
of others before her. I have walked the streets of New Orleans like the
Grim reaper. And fed on human life for my own. I am a vampire, father,
and have turned the one I love most of all into on too –</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Do you know the meaning of sacrilege?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then there is no mercy.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You talk of sacrilege. Why if God exists does
he suffer me to exist?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Why does he suffer me to live?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Locked together in hatred –</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But I can’t hate you Louis.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is this the aroma of a mortal child?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis. Lover.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I was mortal to you. You gave me your
immortal kiss. You became my mother and my father. And so I’m yours.
Forever.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But now’s the time to end it, Louis. Now’s
the time to leave him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’ll never let us go.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh… really?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So we made plans. She was convinced there
were others of our kind in Europe, that they would have the answers
Lestat couldn’t provide. Lestat whom she now hated, who she thought she
could be free of. I doubted, but then she had a suprise in store…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What is it now? You irritate me! Your very
presence irritates me!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Does it?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes. And I’ll tell you something else! I’ve
met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is that supposed to frighten me?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’re spoilt because you’re an only child.
You need a brother. Or I do. I’m weary of you both.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I suppose we could people the world with
vampires, the three of us.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Not you my dear.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You’re a liar. But you upset my plans.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: What plans?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I came to make peace with you, even if
you’re the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Stop pestering me then!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I’ve
brought a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Then I hope its a beautiful woman with
endowments you will never possess.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Better than that.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You haven’t fed enough. I can tell by your
colour.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Oh, Claudia, you’ve outdone yourself. Where
did you find them?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I
thought of you when I saw them.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: We forgive each other then?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No. Laudanum.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Laudanum!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it
keeps the blood warm.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them… and let me
drink…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Don’t Louis –</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Louis, put me in my coffin…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’ll put you in your coffin. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia! Don’t do this thing!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift — help me
—</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What have you done, Claudia -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis! Look what’s happening to him!!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Don’t mock me, Louis. Help me.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Goodnight, sweet prince, may flights of
devils wing you to your rest.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He’s dead, Claudia, dead.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: The one good lesson he taught me, Louis.
Never drink from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Help me. We must get rid of him.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he
have liked, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t mock, Claudia…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: The swamp…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own
kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And suppose the one who made him knows
nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back,
nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must
live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And if we find the one who made him? Do we
tell him we destroyed his own creation? The vampire Lestat?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He
deserved to die.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then maybe so do we. Every night of our
lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it
is.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I did it for us, Louis. So we could be
free.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis, look at me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I can’t. Go away from me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia - You’re crying -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You never talked to me like that - in all
these years.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And you never cried -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I can’t bear it when you do - I would die
rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Tell me you don’t hate me Louis. I did it
for you -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I love you Claudia. Always. And we are free
now, Claudia. No Lestat. Just the two of us, beginning the great
adventure of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The birds. We forgot about the birds. There’s
nothing for it but to let them go.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The workmen must have a trunk - don’t stop,
cherie -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis!!!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Don’t Louis -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT ACCURSED
CHILD?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It can’t be -</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It is! Take the back stairwell -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Stay back— for the love of God… or I’ll burn
you alive…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: The ship is sailing wihout us!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Though the fire seemed to spread through the
quartier, I stood on that deck until dawn, fearful he would come out
again of the very river like some monster to destroy us both. And all
the while I thought, Lestat, we deserve your vengeance. You gave me the
dark gift. And I delivered you into the hands of death for the second
time.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Did he die in the fire?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He was dead to us. We were free. That was all
that mattered.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Though the ship was blessedly free of rats, a
strange plague nonetheless struck its passengers.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia and I alone seemed imune. We kept to
ourselves, pondering the mystery of Lestat and the greater mystery of
each other.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We reached the Mediterranean. I wanted those
waters to be blue. They were black, nightime waters and how I suffered
then, straining to remember the colour that a young man’s senses had
taken for granted, that my memory had let slip away for eternity. It was
balck off the coast of Italy, black off the coast of Greece, Europe
itself was black.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis, your quest is for darkness only.
This sea is not your sea. They myths of men are not your myths. Their
history isn’t yours.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We saw the Acropolis by moonlight, shades of
grey and silver. And I longed for the brilliant white of those marbles
in the hot sun of Homer…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We docked at Varna and searched the rural
countryside of the Carpathians, for what she liked to term “our
kind”…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The quest for these Old World vampires filled
me with bitterness. We searched village after village, ruin after ruin
and I was glad when always we found nothing. For what could the damned
really have to say to the damned?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You found nothing?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic,
crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit.
But one of our kind? Not a whisper.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No vampires in Transylvania? No Count
Dracula?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a
demented Irishman… So we repaired to Paris…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I think the very name of Paris brought a rush
of pleasure to me that was extraordinary. I was a Creole, after all and
Paris was the mother of New Orleans, a universe whole and entire unto
herself…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We were alive again. We were in love and so
euphoric was I that I yielded to her every desire…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Help me, mon chere…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Still my beautiful child.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: A beautiful child! Is that what you still
think I am?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why do you turn away? Why don’t you
look.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You want me to be your daughter forever,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well tell me, papa. What was it like making
love?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You don’t remember? Or you never knew.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It was something hurries…and seldom savoured…
something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of
killing.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But how will I ever know, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’ll never find them, will I? My own
kind…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Have I anything in common with her,
Louis?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Or her, or her - or any of them?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia, you torture yourself.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: They are ducklings, that will grow into
swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You are more beautiful than any of them.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: All her dolls resemble me.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change
either.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this –</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her
dolls? make a doll of her in turn?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Come, Claudia…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: For a time we had been almost human, in the
sensual whirl of whtt Paris had to offer. But the human delights of that
city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become. I
felt her pain as I walked until I become aware that I was being
followed.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So it was when I had given up the search for
vampires that a vampire found me…</p>
<p><strong>louis and statiago</strong>: Clever.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You mean me harm?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You mean me harm?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Trickster. Buffoon!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ve searched the world for an immortal and
this is what I find?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: You are all right.</p>
<p><strong>theatre des vampires</strong>: By Special Invitation Friday,
9 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Bring the petit beauty with you. No one will
harm you. I won’t allow it. Remember my name. Armand.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Remember what I’ve told you. They’ll have
different powers. They’ll read your thoughts if you allow it.</p>
<p><strong>theatre des vampires presents</strong>: THE MASQUE OF THE RED
DEATH By Edgar Allen Poe</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But this can’t be real. This is
nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Nonsense all right. But something tell me
it’s going to be the strangest nonsense we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of
drops to drink.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They are here. I know they are. Listen for
something that doesn’t make a sound.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s a vampire. It’s the one I saw in Rue St
Jacques.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They use no paint. And the audience think it
is paint.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How devilishly clever.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: She’s no vampire.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No. She’s frightened. She doesn’t know where
she is.</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: I don’t want to die!</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: We are death!</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: Someone help me. Please… What have I
done?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This is no performance.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And no one knows but us…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: We all die. Death is the one thing you
share with all those here.</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: But I’m young…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Death is no respecter of age. He can come
any time, any place. Need I tell you what fate has in store for you?</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: I would take my chance. Let me go!
Please…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: And if you take that chance and live, what
is your fate? The humpbacked toothless visage of old age?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: This is monstrous!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes, and very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Just as this flesh is pink now, it will
turn grey and wrinkle with age.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Let me live, please. I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Then why should you care if you die
now?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: And suppose death had a heart to love and
to release you? To whom would he turn his passion? Would you pick a
person from the crowd there? A person to suffer as you suffer?</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Oh, yes, take me Monsier Vampire! I
adore you!</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You wait your turn.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Well, have you a sister, a mother, a
daughter you would send in your place?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: We alone can give death meaning. Do you
know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: No pain.</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: No pain?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Your beauty is a gift to us.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Who deserves such a gift?</p>
<p><strong>mortal woman</strong>: No pain…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’ve seen enough of this! I loathe it!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Be still!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Patience, Louis. Patience.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We’ve been searching for you for a very long
time…</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Such a darling.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Monstrous.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Yes, and very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Your lips, they didn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: They did, but too fast for you to see them.
No magic, just grace and speed.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: He wants you…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Disappointing, isn’t it? To come so far and
find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make-
believe…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We had feared we were the only ones…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: But how did you come into existence?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: You don’t want to answer… Two vampires from
the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly
rots and fades away.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Are you the leader of tis group?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: If there were a leader, I would be the
one.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So you have the answers…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Ah! You have questions?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What are we?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Nothing if not vampires…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Who made us what we are?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Surely you know the one who made you…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But the one who made him, who made the one
who made him, the source of all this evil…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: That is a picture, nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You mean we are not children of Satan?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your
suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die
when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But
does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call
goodness, does it not make you good?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then there is nothing.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Perhaps…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: And perhaps this is the only real evil
left…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then God does not exist…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I have not spoken to him…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And no vampire here has discourse with God or
the Devil?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: None that I’ve ever known. I know nothing of
God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that
would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred
years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My God… So it’s as I always feared. Nothing,
leading to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: You fell too much. So much you make me
feel…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: The one who made you should have told you
this. The one who left the old world for the new…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He knew nothing. He just didn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Knew? You mean he is…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Come, beloved. It’s time we were on our
way. I’m hungry and the city waits.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: So soon to go?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The place was dark as we left, a darkness
that confounded even Claudia. And as we blundered through it, again came
the thought: I have wronged Lestat, I have hated him for th wrong
reasons.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: How did you wrong him?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You read my thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You said a name -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: A name I don’t want to say again.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: I seemed to recongise it…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: There is but one crime among us vampires
here.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You should know, who are so secretive
about the vampire who made you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Boredom!</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: It is the crime that means death to any
vampire. To kill your own kind!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be born
like Venus out of the foam, as we were! Come Louis, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I lothe them! I can’t stand the sight of
them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private
club! I’ve searched for them the world over and I despise them!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What danger?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I can feel it from them! They want to know
who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic
rules!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Do you think I would let them harm you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you
to me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Love holds you to me. And we are in danger,
not you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Love?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You would leave me for Armand if he
beckoned you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: He wants you as you want him. He’s been
waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that
place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s not so.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word? When he put me in that trance…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: So you felt it too!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Let him go, he said. Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is that what I should do Louis? Let you go?
My father? My lover? My Louis, who made me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He can protect us, Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I was waiting for you…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia is dear to me. My… daughter.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Your lover.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: No, my beloved, my child.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: If you say so. You are innocent.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I’m not innocent. But I’m afraid. She feels
she’s in danger from the others.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: She is.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her
youth. It’s forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive
on its own.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then blame the one who made her…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Did you kill this vampire who made you both?
Is that why you won’t say his name? Santiago thinks you did.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We want no quarrel with him.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: It’s already begun. If you want to save her,
send her away.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Then I leave too.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: So soon? Without any of those answers you so
longed for?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You said there were none.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: But you asked the wrong questions. Do you
know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they
perish of their own will.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We can do that?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: You would never give up life. If the world
were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and
study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s what the one who made me said.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: How he must have loved you.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Louis, I need you more than he ever did. I
need a link with this century. The world changes. We do not. Therein
lies the irony that ultimately kills us. I need you to make contact with
this age.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He? Don’t you see? I’m not the spirit of any
age! I’m at odds with everything and always have been! I’m not even sure
what I am!</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: But Louis, that is the very spirit of your
age. The heart of it. You fall from grace has been the fall of a
century.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And the vampires of the Theatre?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Like moths around the candle of the age.
Decadent, useless. They can’t reflect anything. But you do. You reflect
its broken heart.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Are these not the answers you came for?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes… My God…</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: A vampire with a human soul. An immortal
with a mortal’s passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have
wept when he made you –</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Lestat! You knew Lestat!</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to
mourn his passing.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: But you must go now. You must get her safely
out of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: No-one else knows of this door. When you
knock you will find me waiting…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I feld a kind of peace at last. I had found
the teacher which Lestat could never, I knew now, have been. I knew
knowledge would never be withheld by Armand. It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass. And I knew Claudia must leave me…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Madeleine… Louis is shy.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Drink.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Do it Louis. Because I cannot do it. I
haven’t the strength. You saw to that when you made me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You haven’t the vaguest conception under God
of what you ask!</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Au contraire, monsieur, I have.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You have found your new companion, Louis!
You will make me mine!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: How do we seem to you? Do you think us
beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me!
Have you any idea of the thing you will become?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I
will suffer for it no longer!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me
from my mother’s hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn’t you
have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you
weep! You haven’t tears enough for what you’ve done to me.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You give her to me! Do this before you
leave me!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh God! I love you still, that’s the
torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And who will care for me my love, my dark
angel, when you are gone?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You promise to care for her then?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And you know what you ask for?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What do you think she is, Madeleine? A
doll?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: A child who can’t die…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And the child who did die?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: My daughter…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Look at the gaslight. Don’t tke your eyes off
it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive.
Do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Louis!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: She is dying. It happened to you too, but
your child’s mind can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But if she dies…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s only mortal death.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now
even.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What died tonight inside that room was not
that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What
has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was
human.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes father. At last. We are een.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Time for justice, little one.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn’t
countenance this -</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: You can make no demands here! Buffoon!
Bastard -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Louis…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Is he the one?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: No, the child. The child was the one…</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: All the murderers!!!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You are alive, Lestat! It can’t be murder!
Tell them how you treated us…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: No… You come back to me Louis…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Are you mad????</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: The sentence is death! To all of
them!!!</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Only the girl - it was the girl -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You promised me - I could take him back to
New Orleans - Louis - there’s something I must tell you - about that
night - that night I met you -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You let her go, Lestat - you let her free -
and I’ll come back with you -</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Death for the others. For you eternity in
a box -</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Walled in a dungeon. Your only company
will be your screams… Perhaps it will take centuries…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: He’s coming home with me - you promised
-</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: We promised nothing!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They’ve fooled you, Lestat! You must reach
Armand! Armand has the power!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Claudia!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Hurry. Don’t make a sound.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Where is she? Where’s Claudia?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Follow me - that way - through my cell -</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Not without Claudia. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I can’t save her.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You can’t believe I’d leave without her.
Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Louis, I can’t save her. I will only risk
losing you -</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ll come home with me Louis? Fro a little
while… until I am myself again.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: CLAUDIA!!!</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I couldn’t prevent it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I don’t believe you. I do not have to read
your soul to know that you lie.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Louis, they cannot be brought back. There
are some things that are impossible, even for me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You let them do it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You held sway over them. They feared you. You
wanted it to happen.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Louis, I swear I did not.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I understand you only too well. You let them
do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip
Lestat’s heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has
spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your
melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you
- you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your
cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.</p>
<p><strong>estelle</strong>: Stop him. It’s morning. The sunlight. Stop
him.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You didn’t even warm them, did you?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And yet you knew what I would o.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: I knew. I rescued you, didn’t I? From the
terrible dawn.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You were their leader. They trusted you.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: You made me see their failings, Louis. You
made me look at them with your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: Your melancholy eyes…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: What a pair we are. We deserve each other,
don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>armand</strong>: We are a pair, and that’s what counts.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: We left Paris shortly after. For years we
wandered. Greece, Egypt, all the ancient lands. Then, out of curiosity,
perhaps, boredom, who knows what, I took him home, to my America…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And there, a technological wonder allowed me
see sunrise, for the first time in two hundred years…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And what sunrises! Seen as the human eye
could never see them. We would sit in the dark, night after night among
nameless humans, entranced with the miracle of light. Silver at first,
then as the years progressed in tones of purple, red and my long-lost
blue…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And in time parted. We had become so alike,
we both wanted the certainties of loneliness once more.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I had returned to new Orleans. As soon as I
smelt the air, I knew I was home. There was sadness there, rich, almost
sweet, like the fragrance of jasmine. I walked the streets, savouring it
like a long lost perfume…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And then on Prytania Street, only blocks from
the Lafayette cemetery I caught the scent of death and it wasn’t coming
from the graves…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: The scent grew stronger as I walked. Old
death. A scent too faint for mortals to detect.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They were like the doomed princess caught in
the thorny vines of Sleeping Beauty’s castle. I knew what it meant. A
vampire had lured them here, but had benn to weak to get rid of
them.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It spelt weakness, madness, the behavior of a
dying animal that pollutes its own lair.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Lestat escaped the fire!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: He hadn’t even been there. And all those
years I thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I’m so glad you’re here Louis… I’ve dreamed
of your coming…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t try to speak… it’s alright…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I didn’t mean to let them do it… that
Santiago, he tricked me…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: That’s all past, Lestat.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Yes. Past… she should never have been one of
us…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Still beautiful Louis. You always were the
strong one.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t fear me, Lestat. I bring you no
harm.</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ve come back to me, Louis? You’ve come
again to me?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s only a siren…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I can’t bear it Louis! The machines out
there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night
brighter than the day!</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And they frighten you?</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You know I love the dark. But there’s no
dark anymore.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s false light, Lestat. It can’t harm
you…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture
out… little by little… become the old Lestat.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I have to go now Lestat…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire
Lestat…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes. I remember…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: I tried to tell you Louis… that night in
Paris… when I first came to you… no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis…
not even you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: I tried…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: And the more you tried, the more I wanted
you… a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you
suffered… I need your forgiveness, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You have it…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: You’ll come back, Louis… take me out… little
by little… and maybe I’ll be myself again…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Yes, Lestat…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: And my story ends there. But in fact it ended
a long time ago, with Claudia’s ashes in that theatre. My love died with
her. I never really changed after that. What became of Lestat I have no
idea. I go on, night after night. I feed on those who cross my path. But
all my passion went with her yellow hair. I ma a spirit with
perternatural flesh. Detached. unchangeable. Empty.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No… it can’t end like that…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: But it has. There is no more to tell.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: But you talk about passion, about longing,
about things I’ll never know in my life! It’s still inside you, in every
syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just
empty?</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: It’s over, I’m telling you…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason
to feel… what a story you’ve told, you don’t understand yourself.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Do what you want with it. Learn what you can.
Give the story to others.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You have another chance, Louis. Take me!
Give me your gift, your power…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Is this what you want? You ask me for this
after all I’ve told you?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: If I could see what you’ve seen, feel what
you’ve felt I wouldn’t let it end like this! You need a like to the
world out there, a connection… then it won’t end like this…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: You need me.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Dear God. I’ve failed again, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Don’t say anymore. The reels are still
turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I’ve
said.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: You like it? You like being food for the
immortals? You like dying? Is it beautiful? Is it intense?</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: No… please…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Louis… Louis…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>malloy</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: 1791. That’s when it happened. I was
twenty-four. Younger then you are now.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: My invitation was open to anyone. Sailors,
whores, thieves. But it was a vampire that accepted…</p>
<p><strong>lestat</strong>: Dear Louis… will I ever forget?</p>
