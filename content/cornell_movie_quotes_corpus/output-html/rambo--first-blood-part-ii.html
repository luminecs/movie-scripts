<h1 id="rambofirst-blood-part-ii">rambo–first-blood-part-ii</h1>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Nothing is over!!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: John Rambo?</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: Follow me…</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: How’ve you been, Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That’s all… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I’m sorry you were sent to such a
hellhole.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Seen worse.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You have… haven’t you…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Johnny… I told you I’d help you when I
could… you interested?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You can’t possibly want to stay in prison
for another five years?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … In here I know where I stand.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Hear me out first. A covert operation is
being geared up in the Far East. The computer dug out your name as one
of the top three able to accomplish the mission.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What mission?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Recon for P.O.W.’s in Nam.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: The prison camp you escaped from in ’71 is
the target area – no one knows that terrain better than you. The risk
factor is very high. You’ll be temporarily reinstated in the forces; and
if the operation is successful, there may be a Congressional pardon… are
you in, John?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Good. I’ll get the necessary clearances,
and the next time we’ll meet, it’ll be in Thailand with Special OP’s
designate who will honch the operation. All clear?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I want you to know I did what I could to
keep you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Sir… Do we get to win this time?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: This time it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: You can take them off.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: How ya doing, Rambo, I’m Ericson. We better
make it over to the hanger.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: So you’re the chosen one. You don’t
remember me do ya? We were in boot camp together in ’63. You went
Forces, I went Rangers… haven’t been stateside since ’72. Plenty of work
here.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: You’ve made a hell of a rep back in Nam.
Anyway, I’m glad to be workin’ with ya, and… this place may not be
heaven, but at least you’re out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Am I?</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Pretty soon we’ll all be out of a job.
Somebody oughta blow it to hell and keep fightin’ simple.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: He’s the one going in?</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Going in? He looks like he just came
out.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: There he is – ’morning, John.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Sir.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: This is Marshall Murdock, he is in charge
of special operations from Washington.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Thank you, Colonel; I’ve been looking
forward to meeting you. So how was the trip – no problem?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: None except for this damn heat, right?
Never felt anything like it. Anyway, let’s get down to business – Rambo,
I glanced through your files and I must say it provided interesting
reading. Rambo, John J., born 7/6/47 Bowie, Arizona of
Indian-Italian-German descent. Joined army 8/6/64. Accepted, Special
Forces specialization, light weapons, crossed-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified – 59 confirmed kills –</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: … two Silver Stars, four Bronze, four
Purple Hearts, Distinguished Service Cross, and the Medal of Honor… You
did get around, didn’t you… incredible. Now you’re probably aware that
there are still nearly twenty-five hundred Americans missing in action
in Southeast Asia. Most of these boys are presumed killed. But to the
League of Families – Congress, and to a lot of Americans, it’s still a
very emotional issue. Get me something cold, please.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Rambo, you certainly don’t know as much
about me as I do about you, but I was honching with the Second
Battalion, Third Marines at Kom Tum in sixty-six and lost a lot of good
men, so I know what you and every Vet feels. Maybe the government didn’t
care, maybe certain sectors of the public didn’t care but my committee
cares. It may have been a bad war, but the men weren’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: So what his committee needs is conclusive
proof that Americans are being held.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: And once done, you can be assured we’ll get
our men back… If there’s any of our men left at the P.O.W. targer camp
you’ll confirm their presence by taking photographs.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Photographs?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Just photographs. Then you turn those
photos over to me.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I’m supposed to leave them?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Not exactly – the phrase two Delta Force
assault team led by Colonel Trautman will handle the extraction.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Anyway, I want to say that with your
participation I feel this mission has a better than average chance of
succeeding where others have failed… I’ll meet you both at the
operations center in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: From Thailand, across Laos, into the
mountains of Vietnam to the drop zone. You’ll be flying a ceiling of 250
feet when you bail out, can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Give it a try –</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: The code name for the insertion and
extraction flight team is “Dragonfly”; home base “Wolf Den,” your code
name if “Lone Wolf.” Since you’re going solo, you are going to have to
rely upon more equipment than you’ve ever used before, and use it – so
what I’m sayin’ is, don’t try the “blood and guts” routine, let
technology do most of the work. If you need assistance, call for it.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let your fingers do the walking.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: … Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: … There’s your ride.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: All of this is for you.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Impressed?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Besides the monitoring devices you see
here, you’ll be issued every ultra-modern piece of equipment to insure
your safety. Rambo, you can feel totally safe because today we have the
most advanced weapons in the world available to us.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I believe the mind is the best weapon.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: … Times change.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: For some people.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: … Amen.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: This is true – Don’t let me interrupt,
Colonel –</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Upon insertion, call in to base camp by
Transat – proceed to Point Hawk September for rendezvous with ground
contact – indigenous agent Co Bao.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Is he listening?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Indigenous agent Co Bao.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Colonel, are you sure he’s not still
unbalanced from the war? We can’t afford to have anyone involved who
might crack under pressure in that hell.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Pressure? Let me just say that Rambo’s the
best combat Vet I’ve ever seen. A pure fighting machine with only a
desire, to win a war someone else lost, and if winning means he has to
die, he’ll die. No fear. No regrets… one more thing… what you choose to
call “Hell”, he calls home.</p>
<p><strong>loudspeaker</strong>: D-minus 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: The Prince of Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: That was his nickname in Nam – ‘Prince of
Darkness’. At night he’d go out alone and hunt Cong, then come back at
dawn… no questions asked. Man has style.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Thirty-six hours to get the hell in and
out, so don’t stop to smell the roses, okay? If there is any trouble,
try like hell to get to the Hawk September extraction sight marked on
your map.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Ready to roll, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Good luck, son.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Remember when Murdock said he was with Second
Battalion, Third Marines at Kom Tum in ’66…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: The Second Battalion was at Kud Sank.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: All set?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Think he’ll find someone?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: P.O.W.’s… doubtful… but there’s people to
satisfy. Questions that have to be answered.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You don’t sound too emotional about
it.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: It wasn’t my war, Colonel. I’m just here to
clean up the mess.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: AWACS two-five has acquired. They are
holding time line… Affirmative Wolf Den… Over.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Back in the Badlands, my man.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: … Party time.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Stand by your position – insertion, minus
fifteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Five seconds, four, three, two. Jumper
away.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Shit! What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: He’s hung up!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: He’ll be torn apart!!</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: What’s happening?!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Condition Red! He’s hung up!?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: What do you mean “hung up”?!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: He’s being dragged! Lifer cut him
loose.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Can’t reach him! – pull out before we get
killed!!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Ericson, abort mission! Pull out!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: It’ll kill him to change course!</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Pull out you bastard! Climb!</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: He’s out!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: … Out where?</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: What’s happened back there?</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: … Malfunction.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Nothing’s coming in from Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Dragonfly, this is Wolf Den, over.
Dragonfly, do you read?</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: This is Dragonfly One, over.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Any visual bearings?</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: … Negative.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: We didn’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Maybe the smart thing to do is abort the
mission now before there’s any more complications. I mean who could’ve
survived something like that?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: He’s got to be given the benefit of the
doubt. He has 36 hours to carry out the mission and reach the extraction
site, we owe him that.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: … Of course we do – but understand in 36
hours we pull out.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Don’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Let me go, please!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Co Bao – Are you the one they send? Rambo?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I was hiding – you did not come on time. I
thought you one of mercenaries still here. You did not expect a woman,
no? Better speak English, yes?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We better get moving.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Yes, we go to river… Why you so late?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Got hung up.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I have arranged transportation down river – old
routes not safe.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Salt of the earth, yes?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Pirates?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Best way down river – not get army
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: Wa-ky number one. You come number one
sampan.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Thank you, Captain, for your hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: This is the man who wants to go down river.
You speak Viet?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: He does not understand.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: You have money?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Half now… half later.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: We leave now. It’s safer – … Want a drink?
Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: You stay here – you want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What about patrol boats?</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: We will have no problems.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You want to rest?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: That settles that – we eat, yes?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Want it back?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: No, you eat – How you get into this?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Long story.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Long ride.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: My father work for intelligence agency – He
killed, and I take his place – Too much death here. Death everywhere… I
just want to live, Rambo. What you want?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … To win, to survive.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … To survive.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Not so easy to survive here – Still war
here.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … To survive war, you have to become war.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: That why they pick you because you like to
fight?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … I’m expendable.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Ex-pend-a-ble?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Know what it means?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Don’t tell me… It mean if you invited to party
and you do not show up, it does not matter? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: It bring me good luck – What bring you good
luck?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Any further reports?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: None so far.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I want to go out with the extraction team
at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Denied.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Denied?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: He deserves a chance.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Colonel, we’re a team here. It’s everyone’s
worry – I just think all things considered it’s an unnecessary risk.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: We have a schedule to keep.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: With who? We don’t even know if Rambo’s
alive.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: The odds are against it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Look, you said we go through as
planned.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: But, if you want to go through with it, we
will! The Colonel will be joining the extraction team… You’re a good
man, Trautman.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You wait here… We come back, then pay rest…</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … Looks empty.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: We should move closer.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Cyclo-girl whore from village. Business slow
there. She makes him good deal… very good deal.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: A bow – no sound.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: That all you have?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You not going in there? – But I thought you were
supposed only to take pictures.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: What about orders?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Out here orders stop and people start.</p>
<p><strong>ext. under guard barracks #2 - rambo’s pov - sgt. tay
-</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Come to get you out –</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: … You American?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Don’t talk – don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: There are others –</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … We’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Can you walk?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: I think so –</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: He is Rambo. I am Co.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Banks – Lieutenant – Air Force.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … We must get to the river… Fast!</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: … Thank you… you’re a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: You have clearance.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Minus one hour to extraction.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: We’re probably just wasting fuel.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Let’s get moving!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: L.Z. two K’s up river.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Good thing you came when you did.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Why’s that.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: They move us around a lot… to harvest crops.
Only been there a week.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Only a week?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: … Yes.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: When last time you in camp here?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Maybe a year… Hey, what year is it?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … 1984… Camp supposed to be empty?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Something not good about mission, uh, Rambo?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: What has happened?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We’re sold out.</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: Whore!</p>
<p><strong>kinh</strong>: You help this – American pig!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Get to the shore!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Take him and jump!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … Knew you were a good man.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … I won’t be needin’ it now… Trade you.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: There’s explosives in the pouch.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … It better I stay till end.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: This is the end.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … I want to stay… Now we have chance, why don’t
you take me back?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: America… You can do if you want – take me back
as wife… You don’t have to live with. Just help me get away from
this.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: I came for P.O.W.’s – How would it look if I
came back with a wife?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Look like you hell of a man.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: What the matter? Not allow to feel – maybe dead
inside already. Don’t we die soon enough. Just thought I’d ask.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Rambo… you not expendable.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That’s Rambo! – Christ, he’s found one.
Relay the command. Rambo’s found one of ours!</p>
<p><strong>telecom tech</strong>: Mr. Murdock… I have an AWACS relay.
Dragonfly reports the ground team has what appears to be an American
P.O.W. with them.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>telecom tech</strong>: They’ve got one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: This station is now on Condition Bravo.
Harrison! Meyers! Goodell! Out… now!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Go to your COMINT priority push. Give me
the mike… Dragonfly, this is Wolf Den Six. This is an Alpha- Kilo-Victor
command priority.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Roger, Wolf Den Six… go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: I want you to abort the operation
immediately. I say again, abort. This is a recall, confirm, over.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Say again, Wolf Den Six.</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: I’ve been ordered to abort before
pickup.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: He must be crazy! Confirm it!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Confirmation’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: … Murdock, for Christ sake, we have them
in sight! Murdock! Do you read?!! We’re going down.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: What the Hell are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: Can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: We’re independent contractors. We take our
orders from who’s paying.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Goddamn mercenaries! There’s men down
there! Our men!</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Not our men, your men! Don’t be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: … Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: What’re you doing? Do you know what the
hell you’ve done?!!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Don’t act so innocent, Colonel. You had
your suspicions, and if you suspected then, you’re sort of an accessory,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Don’t ever count me with you and your
scum. It was a lie, wasn’t it? Just like the whole damn war, a lie!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: The camp was supposed to be empty. Rambo
goes in… a former decorated Vet. He finds no P.O.W.’s. The Congress buys
it, case closed. If he gets caught, no one knows he’s alive except you
and your computers, and you can reprogram that, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Who do you think you’re talking to,
Trautman?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: A stinking bureaucrat trying to cover his
ass!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Not just mine, Trautman, a nation’s! It was
your hero’s fault. If your “warrior” had done what the hell he was told,
we’d be out of this clean and simple. All he was supposed to do is to
take pictures!</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: And if the pictures showed something they
would’ve been lost, wouldn’t they?!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Look, I don’t think you understand what
this is all about, Trautman!</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Same as it always is, money. In ’72 we
were supposed to pay the “Cong” four and a half billion in war
reparations, we reneged, and they kept the P.O.W.’s, and now you’re
doing it all over again!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: And what the hell would you suggest we do
if some burnt-out P.O.W. shows up on the six o’clock news – fight the
war all over again? Have an invasion! Bomb Hanoi? Do you think anybody
is going to get on the floor of the United States Senate and ask
billions of dollars for a couple of forgotten ghosts!</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Men! Men who died for their country, you
bastard!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Enough, I’m going to forget this meeting
ever took place, and I’d advise you to never make the mistake of
bringing this subject up again.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You’re the one who’s making the
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: What “mistake?”</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: … Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: These people are so vulgar in their
methods. They lack compassion. I am Lieutenant Podovsk. I do not know
who you are yet – But I will. … Inside.</p>
<p><strong>p.o.w.</strong>: He’s dead now.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: In the chair.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Thank you, Captain Vinh. Leave one guard
please.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I see you are no stranger to pain… Is it
possible you have been among my Vietnamese comrades before? No answer. I
see. Do you wish to tell me your name – what harm can that cause?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Pride is a poor substitute for
intelligence… Well, no matter. What you must understand is that we have
to interrogate you. We will find out what you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: To Sergeant Yushin, you are a piece of
meat, a laboratory experiment. To me, you are a comrade similar to
myself just opposed by a matter of fate.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I know you were trying to facilitate the
release of war criminals held by this republic. I can appreciate this
–</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: But this – your capture – this incident is
– embarrassing. You must understand. We must have explanation. First I
wish for you to radio back to your headquarters and say you found no
prisoners, that your operation was a failure.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: No? You wish to test your strength – very
good. Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: The name –</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Comrade, here is something you might be
interested in.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: A transcript of the conversation between
your helicopter pilot and his commander we intercepted. Mmmm.
“Dragonfly… Slam Dunk.” Colorful names. Here we are – “Ah, Coach One… we
have them in sight.” And the reply – “Abort the operation immediately.
Return to base camp.”</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: It seems they abandoned you on direct
orders. These are the people you protect with your pain? – You may
scream. There is no shame.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Good… You are strong – The strongest so far
– but you are nearly dead – for what? Make the radio call… yes?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Yushin has a memento for you of this
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: … Put it in his eye.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: If your life means nothing, perhaps his
does.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: You will talk.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: … Yes?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Don’t say nothin’! Do what you want.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: … Yes?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Only fools die for a lost cause.</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: I trust you know the proper transmit
coordinates, yes?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: You will state your name – that you’ve been
captured as a spy! You will state that the mission was a failure and all
missions will fail. Tell them not to attempt such hostile aggression
again. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Do it now!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … 220-56 Lone Wolf – receive.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Wolf Den – This is… Lone Wolf – do you read?
Over.</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: Lone Wolf! This is Wolf Den.
Transmit location and status, over.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: … It’s Rambo, sir.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: We read you, Lone Wolf – what is your
position – over.</p>
<p><strong>radio operator</strong>: What’s your position, over?</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: … Your position will be death if you do not
answer.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: John, this is Trautman – where the hell
are you?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Johnny, come in!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Murdock.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Rambo – This is Murdock – we’re glad you’re
alive… where are you? Give us your position and we’ll come and get you,
over.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Murdock, I’m coming to get you.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Find! Now!</p>
<p><strong>podovsk</strong>: Find and kill him.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … We safe for now – you look like hell,
Rambo.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Tough night.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … maybe need this again.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You hurt bad… Not so in-vo-nerable after
all.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … No.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You rest a while, I watch.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … I’ll watch.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … What you do, Rambo? Try to get across to
Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: Then America.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: You take me with you, Rambo? I give you one more
chance.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … You don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I know enough – you take me?</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: I think you make a good choice.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … Yeah. Better move.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … No!!!</p>
<p><strong>co</strong>: … You good man, Rambo… good. Not forget me.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Do you really think that you can threaten
me, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: I want the rescue team ready to go in one
hour.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: You’re risking your career, your reputation
and your family’s security – do you think any one person is worth that,
Trautman?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: … Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: I’m giving you a direct order to withdraw
from this project.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Do I get the rescue team, or do I have to
go over your head?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Colonel, it’s time you understand I’m in
charge here – here you’re a tool, we’re the machine – I want him placed
under arrest. He’s not to leave the base.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: He never had a chance did he?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: … Like you said, he went home.</p>
<p><strong>tay</strong>: We got him!</p>
<p><strong>russian #8</strong>: No, this way… where are you?</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: You see? Not a demon. A man. Now, we find
where he’s crawled to die.</p>
<p><strong>vinh</strong>: Everyone back!!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>yushin</strong>: Drop the napalm!</p>
<p><strong>yushin</strong>: Goddamn him!!</p>
<p><strong>ericson</strong>: It’s time…</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: Yeah. Alert everyone, start packing, we’re
pulling out now.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>murdock</strong>: It’s finished, Colonel…</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>rambo huey/russian helicopter attack sequence to be
filmed</strong>: AS PER STORYBOARDS.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: That’s Thailand?</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: We’re home! We’re home!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Lone Wolf to Wolf Den – Do you read?</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: We hear you, Lone Wolf. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Prepare for emergency landing. Arriving with
American P.O.W.’s! Over?</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You heard. Prepare for arriving
P.O.W.’s.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: We win… you lose! Mission Accomplished!</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: There’s more men still out there, find them,
or I’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>banks</strong>: … Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: John… Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: … I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You’ll get a second medal of honor for
this.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: You should give it to them… They deserve it
more.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: You can’t keep running. You’re free now…
Come back with us.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Back to what? – My friends died here… part of
me died here.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: John, the war, everything that happened
here may have been wrong, but dammit, John, you can’t hate your country
for it.</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Hate? – I’d die for it.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: Then, what is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: What do I want? I want what they want… And
what every other guy who came over here and spilled his guts and gave
everything he had wants… for our country to love us as much as we love
it… That’s what I want. And that’s what they wanted.</p>
<p><strong>trautman</strong>: How will you live, John?</p>
<p><strong>rambo</strong>: Day by day.</p>
