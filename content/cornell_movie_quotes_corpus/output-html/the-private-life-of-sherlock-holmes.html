<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in
London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened
until fifty years after my death.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: It contains certain mementos of my
long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an
art – the world’s first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting
detective.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: It was August of 1887, and we were
returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of
Colonel Abernetty.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: You may recall that he broke the
murderer’s alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in
the butter on a hot day.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: He was the most brilliant man I have
ever known – and I dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat
with him in Baker Street.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: I’ll grant you he was stimulating –
but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often
than not, completely infuriating – as our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can
attest – bless her kind soul.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I do wish you’d give me a little more
warning when you come home unexpected. I would have roasted a goose –
and had some flowers for you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My dear Mrs. Hudson – criminals are as
unpredictable as head-colds. You never quite know when you’re going to
catch one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I’ll unpack your bags.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Here’s an advance copy of Strand Magazine.
They’ve printed ‘The Red-Headed League!’</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Would you like to see how I treated it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I can hardly wait. I’m sure I’ll find out
all sorts of fascinating things about the case that I never knew
before.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Just what do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, come now, Watson, you must admit that
you have a tendency to over-romanticize. You have taken my simple
exercises in logic and embellished them, exaggerated them…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I deny the accusation.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You have described me as six-foot-four,
whereas I am barely six-foot-one.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A bit of poetic license.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You have saddled me with this improbable
costume, which the public now expects me to wear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’s not my doing. Blame it on the
illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’ve made me out to be a violin virtuoso.
Here –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The fact is that I could barely hold my own
in the pit orchestra of a second-rate music hall.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re much too modest.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You have given the reader the distinct
impression that I am a misogynist. Actually, I don’t dislike women – I
merely distrust them. The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the
soup.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s those little touches that make you
colorful –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Lurid is more like it. You have painted me
as a hopeless dope addict – just because I occasionally take a five per
cent solution of cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A seven per cent solution.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Five per cent. Don’t you think I’m aware
you’ve been diluting it behind my back?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: As a doctor – and as your friend – I
strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My dear friend – as well as my dear doctor –
I only resort to narcotics when I am suffering from acute boredom – when
there are no interesting cases to engage my mind. Look at this – an
urgent appeal to find six missing midgets.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Did you say midgets?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Six of them – the Tumbling Piccolos – an
acrobatic act with some circus.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Disappeared between London and Bristol …
Don’t you find that intriguing?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Extremely so. You see, they are not only
midgets – but also anarchists.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Anarchists?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: By now they have been smuggled to Vienna,
dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores. They are to greet the
Czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the railway station. They
will be carrying bouquets of flowers, concealed in each bouquet will be
a bomb with a lit fuse.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not at all. The circus owner offers me five
pounds for my services – that’s not even a pound a midget.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh. And it sounded so promising –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There are no great crimes anymore, Watson.
The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality. At best they
commit some bungling villainy, with a motive so transparent that even a
Scotland Yard official can see through it.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Mrs. Hudson!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Yes? What is it? What have I done
now?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There is something missing from my desk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Missing?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Something very crucial. You have been
tidying up against my explicit orders.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Oh, I made sure not to disturb
anything.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part of
my filing system. By the thickness of it, I can date any document
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Some of the dust was this thick.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That would be March, 1883.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: How can you stand this? Why don’t you
let me air the room out?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Please, Mrs. Hudson – he’s working on a
definitive study of tobacco ash.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I’m sure there’s a crying need for
that.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to
distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a
Jamaican cigar. Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of
ashes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: All of which will end up on my rug.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’ll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: All right. If you gentlemen want to
stay here and suffocate…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She’s right. I am suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let me open a window.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not from lack of air – from lack of
activity. Sitting here week after week – blowing smoke rings – staring
through a microscope – there’s no challenge in that.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Personally, I consider it a major
contribution to scientific criminology…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: How I envy you your mind, Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But my
mind rebels against stagnation. It’s like a racing engine, tearing
itself to pieces because it’s not connected up with the work for which
it was built.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, where is your self-control?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Fair question.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thoroughly. But this will take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: Naturally, I don’t mean to imply
that my friend was always on cocaine – sometimes it was opium, sometimes
it was hashish. And once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was
no telling how long it would last.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The only reason you moved in with me is to
have a steady supply of stimulants.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now, now, Watson – you mustn’t underestimate
your other charms.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself in
there once more –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I intend to do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not until you replace this needle. It is
getting rather blunt.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I made you some tea and cress
sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mrs. Hudson, I want you to pack my bags.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Are you going away for the weekend?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And beyond. I’m moving out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Moving out?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m just as surprised as you are.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You heard me, Mrs. Hudson. And let’s not
waste any time.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: May I be so bold as to ask where you’er
going?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t know yet. But I intend to resume my
practice. I am, after all, a doctor. And quite a competent one, if I say
so as shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’ll find it very dull – snipping out
tonsils and flushing out kidneys –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If you’re looking for your medical bag, you
hid it under the Moorish table. Which shows a little more imagination
than last time – when it was under your bed.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I will, of course, continue to pay my half
of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where am I going to find anyone who will put
up with my rather eccentric habits?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Here’s a fresh needle – and here’s my
farewell present to you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: If you want to destroy yourself, go right
ahead. But I won’t sit by and watch you doing it.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: It’s so sad. You and Mr. Holmes – after
all these years –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Please, Mrs. Hudson – none of that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I’ll wash this and send it on to
you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ll be at Brown’s Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I know how it feels – I once went
through a divorce myself.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Actually, I’m rather looking forward to it.
Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours – nine to three – and
if occasionally there’s an emergency call in the middle of the night, I
know it’s going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go
mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained
collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his
behind –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Mr. Holmes…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Please, Mrs. Hudson. You’re in my line of
fire.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: How many times have I told you I will
not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? I should have evicted you
when you shot them holes in my wall.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Merely celebrating Her Majesty’s Golden
Jubilee.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Look at that mess you made –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s all right, Mrs. Hudson. I’ll clean it
up – – while you unpack my things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Unpack?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You heard him.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it
must’ve been for you –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not really. It was simple choice between a
bad habit and a good companion.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’ve made me very happy.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’ve often been accused of being cold and
unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I’m
very fond of you, Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I know that. But one likes to hear these
things occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look at this. Covered with that nasty stuff.
I’d better dry it off.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: For a moment, I was worried that you were
going to let me walk out – that you weren’t even going to try to stop
me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now, Watson – you know there’s nothing I
wouldn’t do to keep you here.</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: It was not the first not the last
time he tricked me like that. Normally, I was inclined to forgive
him…</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: But on one occasion, he did
something that was so utterly unforgivable, that I would gladly have
murdered him – had it not been for my saintly disposition.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes? Why
won’t you go? It’s the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet
– the house has been sold out for months –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: – seats are going for a guinea apiece –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s precisely it. Why should someone send
up two free tickets? Anonymously, at that.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Whoever sent them must be in great distress.
The note says –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I suspect it’s some sort of plot.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You mean somebody wants to lure us into a
trap…?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Somebody wants to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Kill you?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s right. It’s a plot to bore me to
death. I detest ballet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: But this isn’t just any ballet. It’s Swan
Lake.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You know, of course, Holmes – that swan
isn’t really a swan – it’s an enchanted princess.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: H’mmmm.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Fabulous woman, don’t you think so,
Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The great Petrova.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Very strong arches, I must admit.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: They say twelve men have died for her.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Six committed suicide, four were killed in
duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s only eleven.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The man who fell from the gallery landed on
top of another man in the orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That makes an even dozen – in a messy sort
of way.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Mister Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of
the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: This is Dr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Pleased to meet you. You are enjoying?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Immensely.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your
health?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My health? Better consult my doctor.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, he’s in excellent shape.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Any insanity in your family? Diabetes?
Asthma?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Would you mind telling me what this is all
about?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Certainly. Madame Petrova, she has
problem.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Could you be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Certainly not.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A liason with a crowned head? Compromising
letters? Blackmail?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: After performance, there will be little
celebration backstage – and Madame requests your presence.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We’d be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: You are invited, also.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is
expecting you in her dressing room. Dr. Watson, you will amuse yourself
meanwhile – we have vodka, caviar, girls.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: No girls?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No caviar. Makes me break out in hives.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki.
Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Any of you girls understand English?</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Nyet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Not one single word?</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Nyet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: In that case, I don’t mind telling you that
you all have lovely po-pos.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you – this is
no ordinary case.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It is only the extraordinary that interests
me.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Good. Because you will find this extra-
extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame Petrova prinimaet?</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Pozhaluista voidite.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa,
doragaia.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Otchen rada.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame says you are shorter than she
thought.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I didn’t mean to be.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: No eto nie vazhno. Menia interessujut
glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Short, tall, who cares? It is the brains
that count.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia.
Zamiechatelno! Os sobenno sobaka Baskervillei.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame is great admirer of yours. She has
read every story – her favorite is Big Dog from Baskerville.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m afraid it loses something in
translation.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles. What
is your opinion of this?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: ‘Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno
1709.’ Well, the label is authentic. Judging from the shape, the color
of the varnish, and the tone, I would say it is a genuine Stradivarius
of the best period.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: You like?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot
menia.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Here – take it. Madame says it is
yours.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Mine?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: For services you will render.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My fees as a detective are not exactly
trifling – but a Stradivarius – you’re not serious.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: I am not. But Madame is.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom
dielo.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: All right. I will pour vodka and explain.
Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final
performance of Madame Petrova. She is retiring.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What a shame.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: She has been dancing since she was three
years old. And after all, she is now thirty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I must say she doesn’t look
thirty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: That is because she is forty-nine. So
Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her
child.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: How admirable.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Problem now is to find father.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh? Is he missing?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And that’s why you called me in?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Also correct. We must have father, because
without father, how can there be child?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I see. The whole thing is still in the
planning stage –</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Correct again. Madame would like child to
be brilliant and beautiful. Since she is beautiful – she now needs man
who is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Za zdorovie.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Za zdorovie.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Za zdrovie.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: What does it taste like?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Red pepper.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: That’s what’s in it.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame wants to know how soon you can be
ready.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: To leave for Venice. All arrangements have
been made. You will spend one week there with Madame…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, this is all very flattering. But
surely there are other me – better men –</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: To tell you truth, you were not first
choice. We considered Russian writer, Tolstoi –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s more like it. The man’s a genius.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Too old… Then we considered the
philosopher, Nietzsche –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Absolutely first-rate mind…</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Too German… And we considered Tschaikowski
–</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, you couldn’t go wrong with Tschaikowski
–</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: We could – and we did. It was
catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: You don’t know? Because Tschaikowski – how
shall put it? Women not his glass of tea.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Pity, that.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim
resheniem.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame is very happy with final
choice.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame mustn’t be too hasty. She must
remember I’m an Englishman.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You know what they say about us. If there’s
one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it’s our love-making. We are
not exactly the most romantic of people –</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Perfect. We don’t want sentimental idiots
– falling in love, committing suicide. One week in Venice – she goes
back to St. Petersburg with baby – you go back to London with
fiddle.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: An equitable arrangement. About my medical
history – when you asked me – I neglected to mention a small detail.
There is hemophilia in my family. We’re all bleeders.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut
ghemofilijei.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Pust nie bezpokoitsa. Ja ostrighu sebe
noghti.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame says not to worry. She will not
scratch you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s reassuring to know. But –</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Pochemu on kolebletsa? On nie nahodit menia
dostatochno privlekatelnoi?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Madame says you talk too much. You find
her attractive or no?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Excuse me. What does prokanzik mean?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: It means ‘You little devil.’</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It does? I am? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: I repeat question. You find Madame
attractive or no?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, I find her most attractive – for a
woman, that is.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Then no problem.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Maybe a slight one. You see, I am not a free
man.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Not free? You are a bachelor.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A bachelor – living with another bachelor –
for the last five years. Five very happy years.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: What is it you are trying to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I hoped I could avoid the subject. But some
of us – through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature –</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Get to point.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The point is that Tschaikowski is not an
isolated case.</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: You mean, you and Dr. Watson – ? He is
your glass of tea?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If you want to be picturesque about it.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Chto on govorit? Pri chom tut
Chaikovsky?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: On pederast.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Jescho odin? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno!
Kakoi vi idiot!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Believe me, Madame, the loss is all mine.
But I would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a
gondola in Venice.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It would have been catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong>petrova</strong>: Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe,
prezhde chem posoritj menia!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson! Watson, are you coming?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is it, old boy?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’re going home.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest – not
the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Hold on! Just a moment!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What’s going on? What happened to the
girls?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Why? Do you not prefer it this way?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What way?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: You don’t have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told
us everything – about you and him –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: About me and him?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Come now, no need to be bashful. We are
not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual – but in
ballet, is very usual.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel
and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri –</p>
<p><strong>rogozhin</strong>: – And Ilya and Sergei – Sergei – half and
half.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There you are, you wretch! You rotter! You
blackguard! Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. What do you have
to say for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Don’t just sit there – speak up, man!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes…? Are you all right, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: From the sound of your footsteps, I gathered
that you were not in a particularly amiable mood.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How could you do a dastardly thing like that
to me? What the deuce were you thinking of?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, you have my most abject apologies.
But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman? It seemed like the only
way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What about my feelings? And my reputation?
Do you realize the gravity of what you have done? The possible
repercussions?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So there’ll be a little gossip about you in
St. Petersburg…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: These things spread like wildfire. I can
just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. I’ll never be able to
show my face in polite society…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, you’re running amok.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized. What am I
to do?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, for one thing, I’d get rid of that
flower.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You may think this is funny, but we’re both
in the same boat. We must take desperate measures. We must stop this
talk… Maybe if we got married…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Then they’d really talk…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Obviously, we cannot continue to live under
the same roof. We must move apart.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Of course, we can still see each other
clandestinely – on remote benches in Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms
of suburban railway stations –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The whole thing is ridiculous. We have
nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s what I’ve been trying to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let somebody start a rumor – just one ugly
word – and we’ll sue them for slander.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nobody would dare. After all, you have an
enviable record with the fair sex.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Damn right. I can get women from three
continents to testify for me. And you can get women to vouch for you,
too – can’t you, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Can you, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Good night, Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, let me ask you a question – I hope
I’m not being presumptuous – but there have been women in your life?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The answer is yes. You’re being
presumptuous. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes…</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: What, indeed, was his attitude
toward women? Was there some secret he was holding back – or was he just
a thinking machine, incapable of any emotion?</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: I was not to get the answer until we
became involved in what I consider to be the most outrageous case in all
our years together.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Were you expecting someone?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not at this hour.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I never found her so.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is it, Mrs. Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: There’s a cabbie here – he says you owe
him two-and-six.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: For the fare, guv’nor. The young lady
doesn’t have any money.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What young lady?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: This one.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well. What have we here? Who are you, miss?
What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: That’s all she keeps saying – I don’t know,
I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Where did she come from?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: From the river. I was driving down the
Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the
water – drowning.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: It wasn’t easy, guv’nor – what with the cold
water – and her fighting me –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why did you bring her here?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Because I found this in her hand – – 221B
Baker Street – that’s right, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Young lady – what did you want at this
address?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I do not remember.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Rather perplexing, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Rather.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Well, gentlemen, you want her? – it’s
two-and-six – or shall I throw her back in the river?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Mr. Holmes. You can’t let him –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, you’d better accept delivery.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Keep the change.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Thank you, guv’nor.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: No extra charge for the use of the horse-
blanket.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re shivering, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Sit here, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: She’s suffering from shock and exposure.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There was some printing on the back of this
– but it seems to have come off in the water.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look at this – she’s had a nasty blow on the
head.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No. The blood has already coagulated. So it
would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack… Get my bag,
will you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m Dr. Watson – and this is Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. Do the names mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Think.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Can you think of your own name?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: She’s obviously had a concussion – which
often leads to temporary amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So all we know is that she was coshed on the
head, dumped into the Thames, and subsequently dumped into our laps.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We know a lot more than that. From her
accent, we know she is foreign – from her ring, we know she is married –
and there is one other clue we have… Something I deduced while I was
helping her up the stairs. No corset.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Good work.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Are you French? Vous etes Francaise?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Non, je ne suis pas Francaise.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How can she say she’s not French, in
French?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Vous etes Suisse?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Non.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Alors, vous etes Belge.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Je suis pas sure.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Vous etes Belge – de Bruxelles!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Bruxelles? Oui… Je pense que oui.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Oh, dash. Will someone remove the
violin, please?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We just found out that she’s Belgian.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Poor thing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: From Brussels.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Your name is Gabrielle, is that right?
Gabrielle?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And your husband’s name is Emile?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Emile…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where is he? What are you doing in
London?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: When did you arrive from Brussels? Where are
you staying?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What happened at the river? Think! Pensez!
Concentrez vous!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’s enough, Holmes. I will not permit you
to question her in this condition. Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed.
I’ll sleep on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Come, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’d better mix her a sleeping potion.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, I think we should arrange to have
her removed to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Under no circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She should have medical attention.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: She can get that from me. But more
importantly, she must be protected – there has already been one attempt
on her life.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: This temporary amnesia – how temporary is
it?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It depends on the extent of the injury. It’s
like veils shrouding her memory. It could clear up in a few days – or a
few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, this is a very small flat – we don’t
want to clutter it up with women…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, we’ve never had a case like this. A
woman comes to us with a problem – we don’t know who the woman is – and
we don’t know what the problem is. Don’t you find that challenging?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quite. But we can’t afford to wait for those
veils to lift – we must break through them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You really feel it’s that urgent?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I do. The sooner we solve the case, the
sooner we can get rid of her.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Emile?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Emile?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Emile? Is that you, Emile?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, Gabrielle.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Ah, Emile. I thought I’d never find you.
Hold me. Hold me tight. It’s been such a long time. So many nights. You
know what I did before I left Brussels?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I hope you won’t be angry with me. I
bought myself an expensive negligee.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: A pink negligee with maribou feathers.
Don’t you think that’s a foolish thing for a married woman? Come.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where is the negligee?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: In my luggage… Come here.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And where is your luggage?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know. Come, my love. Come.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: What is it, Emile? What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Dr. Watson! Your porridge is getting
lumpy. Hadn’t you better get up?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I would like to very much. But –
Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your knee in the small of my
back?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Yes, I would.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Please! I’m in excruciating pain.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A bit higher – just below my seventh
vertebra – That’s good. Put your arms under mine – fold them behind my
neck –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Bless you. That damn couch. You’d better see
if our patient is awake.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Dr. Watson. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Gone?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! Holmes! She’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Well, I never!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Mmmmm. I smell porridge. Lumpy as usual, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just
wondering – how –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: We certainly were.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Mrs. Hudson, why don’t you go down to the
kitchen – get a towel – and wipe that look of disapproval off your
face.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Liberties – in my house!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You can’t really blame her – I mean, the way
it looks – if I didn’t know you better, I might suspect you’d taken
advantage of the young lady.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: As a matter of fact, I did take advantage of
her… Would you hand me the butter- knife, please?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are
your professional ethics? Have you no sense of decency, no shame –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: None whatsoever. If you must know, I found
her body quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You cad!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Especially the palm of her right hand.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’d rather not hear about it!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Very well. Then I won’t bother to tell you
how I traced her suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’s her suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with
our address on it? It was a luggage ticket – the number rubbed off on
her hand. And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat
train, I concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria
Station.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: By Jove! If you’re right, we should find a
clue to her identity.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Or at least a pink negligee with maribou
feathers.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Voila!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let’s see - what else is in here?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now we’re getting somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Who do you suppose this is?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Come in, Madame Valladon. You are Gabrielle
Valladon.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And this is your husband, Emile
Valladon?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Sorry to have ransacked your valise. But
since you came to us for help –</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: 221B Baker Street.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oh, yes… Which of you is Mr. Holmes and
which is Dr. Watson?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Dr. Watson is the handsome one.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s the way he affects most women.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Coffee. You want strong coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s all so confusing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let’s try to sort it out. You came to London
looking for your husband…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes. He’s a mining engineer. We were
married five years ago, in the Congo.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where your husband was working in a copper
mine.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Your wedding ring – it’s made of copper.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Last year he invented a new kind of air
pump, and was hired by an English company, Jonah Limited.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Here you are.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Jonah Limited. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: We’ve been writing to each other
regularly. Then suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped. I kept
writing … but no answer. Finally I decided to go to that address –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: 32 Ashdown Street.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes. It’s just an empty store – nobody
there. Then I tried to find Jonah Limited. No such company exists.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How decidedly odd.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame Valladon, can you think of any reason
why your husband should have lied to you about theses things?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Emile? Never. He loves me – and I love
him.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So I gathered.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I went to the police – they said they
would send out a missing persons report – but they didn’t sound too
encouraging. Then I went to the Belgian embassy and explained the
situation to them – and they suggested that I consult you…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You could have done worse.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I was on my way here – and suddenly there
were footsteps behind me – and a hand over my mouth – and the smell of
choloroform – and the next thing I knew I was in the water – and then a
man was wrapping me in a blanket –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill you
last night. Do you have any idea who could have done it?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t understand any of it. What does
it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where is my husband? You must help me find
him.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We’ll do our best, I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more
letter to your husband.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: To Emile Valladon – Ashdown Street – what
was that number?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: 32. What do you want me to say in the
letter?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re sending an empty sheet of paper to an
empty shop?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That empty shop is obviously being used as
an accomodation address, or letter- drop. But what gets dropped must be
picked up. The question is how? – and by whom? – and why?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hammer… Chisel.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s so strange to think I’ve been
writing to a place like this all these months.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose
this could have been a pet shop?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Maybe. Here comes our letter.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now we are faced with the most nerve-
wracking part of the detective’s job – doing nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Mr. Holmes –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know how I’m going to pay you for
all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the
Thames.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It could be worse. You could be at the
bottom of the Thames – much to your discomfort – and much to my
chagrin.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t understand how anybody picks up
letters here. No footprints – just tracks. What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I would surmise somebody is using ice-
skates – if it weren’t for a conspicuous absence of ice.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: Good morning, my pretties.
Here’s Mum with your breakfast. Did you think I’d forgotten you?</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: Some of you will be going on a
little trip soon – I hate to lose you – but even an old woman has to
live. Although you might well ask, why?</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: Oh. You never told me we had a
letter.</p>
<p><strong>first carter</strong>: Morning, Duchess.</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>second carter</strong>: What have you been doing with
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: What do you think? Taking
dancing lessons. How many do you want this time?</p>
<p><strong>first carter</strong>: Two dozen.</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: What are they doing with all
those canaries? What’s going on up there?</p>
<p><strong>second carter</strong>: Look, Duchess, we don’t know – and we
don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>first carter</strong>: When you work for Jonah, it’s better
not to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>first carter</strong>: … twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-
four.</p>
<p><strong>second carter</strong>: How about that letter? Does that go,
too?</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: No. That’s going to be picked
up in person.</p>
<p><strong>woman in wheelchair</strong>: All right, my pretties. Back to
sleep you go. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I really thought we were done for.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is
merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Did you hear what she said? You really
think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It certainly would simplify things, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs… And
what was all that about Jonah? And what do you suppose they’re doing up
there? And where is up there?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My guess would be Scotland. Inverness, to be
more precise.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Inverness?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Didn’t you notice the paper at the bottom of
their cage? The Inverness Courier.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Mr. Holmes! This letter –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s addressed to you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nevertheless –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and
Dr. Watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note.
According to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. Your brother,
Mycroft. What time do you make it, Watson?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: 11:43.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft has
miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft, I suggest you reset your watch.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t mind telling you I’m a bit
apprehensive about this.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m rather curious myself as to what is
going on in that Machiavellian mind of his.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t mean Mycroft, I mean Madame
Valladon.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s perfectly safe with
Mrs. Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Right you are. He’s expecting you in the
upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen will sign in – Surname, Christian
name, address, nature of business –</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Gentlemen…!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Jamaican, no doubt – either Tropical or
Golosina – I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Come in, come in, Sherlock – Dr. Watson…
Sit down. You’re looking very fit, both of you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And how are you, Mycroft? How’s your
gout?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Under control. Except for the occasional
twinge.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I have a treat for you – a very old Madeira
– 1814. There are only six bottles left in the world. I have two of
them, and am negotiating for a third.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: If you don’t mind my saying so, anybody
who’s susceptible to gout shouldn’t be –</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The last doctor who warned me about that
was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by
a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason. Your very good health.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why are you wasting this precious stuff on
us?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Well, I see you so rarely. How long has it
been? Not since the case of the Greek interpreter. Isn’t it ridiculous?
Two brothers living in the same town…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: In the same town, perhaps – but not the same
world.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mmmm. Superb. How old did you say it
was?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: 1814. One year before Waterloo.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: One year before Waterloo? Think of that.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: You do know where Waterloo is, don’t you,
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Belgium, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Quite. And speaking of Belgium, it has come
to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain
engineer.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Well, I can save you a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’d be grateful for any suggestion –</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: My suggestion is that you pursue it no
further.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Any particular reason?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Because it involves the national security.
We are handling this matter ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We? Who’s we?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The Diogenes Club, of course.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I have always suspected that there was some
underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified
establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: That’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is
here, there and everywhere. When there are rumblings of revolt in the
Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to
study the source of the Nile. When there is trouble along the Indian
frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas,
alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: What a fertile imagination my brother has.
At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor’s house, he
deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife
in her satchel.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: As good an explanation as any.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Yes, Wiggins?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: An immediate answer is requested,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Tell them that the three boxes go to
Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red
runner to the castle. Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why don’t you crumple it up and swallow it –
to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: My dear Sherlock, there are certain affairs
that do not come within the province of the private detective. They have
to be dealt with on an altogether different level.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: In other words, you want me to stay within
my limits.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I do indeed.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah
Limited?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it
was not merely a suggestion – it was an order!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: By whose authority?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: By the authority of Her Majesty’s
government. I hope I’ve made myself clear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Now if you’ll excuse me, gentlemen –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Goodbye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A pleasure, as always.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Just a minute. You forgot your
tool-kit.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You will be gentle, won’t you, when you tell
her you’re dropping the case?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, what does the word Glennahurich
suggest to you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s Scottish.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And like all Scottish names, it’s really a
word picture. Glen means valley, na means of the, and Hurich, if memory
serves me, means yew tree.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re just trying to impress me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So the three boxes go to the Valley of the
Yew Tree.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And I’ll be in Scotland before ye… You are
dropping the case, aren’t you, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t shoot, Mrs. Hudson – you’re liable to
lose two excellent tenants.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Oh, at last. It’s been a ghastly
experience.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Why? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Did you ever try doing embroidery with
a gun in your hand?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’ll be relieved to know it was not
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, you didn’t answer my question. Are
you planning to disobey Mycroft’s orders? He’s not just your brother,
you know. You’d be defying Her Majesty’s government…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Any news? Did you find out anything?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let’s just say I know what the next step
will be.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I want you to pack your things.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, let me caution you —</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: At 7:30 this evening, Dr. Watson and I are
going to take you to Victoria Station, and put you on the
boat-train.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The boat-train?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You’re sending me back to Brussels? Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Madame Valladon, you must understand…</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I came here to find my husband – you were
going to help me –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, my dear. But circumstances have changed
–</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The great detective! Well, maybe this
case is too small for you –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: On the contrary. It’s being handled at a
much higher level –</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Well, I won’t go back to Brussels. Maybe
you’re giving up, but I’m not. I’m going to go on looking for him. And
nobody’s going to stop me – even if they try to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Are you quite finished? If you recall, what
I said was that we’re going to put you on the boat-train – I didn’t say
you were going to stay on it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: She’s not?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: At 7:30, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will be
seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station. At
eight-twelve, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by their valet John – –
will appear at Euston Station, and board the Highland Express to
Inverness.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mr. and Mrs…. ?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you. I’m sorry for what I said.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ll go and pack.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maybe I should do it, since I’m the
valet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, what exactly are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: As you like to put it in your chronicles,
the game is afoot.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: But what game? Are you really that
interested in the Belgian engineer?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Or the wife of the Belgian engineer?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You don’t like me very much, do you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite… But
there’s more to this case than meets the eye –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Looking for something?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: My other glove.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: All right. You can look now.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Am I embarrassing you, Mr. Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not at all. Would it surprise you if I told
you I once spent the night with 121 women?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: On a very interesting case – in a harem in
Constantinople.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Sorry, father – I mean, friar – or is it
abbot?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Going to Scotland, you gentlemen? So are
we…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m a valet. My master and mistress and I
are our way to Inverness. Ever been there? Beautiful country.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those
orders that’s taken the vow of silence. Trappists, I believe you’re
called.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I see you’re reading the book of Jonah.
Funny - we were just talking about Johan this morning… Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Women are never to be trusted entirely –
not the best of them.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I didn’t say it – you did. According to
Dr. Watson.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: He gave me some back issues of Strand
Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The good doctor is constantly putting words
into my mouth.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Then you deny it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not at all. I am not a whole-hearted admirer
of womankind.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’m not very fond of them myself.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The most affectionate woman I ever knew was
a murderess.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It was one of those passionate affairs – at
odd hours – right in my laboratory. And all the time, behind my back,
she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband’s steak and kidney
pie.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You mustn’t judge all women by –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Of course not. Only the ones I was involved
with. And I don’t just mean professionally – kleptomaniacs,
nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my fiancee, for instance –</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Your fiancee?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She was the daughter of my violin teacher –
we were engaged to be married – the invitations were out, I was being
fitted for a tail-coat – and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she
died of influenza.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It just proves my contention that women are
unreliable and not to be trusted. Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Good night, Mr. Ashdown.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness. Die steigen
dort aus. Dort muessen wir ihn finded – den Valladon!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let’s see – two, three, four –</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: How do you get to Glennahurich? How far is
it?</p>
<p><strong>baggageman</strong>: Glennahurich?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You know – a valley – with a yew tree… ?</p>
<p><strong>baggageman</strong>: It’s about a mile out of town. Why would
you be wanting to go there?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well, if it’s got a view, it might be a nice
place for a picnic.</p>
<p><strong>baggageman</strong>: It’s got a view, right enough – but it’s
no place for a picnic.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>baggageman</strong>: Because it’s a cemetary.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I would think so.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The two small ones – they must be
children’s coffins.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: … earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s so sad.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Sad – and rather odd. There are no flowers –
and no mourners.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Working you hard, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: Not really. This is healthy country.
Sometimes you sit around for weeks with nothing to do. Then you get
three in one day.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: An accident. Aye. Father and two sons,
they say – they were found floating in the loch.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Local people?</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: No. Nobody around here knows them. The
story is that their boat capsized in a swell – but I don’t believe
it.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What do you believe?</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: You may think I’m an old fool or an
old drunk – but I’ve living around Loch Ness all my life…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Are you trying to tell us it was the
monster?</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids’
faces when they were pulled out of the water – looked like old men –
must’ve died of fright.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and
me, we were on our way to services, when suddenly… But what’s the
use?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Here you are, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>grave-digger</strong>: Thank you… You look like nice people.
If you’re wanting a holiday in Scotland, go to Loch Lomond, go to Holy
Loch – but stay away from Loch Ness.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: To think that people still believe in that
nonsense. Here we are, living in the Nineteenth Century –</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’m ashamed to admit it – but I was
relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys. It could possibly have
anything to do with Emile.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It would appear not.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: However, there still remains the clue of the
castle and the red runner – wherever it may be.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: If they’re unidentified graves, why are
those boys bringing flowers?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Because it’s their brothers who have just
been buried.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Their brothers?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And they’re not boys. They’re as tall as
they’ll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles, will you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Pebbles.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: They are – how do you say it in English?
– nains.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Midgets.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Boys with the faces of old men…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I still don’t see –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Would it help if I told you they were
acrobats?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Do you remember a tumbling act – six
brothers – missing from the circus?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, yes – that case you turned down – I
completely forgot.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Some of us are cursed with memories like
flypaper. And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly
useless.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Mr. Holmes, is those are not children,
then – ?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quite. The question now is – who’s in the
third grave?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! She’s fainted.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hand me that lantern.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It is Valladon, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his
wedding ring has turned green –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: – and why there are three dead canaries in
the coffin. White canaries.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You have a lovely view of the loch from
here – as soon as the morning mist rolls away. If you’ve a mind to do
any sight-seeing, here’s a guide to the local points of interest.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This way, please. I will show you to your
room.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I suppose you’re putting me in the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No, your room is in the attic.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: It’s the privy that’s in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: May I have your wedding ring, please?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Just as I thought. There is a distinct
difference in color between your ring and your husband’s. Which leads me
to believe that the cause of death was not drowning… I wish you would
stop that. Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I know it’s not easy. But you must remember
that we’re that nice couple from London, on Holiday in the
Highlands.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s much better.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now, if I may proceed without further
interruptions –</p>
<p><strong>watson’s voice</strong>: Mr. Ashdown!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mr. Ashdown!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! I saw it! I saw it from the attic!
It’s out there in the lake!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You saw what?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The telescope. Where’s the telescope?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The monster!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The monster?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There it is! There it is!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: See it? See it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I see nothing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Gone? Maybe it was never there.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I swear to you – I saw it – clear as
anything –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are
living in the Nineteenth Century –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maybe that grave-digger was right – the
swell, and the boat overturning –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the
lake – but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Asphyxiation.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There is only one substance that can turn a
copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries – chlorine
gas.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That may be. But the fact remains that I saw
something out there.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A figment of your imagination. Now let us be
logical. The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle –
The question is, which castle?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You call yourself logical? You’re the least
logical man I know.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How can you say it’s a figment of my
imagination, when for years you’ve been saying I have no imagination
whatsoever!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We have so far investigated eight drafty
castles – had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by
bagpipes – and we are exactly where we started.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Would you like some cranberry sauce,
dear?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Would you pass the cranberry sauce, please,
John?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I say there. Good afternoon. Remember
me?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Some chaps I met on the train. We had a long
conversation – or rather, I had a long conversation – because they’re
not allowed to talk – Trappists, you know. Just study their Bibles.
You’ll never guess what the one next to me was reading – the Book of
Jonah – isn’t that odd?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What is it, dear? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: A bee.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well, I don’t think we have to bother with
this castle. It’s just a pile of rubble.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Then why are they taking precautions?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why, indeed? Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: When rebuffed at the front door, one’s only
choice is to try the tradesmen’s entrance.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Sorry. No visitors allowed.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Are you the guide here?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Yes. The castle is closed to the public while
work is going on.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: It’s being restored by the Society for the
Preservation of Scottish Monuments.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Too bad. I particularly wanted my wife to
see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one of the most interesting examples
of – about 1400, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let me see – was it built under James the
Second or James the Third?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: The Thrid… If you come back next year, we’ll
be all done here, and I’ll be glad to show you around.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Pleasant sort, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one
hundred years and one James. It’s actually 1500 and James the
Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: If he’s an official guide, shouldn’t he
know… ?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If he’s an official guide.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Listen… Do you hear anything, Watson?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No. Those birds are making too much of a
racket.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: They’re not just birds – they’re our old
friends.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Sulphuric acid?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: The more we find out the less sense it
makes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal
of sense. Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine
gas. Would you mind clasping your hands, Watson?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A little lower… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That tower may be more interesting than I
thought – and not just architecturally.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, I have a feeling we’re redundant
here.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We have now observed the castle from the
front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water… what now?
Are you planning to spend the night out here?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If necessary.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re going to catch your death of cold.
Wouldn’t it be ironic if Holmes’ last case were a case of pneumonia?
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quick, Watson. After it!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, what are we doing? We should be
going away from it.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Keep rowing, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’ve lost it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: At least you admit there’s an it, not just a
figment of my imagination.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Do you have your stethoscope with you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Never without it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I can hear something…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s getting closer – closer –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I lost my parasol.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where’s Watson?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I have come face to face with man-eating
tigers – I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants – India, you
know – but I wasn’t half as frightened. This beast seems to have a
personal grudge against us.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I just hope it doesn’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I don’t think it will. Look!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What strange goings-on.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not really. My guess is that the monster,
after a hard day’s work, has returned home for his supper.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, I know. But would you believe that you
can’t borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Would you like to confide in us?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Whenever he starts whistling, I know he’s
getting close to a solution.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s nothing new, actually. We’ve come
across this situation before.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: We have? Where?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: At the ballet.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Ballet?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There’s a lake – and there’s a castle – and
there’s a swan that isn’t really a swan – or, in this case, a monster
that isn’t really a monster –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What is it indeed that feeds on canary birds
and sulphuric acid, and has an engine for a heart?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: An engine?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The stethoscope is a very sensitive
instrument, and water is an excellent conductor of sound. There is no
doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not only is it equipped with an artificial
heart, it also has artificial lungs. Judging from the bubbles on the
surface of the lake, it uses some form of air pump.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You think my husband was involved in all
this?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, Madame Valladon. I’m sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: But why would anybody build a mechanical
monster? Just to scare people?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not very likely.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Why did they try to keep me from finding
my husband? And why was he buried anonymously?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I think I have a pretty good notion of what
they’re up to – the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments –
better known as the Diogenes Club.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The Diogenes Club?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne
for you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A bottle of champagne? I didn’t order
it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These
are my instructions.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Instructions from whom? Deliver it
where?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I wouldn’t know, sir. But there’s a
carriage waiting for you downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Are you sure you have the right
Mr. Ashdown?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Quite sure, Mr. Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is
going up on the last act.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t like the sound of it.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Please be careful.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’d better take this with you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who’s minding the castle?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: You’d better get on. It’s late.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where are we going? Some sort of party?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: You won’t be disappointed in the guest
list.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who’s the host?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Jonah.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Mr. Ashdown, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The red runner, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: It’s not for you. McKeller. May I have the
champagne, please?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: 1886 – not a very good vintage, is it?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Mediocre. But then again, it’s not for
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Tie it up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Interesting – and educational.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Despite my most emphatic warning, you
persisted in meddling. It would have served you right if you’d all
drowned.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Sorry to be so unobliging. E. Valladon…
H’mm.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I imagine this belongs to the pretty lady,
and this belongs to your valet… We found them floating in the lake.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Speaking about things floating in the lake
–</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: How much do you know – or think you
know?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I think you’re testing some sort of
underwater craft – camouflauged to mislead the gullible. I think it’s an
experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. I think it is powered
by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas…
Altogether a strange contraption.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Not quite that unique. Right now, four
countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible. But none of
them could solve the critical problem – how to stay submerged long
enough to make it effective.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What does the Good Book say? “And Jonah
lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights.”</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: That was our goal. And thanks to Valladon’s
air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. It’s a highly complex
system of filtration – so we had a series of trials –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And at least one error.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: During a test run in Moray Firth, pressure
caused a leak in the hull. Sea water mixed with the acid in the
batteries to produce chlorine gas. Before they could reach the surface,
Valladon and the crew were dead.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So you had them buried in unmarked graves,
to preserve your secret.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: It was essential to keep the information
from your client.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You went to all those lengths to prevent
Madame Valladon from fiding her husband?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Your client isn’t Madame Valladon – it’s
the Imperial German Government. They were after the Belgian engineer –
or rather, his invention. They knew he was employed by us, but they
couldn’t find out where – so they enlisted the best brain in England to
help them. You, my dear brother, have been working for the
Wilhelmstrasse.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And Madame Valladon – what part did she play
in all this?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Madame Valladon is dead.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The Germans disposed of her three weeks
ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle Valladon.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The woman who was brought to your house in
the middle of the night – apparently fished out of the Thames – and
apparently suffering from amnesia – is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal,
one of their most skillful agents. Am I going too fast for one of the
“best brains in England?”</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: They planted her on you quite neatly, I
must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air
pump. Very much like using a hog to find truffles. And now perhaps you’d
care to join me. I am expecting a certain royal personage from
Balmoral.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I trust you had a pleasant journey,
Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: It was long and it was tedious. And
it had better be worth our while, Mr. Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I can assure you, Ma’am, it will be.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Now what is this curious ship we are
supposed to christen?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: We call it a submersible, Ma’am. It travels
under water.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Under water? What a fantastic
idea.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Ma’am, may present some of the scientists
who were responsible for this achievement. J.W. Ferguson, naval
architect –</p>
<p><strong>first scientist</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Professor Simpson, our leading expert on
hydraulics –</p>
<p><strong>second scientist</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: W.W. Prescott, co-inventor of the revolving
periscope –</p>
<p><strong>third scientist</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: And this is Sir Arthur Grisby, our
authority on maritime ballistics –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: We don’t claim to understand any of
this. But England is proud of you, gentlemen. To think that man can now
observe fish in their native habitat –</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Well, not exactly, Ma’am –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: – and underwater plants and coral
reefs – Young man – what was your contribution to this project?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m afraid it was rather negligible, Your
Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have
been following your exploits with great interest.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Are you engaged in one of your
fascinating cases at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: In a manner of speaking, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: When can we expect to read
Dr. Watson’s account of the case?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I hope never, Ma’am. It has not been one of
my more successful endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Ah, the ceremonies are about to
begin. Now where is this underwater ship of yours?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: In the dungeon, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: The dungeon? What a peculiar place
to keep it. Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: There she, Ma’am. Her Majesty’s Ship
Jonah.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: And what, may we ask, is the purpose
of that hideous gargoyle?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: It’s merely a decoy, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we
imagine.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Something of the sort… The crew will now
demonstrate the workings of the submersible.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Stand to.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Aren’t they rather small for
sailors?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: They are. But because of the size of the
craft, the Navy made an exception.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: They should make it a rule. It’s
quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our
toes.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: This is the main engine, which propels it
under water at the rate of two knots – the stabilizing mechanism – the
multi- stage compressor – the ballast tank trimmer – the air-pump which
filters and recirculates the air –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: How charming.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The air pump, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: The canaries. Must make the crew
feel at home.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Yes, Ma’am. These are the levers for firing
the torpedoes, which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet – the
periscope for scanning the surface of the water –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: But where is the glass bottom?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The what, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: The glass bottom.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You know – to see the fist –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: – and the plants and the corals
–</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: That’s not quite the idea, Ma’am. H.M.S.
Jonah is being commissioned as a warship.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: A warship? Stop that noise. Stop
it!</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Ma’am, if I may explain –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: You had better.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: The Admiralty regards this craft as the
ultimate weapon in naval warfare. It can seek out enemy ships and
destroy them – with these torpedoes – while remaining completely
invisible.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: You mean in can fire at other
vessels while under water?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Yes, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Without any warning?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: That is correct, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: And without showing her colors?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Indeed, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. It is
unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will
have none of it!</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I beg your pardon, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Sometimes we despair of the state of
the world. What will scientists think of next?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: That’s precisely it, Ma’am. At this very
moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a
dirigible –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: A dirigible? And what, pray, is
that?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: A rigid balloon, which could fly over
London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at
the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Nonsense. We refuse to believe that
our grandson Willie would do a thing like that.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: We have conclusive proof, Ma’am. Our agent
in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible,
and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he
could cross the border.</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: Nevertheless, we don’t want any part
of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the
better.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: May I point out, Ma’am –</p>
<p><strong>queen victoria</strong>: And don’t concern yourself about
that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to
the Kaiser. Now we wish to return to Balmoral.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been
undone by a woman. What a shame.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Not necessarily. If the Germans want that
submersible so badly, why don’t we give it to them?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Give it to them?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Invite them aboard for the final journey –
seven hundred feet – straight down.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And how are you going to arrange that?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: I’m rather counting on you to do it. Since
you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Sorry about that. But as long as you’re up –
what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And how would you say under the castle?
Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I don’t know. My German isn’t that
good.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Your Trappist friends are out there waiting
to hear from you – it’s a chilly morning – we don’t want to keep them
standing around too long, do we, Fraulein Hoffmanstal? Come now. It’s
too late to play cat and mouse.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Unter dem Schloss.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you. Here’s your signalling device –
it’s a bit damp, I’m afraid – would you care to let them know where they
can find the submersible? No? Then I’ll just have to do it myself. I
only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, it’s up to the good monks now. You can
consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein
Hoffmanstal.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You’re all wrong about me. My name isn’t
Hoffmanstal.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s von Hoffmanstal.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I stand corrected.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I suppose once they’re in the castle… It
must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s more amusing than that. Once in the
castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance – it will
take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You mean you’re going to let them have
the air-pump?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Better than that. We’re going to let them
have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all
set to go. I assume they’re all expert sailors? And since there is a
German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they’ll
try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Did you say try to?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I would suggest you get your things
together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I never had you fooled for a moment, did
I? You knew right from the beginning – when the cabbie brought me to
Baker Street.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let me see – not quite that soon.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: It’s so funny. I asked for this
assignment, you know. I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn’t
resist the challenge of coming up against the best. I’m sorry I didn’t
give you a closer game.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Close enough.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: You’re just being kind. I failed
miserably.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We all have occasional failures.
Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, I saw it again – that thing – it
came from the castle – it’s out there –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It was out there. Now it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Gone?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Forever. Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A bottle of champagne?… and a Bible?…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s all that’s left of H.M.S. Jonah.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It would seem that somebody carelessly
loosened the bolts of the submersible. What a fitting end for Trappists
– now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Do you know what he’s talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Fraulein von Hoffmanstal?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Yes, Mr. Holmes. I’m all ready.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: If there’s one thing I like about the
Prussians, it’s their punctuality.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: If there’s one thing I dislike about the
British, it’s their climate. I understand your jails are quite damp –
and your heating facilities totally inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: They are. But you’re not going to jail.
You’re going back to Germany.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Germany?</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: You will be conducted to the Swiss-German
border, and be exchanged for one of our agents – a man named
Ibbetson.</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Don’t thank me. Thank my brother. It was
his idea.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Frankly, I think we are making a very poor
deal. You much better than most operatives working for British
intelligence. Don’t you agree, Sherlock?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And better than some consulting
detectives.</p>
<p><strong>mycroft</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>gabrielle</strong>: I’ll take that. Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: All right, Holmes – you don’t have to
explain anything to me, if you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I appreciate that, Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: After all, I’m only your official biographer
–</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Anyway, I don’t think she’d care to have
this story spread all over Strand Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The public has a right to know these things.
If she’s a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her
feelings?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: If I promised not to write a word about it,
would you enlighten me? As your friend – as your valet –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Quiet. I’m trying to read a personal
message.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: A message?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is she saying?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Auf Wiedersehn.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Auf Weider—? The nerve!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: H’mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for
membership.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If only to have the distinct pleasure of
blackballing his brother.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Aren’t you going to finish your
breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes – I’m terribly sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where is it, Watson?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: In the files. May to July, 1885.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’re getting better.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Good morning, Watson. Just happened to be
in the neighborhood, and I thought –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What is it this time, Inspector
Lestrade?</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: We’ve had three rather nasty murders in
Whitechapel. All ladies of easy virtue. You may read something about it
– the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, I think I have.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Some of us at Scotland Yard were wondering
if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be willing to –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m sorry, Lestrade. But at the moment,
Holmes is working on another problem.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Oh… Well, I just thought it was the kind
of case that might interest him. I dare say we can solve it without his
help.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, I’m sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Good day, Lestrade.</p>
