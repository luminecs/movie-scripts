<p><strong>batman</strong>: This is all about fashion for you, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s the gear. Chicks love the gear.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Do call if you’re going to be late for
dinner, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Drive carefully, Master Wing.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Don’t wait up, AL.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Ten police cruisers frozen solid on the
Gotham Expressway . . .</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: … A giant drilling truck burrowing under the
city …</p>

<p><strong>robin</strong>: The batcomputer tracks him heading for the
Gotham Museum.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: The new antiquities exhibit. The Second Sun
of the Sudan.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Of course. He’s going to steal the giant
white diamond.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No, Robin. He’s going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: The Iceman Cometh.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Please. Show some mercy.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I’m afraid my condition has left me cold to
your pleas of mercy.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Copsicle.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: In this universe, there is only one
absolute. Everything…</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: …Freezes.</p>
<p><strong>18 the skylight - close. explodes.</strong>: Batman
free-falls into the room, hitting the brontosaurus and sliding down its
neck, SMASHING Freeze with his feet, the diamond sliding across the
frozen floor.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Bat on ice, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to play
with guns?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You’re not sending me to the cooler.</p>
<p><strong>22 the front doors - close. blow open</strong>: Robin, on the
Redbird, flies into the room.</p>

<p><strong>30a freeze</strong>: Cop-suey.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Caution. Bridge may ice over.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You get the ice. I’ll get the iceman.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I got mine. Where’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: What killed the dinosaurs? The ice age.</p>
<p><strong>46 robin</strong>: He’s definitely extinct.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Hit me boys.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Thanks for playing.</p>
<p><strong>58 batman</strong>: Round up the thugs. I’ll get Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. drilling truck - control capsule</strong>: A bank of
control panels are set inside the giant glass head of the drill. Batman
falls in to find Freeze standing at the main console.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Stop the insanity.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Nice of you to drop in.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You were a great scientist once. Don’t
squander your genius on evil.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I hate being lectured.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Watch the numbers, Batman. For they are the
harbingers of your doom.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Can you feel it coming? The icy cold of
space. At 30,000 feet your heart will freeze and beat no more.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: After you have frozen, your icy tomb will
plummet back to Gotham.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Freeze, you’re mad. This capsule will
slaughter thousands.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Ain’t it grand? Freeze well.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I was just hanging around.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I thought you were going to stay in the
museum and round up the thugs.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How about, nice to see you? Glad you’re here
to save my life.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: When we get home, we’re having a little
communication workshop.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is it cold in here or is it just me?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Got to make sure this rocket doesn’t turn
Gotham into a crater.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Now what? We call a taxi?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Watch the first step.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Surf’s up.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Cool. Can we do that again?</p>
<p><strong>103 batman</strong>: Sudden temperature drop. Watch out for
the…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Wind.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. boiler room</strong>: Frozen. At the terminus of the
tunnel. A frozen boiler stands in the center of the icy moat of the
building’s INTERNAL RESERVOIR. The door swings open, Batman pushing
inside.</p>
<p><strong>111 freeze</strong>: Can you be cold, Batman? You have eleven
minutes to thaw the bird. What will you do, chase the villain or save
the boy?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Your emotions make you weak. That is why
this day is mine. Stay cool, bats.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Did we get him?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I still have high hopes for the animal plant
cross-breedings</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: If I can only find the correct dose of
Venom, these plants will be able to fight back like animals. I will have
given flora a chance against the thoughtless ravages of man.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Personal note: my work would proceed faster
if Dr. Woodrue weren’t always whisking my Venom samples back to his
mysterious Gilgamesh Wing. Why won’t he let me into his lab?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What is he doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Dr. Isley, loveliest flower in our garden.
How fare our little wards?</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: What do we have here? A lovely new supply
of Venom. I’ll just take this to my laboratory for further study.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What exactly are you working on in there?
What are those screams?</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: How I’d love to share my secrets with you.
But I ask you, sweet sapling, can you be trusted? You refuse my
invitations to dine. You hide your honeyed buds behind these sallow
robes.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Ah, but there’s romance in the air tonight.
Perhaps a moonlit stroll in the jungle. And then, later, in the dark, we
can share everything.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: You have to tell me what you’re doing with
my Venom.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: You must show me your secrets, blossom,
before I show you mine.</p>
<p><strong>121 int. labs - gilgamesh section - walking</strong>: Pam
steals through the crumbling hallway of the abandoned prison following
the SCREAMS as they grow ever LOUDER.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. labs - gilgamesh chamber</strong>: Banks of flashing
SuperCrays. A gurney is surrounded by SPARKING and HUMMING equipment.
Frankestein meets Frankenstien.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the un-United
Nations. And our mystery bidder.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: I give you the future of military
conquest.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: May I present Antonio Diego, serial
murderer serving life in prison and sole surviving volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: And what a charmer he is.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: The super solder serum, code named Venom,
patent pending of course.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Notice the hassle free zipper.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Time to scream.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Behold, the ideal killing machine. I call
this little number…Bane. Bane of humanity. Imagine it, your own personal
army made up of thousands of these super soldiers. Bidding begins at a
mere 10 million.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Welcome to my parlor.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: …Our original sponsor had no stomach for
military applications. he cut the funding for our work -</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Our work?</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Without your research, I could never have
come this far. Join me. The two of us, entwined, side by side…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Join you? I’ve spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some
maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won’t be
able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you
psycho?</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Well, I can respect your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Sadly, I’m not good at rejection.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: I’m afraid you’ll have to die.</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Fellow maniacs, bidding begins!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Gotham University Labs. Security video. Two
years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dr. Victor Fries Two time Olympic
Decathelete. Nobel Prize winner in molecular biology. After his wife
contracted a rare disease, McGregor’s Syndrome, he hoped to freeze her
in cryogenic sleep until he could discover a cure. Here’s where
everything goes north.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That liquid is fifty below.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: That’s gotta hurt.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Somehow he survived. But the cryoslution
mutated his body.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: What happened to his wife?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Presumed dead. No one knows.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He needs extreme cold to survive. His
cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen,
disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic
super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern
here?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, if it’s ice the iceman
wants…Alfred!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I need the Wayne Diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Absolutely. Just as soon as you take ten
hours training in the simulator.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Whoa, I made a mistake. I’m sorry. Don’t go
all protective on me. It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dick, you were reckless. You could have been
killed.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I’m fine. See. Me. here. Alive. How are we
gonna work together if you’re never going to trust me?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: How, indeed?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: When did I become the bad guy?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’s over-eager, impulsive. I can’t trust him
not to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Perhaps the truth is you don’t really trust
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re on his side. Again.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Despite all your talents, you are still a
novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets
there by his own course. You must learn to trust him. For that is the
nature of family.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I trust you, Alfred.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: But I shan’t be here forever.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Good night, Master Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Override engaged. Copying protected
files.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Still unable to reach you. have vital
information you must see…</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Yes, sir, I’m so pleased you won the
bidding, Your Supreme Ruthlessness..</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: We’re making the final modifications on
Bane right now. We’ll have a thousand super soldiers out to you tomorrow
by overnight mail…</p>
<p><strong>woodrue</strong>: Dr. Isley? Pamela? You look great.
Especially for a dead woman.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Hello, Jason. I think I’ve had a change of
heart.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Quite literally. I don’t think I’m human
anymore. The animal-plant toxins had a rather unique effect on me. They
replaced my blood with aloe, my skin with chlorophyll and fill my lips
with Venom.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Oh, and Jason? One other thing. Silly me, I
probably should have mentioned this earlier. I’m poison. It’s a jungle
in here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Let the flames touch the sky. For I am
nature’s arm, her spirit, her will. Hell, I am mother nature. The time
has come for plants to take back the world so rightfully ours. Because
it’s not nice to fool with mother nature.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Coming, Bane darling. We’ve got a plane to
catch.</p>
<p><strong>ms. b. haven</strong>: Freezy, I’m feeling…hot.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I find that unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>ms. b. haven</strong>: Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is
dry and I don’t care. I’d weather blizzards to have you. You’re the most
perfect man I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: To be frozen. To never change. A life of
perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.</p>
<p><strong>ms. b. haven</strong>: What say we turn up the heat?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You’re skating on thin ice. My passion thaws
for my bride alone.</p>
<p><strong>ms. b. haven</strong>: Forget your frosty femme. These lips
are wet and ready to get frostbite.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Hop away little bunny. Before I cool your
jets. Permanently.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I wonder how cold I can get my
shower…Frosty!</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Everyone is always having a good time.
Except me. Try as I might, can find no pleasure. Perhaps my heart truly
has turned to ice.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Well, that was fun. There’s hope for me
yet.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Do you think I’m mad, Frosty?</p>
<p><strong>frosty</strong>: That’s really a judgment call, boss.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Battling the bat exhausted my power.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: But I was successful nevertheless.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: One more giant diamond of this size and my
freezing cannon will be complete. I will hold Gotham ransom. Unless the
city bows to my demands, it’s winter forever here in goat-town. The city
fathers will have no choice but to give me the billions I need to
complete my research, to find the cure for…</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Leave us. We need quality time.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Soon we will be together once more.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Nothing frustrates a man like a frigid
wife.</p>
<p><strong>154 batman</strong>: We’ll be starting again now.</p>
<p><strong>156 batman</strong>: Pause virtual reality simulation.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I got the diamond. Quell problemo, Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You left your back wide open. Freeze could
have killed you.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I had it covered.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You know, in the circus, The Flying Graysons
were a team. We had to trust each other. We had to count on each person
to do his part. That’s what being partners is all about. End
simulation.</p>
<p><strong>160 dick</strong>: Sometimes counting on someone else is the
only way to win.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Where’s Al?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Couldn’t we just for once pretend that I’m
the teacher and you’re the student?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I must have dozed off. My sincerest
apologies, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: No apology necessary. That’s the first time
in thirty years.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Mystery pizza delivery?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Please be looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m so sorry to trouble you, but-</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Uncle Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>bruce &amp; dick</strong>: Uncle?</p>
<p><strong>165 ext. wayne estate gardens - afternoon - walking</strong>:
Bruce, Alfred, Dick, and Barbara tour.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Ten years. Barbara isn’t really me niece,
sir. She’s Joanna Clark’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Of course. Alfred still keeps your mother’s
picture in his room.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap
seats who Joanna Clark is?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Joanna and I were in love in London. But
when I realized our age difference was too extreme -</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Uncle Alfred left for America. Much to my
mother’s dismay -</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Eventually she married a young
physician.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Al’s main squeeze. Is she here? I’m about to
scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: My parents were killed in an auto accident
ten years ago. Alfred has been supporting me ever since.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You have?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this
house, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m on break from-</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Oxbridge Academy?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Their new computer sciences division. How
did you know?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I recognized the accent.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What is it? It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: You certainly will not.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh no, those things frighten me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, I hope you’ll stay with us.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: There’s a lovely inn just down –</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: All this luxury really isn’t my style but-
I’d love to stay.</p>
<p><strong>brue</strong>: Then it’s settled.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Oh, but, sir. So much goes on-</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Don’t be silly, Alfred. After all, she’s
family.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Be gentle. He’s always been touchy.</p>
<p><strong>handler</strong>: Whatever you say, lady.</p>
<p><strong>handler</strong>: He’s always been touchy. Right.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: There must be some mistake –</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Silly darling, there’s no need to pretend in
front of the driver.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Love hurts. In my case it kills.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Once around the park.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I didn’t know sneaking around was on the
curriculum at Oxbridge.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.
And…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: You came to tuck me in. That’s quite a
switch. I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the
Maharajah of Mirajanpore. But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it
travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I guess they don’t have fax machines on
elephants.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no
success. As one grows older, one yearns for family.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: It’s good to see you again, Uncle. I’ve
missed you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: As I’ve missed you. Sleep well, child.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Maybe this time, this new formula, will
return you to me.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: No cure tonight, my love. Forgive me. But
soon, I promise you. Soon.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Kind of Hip, kind of Wow, Ivy. Kind of Free,
kind of Now, Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: My father once told me that to succeed we
need only pick our star and follow it. And so Wayne Enterprises is
donating the world’s most advanced telescope to Gotham’s Observatory
Restoration Project. Perhaps this telescope will give future generations
a chance to find their own stars.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: Brucy, is it true this new telescope
can see all around the globe?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Yes, if you’ll watch the monitors -</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Satellites already in orbit allow us to
reflect light around the planet.</p>
<p><strong>associate</strong>: From here we’ll be able to see the sky
anywhere on earth.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Just don’t point it at my bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: Brucy, you and the exquisite Julie
Madison have been going out forever. Are you planning to tie the
knot?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Get married? me? No…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No!?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Umm. What I mean is…no plans at the
moment…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But soon…</p>
<p><strong>gerty</strong>: Soon?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Ah…Sooner or later…all relationships evolve
and…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Can I get some help over here?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Bruce and I are lucky enough to be recklessly
in love. And that is most certainly enough for us. For now.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Now, if you’ll all follow me, I’ll show
you the central control grid…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Mr. Wayne?</p>
<p><strong>190 wider</strong>: Pam, hair in a bun, face behind glasses,
cloaked in a frumpy suit, is standing behind two door GUARDS.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: She doesn’t have a pass, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: They’re overly protective. You’re Not going
to hurt me are you, Ms…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Dr. Pamela Isley.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What can I do for you, Doctor? A research
grant? A hospital wing?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Actually, I already work for you. Or did.
Your arboreal preservation project in South America.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: We cut our support. A conflict of ideologies.
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I see you knew him.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: That lab was consumed by fire last week. how
did you manage to escape?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I have here a proposal showing how Wayne
Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our
environment.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Forget the stars. Look here, at the Earth,
our mother, our womb. She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet
you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You’re
killing her.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel
for heat. No coolants to preserve food. Millions would die of cold and
hunger alone.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Acceptable losses in a battle to save the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: People come first, Dr. Isley.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Mammals. So smug in your towers of stone and
glass. A day of reckoning is coming. The same plants and flowers that
saw you crawl blind from the primordial soup will reclaim this planet.
Earth will be a garden again. Somehow, some way, I will bring your
man-made civilization to its knees and there will be no one to protect
you.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: You must be new in town. In Gotham
City, Batman and Robin protect us. Even from plants and flowers.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Perhaps you’d like to meet them.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: The caped crusaders are helping us auction
off a prized diamond to raise money for the Gotham Botanical Gardens.
Just a few mammals doing what we can for our world’s plants.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: So, Brucy, will the delicious
Ms. Madison be your date for the flower ball tonight?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster
to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the
event, sadly I will be unable to attend. Thank you all. Good day,
Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Batman and Robin. Militant arm of the
warm-blooded oppressors. Animal protectors of the status quo. First I’ll
rid myself of the fur and feathered pests. And then Gotham will be mine
for the greening.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Oh, Victor, it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>frosty</strong>: ’Scuse me, chief. I got something her you
might want to see.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I hate it when people talk during the
movie.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: One more diamond, my love. One more.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You think Freeze will take the bait?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: He’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen. Gossip Gerty of Good
Morning Gotham and I welcome you to the gem of our evening.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: The famed Heart of Isis, on loan from
the Collection of my close, personal friend Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: Tonight, on auction, an opportunity to dine with
one of our fabulous flowers, the famed diamond draped around her
neck.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: Ooo, look at all these luscious
lovelies. let’s start the bidding.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Ten thousand for Chrysanthemum.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: Twenty thousand for Lilac.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Thirty thousand for Rose.</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: Boys, please. Show some gusto.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Gorilla my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>mc</strong>: And you are…</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Poison. Poison Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why not send junior to bed early, I could come
and take your measurements?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: On the other hand, youth does have its
advantages. Endurance. Stamina.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Why settle for second place? Robin is a
sidekick, a junior partner. If we were a team, you’d be the star. Forget
the geriatric bat. Come, join me, my garden needs tending.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’ll take it from here, pal.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Some lucky boy’s about to hit the honey pot.
I’ll include an evening of my company for the winner. I’ll bring
everything you see here. Plus everything you don’t. And I’ll bring my
imagination.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: 50 thousand for Poison Ivy - -</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: 100 thousand for Poison Ivy - -</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: One million - -</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You own it. Two million - -</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You don’t have two million. Three million -
-</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’ll borrow it from you. Four million - -</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You two boys aren’t going to fight over little
old me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Five million - -</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Six million - -</p>
<p><strong>gossip gerty</strong>: Is it getting nippy in here?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Did I use the wrong door again?</p>
<p><strong>215b freeze</strong>: When technology fails…brute force.</p>
<p><strong>215d freeze</strong>: Alright, everyone, chill!</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I should have been a decorator.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady?
Ms. Moss?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even
though silver went out in the 70’s. But those boots are unforgivable.
What is it with men?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I’d love to stand here all day and exchange
fashion tips but I’m kind of pressed for time. So hand over the diamond,
Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Pheromone dust. Designed to heat a man’s
blood. Doesn’t work on the cold hearted. Now, if you please…</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Well, if you insist.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Clever little clover.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: That’s my exit cue.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You have eleven minutes to thaw those
guests, Commissioner.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Miss Ivy, you’ve just met one of the most
sinister men in Gotham.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: That’s no man. That’s a God!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Enough monkey business. We’ve got work to
do.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Pull back. You can’t make the jump.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can make it.</p>
<p><strong>238 batman</strong>: Pull back.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can make it.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Redbird control codes.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Disable engine.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: It’s a cold town.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I’m putting you on ice.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I could have made the jump.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You could have splattered your brains on the
side of the building.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: This is no partnership. You’re never going to
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Trust you? You can’t even keep your head on
the job. All you could think about was Poison Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You just can’t stand that she might have
wanted me instead of you; that’s your idea of friendship, isn’t it,
Bruce? You have to have everything. Your house. Your rules. Your way or
the highway. It’s Batman and Robin not Robin and Batman. I’m sick of
it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes it’s my rules. My rules that keep us
alive. And if you want to stay in this house and on this team then
you’ll abide by them.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I have tried every address I know for you. I
am praying this reaches you. We have very little time.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Congratulations on your apprehension of
Mr. Freeze. Batman monopolized the evening news.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Is there something wrong, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred, am I pigheaded? Is it always my way
or the highway?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Why, yes, actually. Death and chance stole
your parents. But rather than become a victim, you have done everything
in your power to control the fates. For what is Batman if not an effort
to master the chaos that sweeps our world, an attempt to control death
itself.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: But I can’t can I?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: No, my boy. I’m afraid none of us can.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh. I’m so sorry. I’d just never seen
anything like it. So massive. I took it out for a spin. I do so hope I
didn’t inconvenience you. Ah yes, the outfit. For a…costume party. Just
trying it out. One never knows how leather will wear. Judo lessons at
school, you know. All the rage, really. I suppose they’ve taken better
than I thought. Again, my greatest of pardons.</p>
<p><strong>head guard</strong>: You’re the common cold. And we’re the
cure. Welcome home, frost face.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Allow me to break the ice. My name is
Freeze. Learn it well for it is the chilling sound of your doom.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Look at him stew. How do you like your bad
guy, medium or well done?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Get used to it. You’re gonna be here a
very long time.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I’m afraid not. You see the means of my
liberation is in your hands. Sadly, you will not live to see it.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Batface and Birdbrain turned out to be more
resistant to my love dust than expected. No matter, I’ll give them a
stronger dose. Next time, they’ll literally be dying for me.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: A fixer-upper, yes. But with a certain homey
charm.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Ah, a minus. Current tenants.</p>
<p><strong>golum</strong>: Hello, pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Hello yourself. I love this place. I hope it’s
priced to sell.</p>
<p><strong>golum</strong>: We love you. You look good enough to eat.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Oh, that I am. Come and get me. If you can.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: For the strong, silent type, you are most
persuasive. Let’s redecorate. First, the light is all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Also, what is this floor?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Au natural. Still, I’ve always hankered for
something on the water.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Now a little color. It took God seven days to
create paradise.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Let’s see if I can do better.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Bane, I’ve found a fellow who strikes my fancy.
A cool customer, yes. Icy demeanor, no question. But I detect a certain
ruthless charm I may be able to use to my advantage.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re not even listening to me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What? I’m sorry. You were saying…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We’ve been going out over a year now
and…Okay, here goes. Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Julie, I’m not the marrying kind. There are
things about me you wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know you’re a dedicated bachelor. That
you’ve had a your wild nights.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Wild doesn’t exactly cover it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But there’s nothing you’ve done under the
cover of darkness I couldn’t learn to understand.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I wouldn’t bet on that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m betting on you. You’ll make someone a
good husband one day. But I can’t wait around forever. Don’t answer now.
Just think it over. Here’s some food for thought.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Who’s Ivy?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You just called me Ivy. Who’s Ivy?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Enhance detail, 14 to 19.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Alert! Unauthorized motion within
specified parameters.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Got ya!</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What’s the entry fee?</p>
<p><strong>banker</strong>: Two-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You got a handle?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Folks call me Three-Jump.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You’re the babe won the tunnel run two nights
ago. That was trike racing. This is the big time. Maybe you should ride
my hog instead.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: How about a side bet?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Crazy broad.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: So, this is where you hang out.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I could have made it, you know. I didn’t
need your help.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Whatever you say, lady. It’s all in a day’s
work for me.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: This is to replace the bike I lost. I’ll
get you the rest.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Keep it.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the
fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred
dollars?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hey, what’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I guess, the truth is I’m just not
comfortable with the idle rich. Even when they try to act like
heroes.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Well you better get comfortable real fast,
sister. Cause we’ve only got one bike and it’s a long walk home.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I started racing after my parents died.
There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of
myself, that made the hurt go away. You wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You’d be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Street racing isn’t exactly an acceptable
major at Oxbridge. They kicked me out. it doesn’t matter. I’ve won
enough money to do what I’ve always dreamed.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Just don’t tell me you’re hoping to run away
and join the circus.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Alfred has supported me my whole life. Now
I’m going to pay him back. I’m going to liberate him from his dismal
life of servitude.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Servants, Masters, it’s ridiculous. Alfred
is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he’s subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Alfred and Bruce are like family.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Paying someone to prepare your meals and do
your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Alfred’s happy here.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Happy. You honestly don’t know, do you? You
can’t even see what’s in front of your own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Look at his skin. At how he’s hiding the
pain all the time. Can’t you see it? Alfred’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred�s not sick.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: He’s dying. And I can’t deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: But he’s never said a word-</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You know Alfred. He’d never say Anything. But
I can tell. Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.
Without him, I don’t know how I would have survived. He saved my life,
Dick. And I’ve never told him.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Talk to him, Bruce. There’s nothing worse than
losing someone without telling them how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m scared, Dick. Maybe for the first time in
my life. I’m really scared.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey Icehead, you got a visitor.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Your sister’s here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Sister?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Don’t mind us, ma’am. You can converse
freely.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Oh, I don’t mind you at all.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: You’re not that attractive. Pretty average
I’d say. But your fantasies aren’t average, are they?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Men. The most absurd of all God�s creatures. We
give you life and we can take it back just as easily.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: What if I told you one kiss from me would kill
you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Right</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I really am to die for.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Impressive</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have
been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing. So I’m here to set
you free.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: An enticing offer. But what does the lady
want in return?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Let’s cool it for now. There’s someone I want
you to meet.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Ah, a laundry service that delivers.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty
Big and Tall?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I always go a size smaller. Makes me look
slimmer.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: They’ve confiscated my generator diamonds.
I’m running on empty.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: No gun. How disarming.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the
gardens?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Dear daisy, don’t despair.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Always winterize your pipes.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I hate heights.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You’ll hate prison more.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Are you well, old friend?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I am as well as can be expected.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred, I know you’re sick – I can get you
the best doctors.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I’ve seen the best doctors–! A gentleman
does not discuss his health. It’s not civilized. I hope I’ve taught you
at least that much, young man.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Have you ever regretted your life working
here, Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret
is that I was never able to be out there with you.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Not all heroes wear masks.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred, if I’ve never told you…I just want to
say…</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>342b back to scene</strong>: DICK Freeze has escaped.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: My reserves are exhausted. I must have the
gems that power my suit.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You are looking unseasonably hot. Let’s go
inside and grab your rocks.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: In my weakened state I am no match for the
bat and the bird.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You leave Batman and Robin to me.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Trust me. Vegetable magnetism.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Fine. While I retrieve my diamonds, you and
meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair. She’s frozen in -</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Hold it. You never said anything about a wife,
frozen or otherwise-</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You will rescue my wife</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: OK, OK. Ms. Ivy to the rescue. Now where do I
find your brittle bride?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: There’s no sign he came back here after the
escape. We pulled this off the surveillance cameras at Arkham.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: She’s definitely part of this. It’s weird,
for a while Ivy was all I could think about. But then…</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I know. The feeling just vanished.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t believe we were fighting over a bad
guy.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Bad, yes. Guy, no. This is one majorly
beautiful evil person.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m totally over her. Positively.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Me too. Great stems, though.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Umm-hmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How did you…?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Open Sesame…Chicken.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: She’s still alive. He’s adapted his freezing
technology to reverse McGregor’s Syndrome. He’s even found a cure for
the early stages of the disease.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Can he save her?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No. Her case is too advanced. But maybe,
someday, with more research-</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No beauty…</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Just the beast.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ouch. Anymore at home like you?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I hate uninvited guests.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I must confess, the combination of heroic
daring-do and an anatomically correct rubber suit puts fire in a
girl’s…lips.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Why do all the gorgeous ones have to be
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Why don’t you boys slip into something more
comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Her pretty birdie.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Give it up. If you threw yourself-</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: At you? Polly want a kiss?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I must be losing my touch.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Stick around.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You bring out the animal in me.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I should have brought my leash.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Enough sweet talk.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You’re going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m a lover not a fighter. That’s why every
Poison Ivy action figure comes complete with…him.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m off to find Bachelor Number Two. Try not to
make a mess when you die.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Ahh. Chilled to perfection.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Superman, eat your heart out.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: All right coppers, Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Stop living in the shadow of the big bad bat.
You don’t need him. You deserve your own legend. Your own bright shining
signal in the sky. Let me guide you. Let me… …Touch you. Kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins
introduced through the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I’m
betting her lips are poison.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: A poison kiss? You have some real issues with
women, you know that? You just couldn’t stand that she was about to kiss
me. Couldn’t stand that something might be mine and not yours. Could
you?!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Ivy’s right. I don’t need you. I’m going
solo. I want my own signal in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: What happened? How’d they get away?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: So sorry, Ms. Fridigaire. I’m just not good
with competition.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Make yourself right at home.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Where is my wife?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: There was nothing I could do. Batman
deactivated her. She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You lie!</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Their bones will turn to ice. Their blood
will freeze in my hands.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why
should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them
goes unpunished?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Yes. I shall replay the world for sentencing
me to a life without the warmth of human comfort. I will blanket the
city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Just what I had in mind. Everything dead on
Earth except us. A chance for mother nature to start again. Plants and
flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless
against man. Sorry hon, this is for science. Behold the dawn of a new
age.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I have created a race of plants with the
strength of the deadliest animals. Once you have frozen mankind, my
mutants will overrun the globe. The Earth will become a brave new world
of only plants. And we shall rule them. For we will be the only two
people left in the world.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Adam and Evil.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: You will distract the bat and bird while I
prepare to freeze Gotham.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Can’t we just ice them along with the rest of
the citizenry?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: That is far too merciful. Batman will watch
his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.
But the Robin is young. Impetuous. If I could get him alone-</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: One kiss and you could lift the mask from
his lifeless face. Their secret identities would be revealed. But how
best to bait a brid?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: The way to a boy’s heart is through his ego.
What strapping young hero could resist his very own…signal?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Inspired, Ms. Ivy.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m hungry. I think I’ll have poultry.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s Stage One of McGregor’s Syndrome. I’m
sorry. All we can do is make him comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’ve spent my whole life trying to beat back
death. What good are all my heroics now if I can’t save you?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Everyone dies, Master Bruce. There’s no
defeat in that. Victory comes in fighting for what we know is right
while we still live.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I love you, old man.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Remember this. And remember it always. I’m
proud of you. And I love you too, son.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: McGregor’s Syndrome. That’s what Freeze’s wife
had.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes. But Alfred’s condition is less severe.
Freeze’s research says he cured a case like Alfred’s. It just doesn’t
say how.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I checked the medical database. No one else is
even close.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m late for the dedication. Then I go after
Freeze and Ivy. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Like hell you do.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dick, don’t push me right now.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Or what? No one can capture Ivy but the big
bad Bat. Crap! You just want her for yourself. Don’t you? Answer me,
damn it!</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Yes! Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.
That’s the whole point. Look at us. Orphans. Isolated. Obsessed to the
exclusion of life, love, family. We’re perfect targets. She’s done
something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here’s what
I know, she loves me, Not you and it’s driving you crazy. It’s why you
stopped us from kissing. Because if you can’t have her, nobody can.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’s clouded your mind. You’re not thinking
straight.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Oh but I am. For the first time in a long
time. I’m through living in your shadow. All that ends right now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve been ringing forever. Where’s
Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m sorry. I was too late.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Too late for what, dear child?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I came to give you your freedom, a chance
to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I have been part of the greatest adventure
ever know. I have found purpose here, and the family I could never
have.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: You must do something for me.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Find my brother Wilfred. Give him This. I
have duties he must fulfill in my stead. Only family can be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: It is the hearts of two good men whom I have
had the honor of calling son. Take it, child. But I implore you, never
open it. You look so like your mother.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Uncle Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ve always wondered, where does that big old
bat light come from?</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: It’s on top of police headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’d just love to see it. But you probably
don’t have access.</p>
<p><strong>gordon</strong>: Why, I’m Commissioner of Police. I have the
keys right here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: On second thought, you’re way too old for
me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Dr. Isley. it was like I could feel you in
the room. You’re…enchanting. Gorgeous. The most beautiful woman I’ve
ever seen. If you’re..um… free…this evening.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Bruce? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I think he’s asking me on a date, in an
awkward, stammering sort of way.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve heard of commitment anxiety, but this is
insane. You’re not really propositioning another woman right in front of
me. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well, define ‘propositioning’.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Make a choice, Bruce. Her or me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Well…um…her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You were right. I get it. You’re not the
marrying kind. You’ve made your point. Goodbye Bruce Wayne.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed
over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I can’t. But perhaps tonight, over
dinner…I’ve just had an opening.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Maybe your witless playboy persona works on
every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your
attentions. So back off or I’ll have you in court quicker than you can
spell sexual harassment. Got me?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Does that mean dinner’s a no?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s just I sort of…kind of …love you.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Bundle up boys. There’s a storm coming.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Let there be light.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Only family can be trusted?</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Access denied. Protected files.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Perhaps you didn�t give me your genes. But
you gave me your heart.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred, old friend, I could use your help
right now.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Right here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: I anticipated a moment might arrive where I
became…incapacitated. As such, I programmed my brain algorithms into the
batcomputer and created a virtual simulation.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: It’s good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Women.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: That, sir, does not compute.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both
Dick and me. Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Specify, please.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Pamela Isley. I was so attracted to her I
couldn’t reason clearly. I still can’t. She used to work for Wayne
Enterprises. Find a file.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Coming on line now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What was her area of research?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Advanced botany. DNA splicing. Recombinant
animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Pheromones?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Glandular secretions from animals. Scents
that create powerful emotions. Fear. Rage…</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Passion. Of course. Find the photo of Ivy
after the flower ball.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Deconstruct and resolve.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Amazing what a good wig and contact lenses
can do. And I thought Clark Kent got away with murder just wearing those
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the
batsignal.</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: Access code accepted.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: This better be one hell of a secret.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: No matter what they tell you, it’s the size
of your gun that counts.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: That’s no batlight, it’s a birdcall.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Her name is Pamela Isley. I saw her talking
to Gordon. She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: And she did it all for me. For love.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She’s infected us with some kind of pheromone
extract-</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Is that it, Bruce? I’m under some magic
spell?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: She wants to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You’d say anything to keep me away from her.
To keep her for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You once said to me that being part of a team
means trusting your partner. That sometimes counting on someone else is
the only way to win. DO you remember?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You weren’t just talking about being
partners. You were talking about being a family. Well, part of our
family is dying. I’m not going to lose everyone I’ve ever loved. So I’m
asking you now, friend, partner, brother - will you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Hi. Sorry about the door. Is the party
over?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Who the hell is this nutball?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: That’s Mr. Nutball to you. Half a set of
bookends. You. Go like this.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: No. move your hands up. Higher. Now a hint
more fear. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: A matched pair. Sometimes I exceed even my
wildest expectations.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: If revenge is a dish best served cold, then
put on your Sunday finest. It’s time to feast.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Uncle Alfred?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: In spirit only, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: The boys need help.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Your mother would be proud.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Forgive my being personal, dear girl, but I
must know your size.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is your thumb the only part of you that’s
green?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You’ll just have to find out.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Big family? Like pets? Don’t talk much, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: I’m glad you came. I can’t breathe without
you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I want us to be together. But I need to know
you’re serious about turning over a new leaf. I need a sign.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: How about dangerous curves?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Of trust. Tell me your plan.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Kiss me and I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Tell me and I’ll kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Freeze has turned the new telescope into a
freezing gun. He’s about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’ve got to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: One kiss, my love. For luck.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Bad luck, I’m afraid. It’s time to die, little
bird.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.
These lips can be murder.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Then you never loved me?</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your
animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss
is sucking the life from your ape-like face.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m not saying I told you so.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: You’re too late. Say bye-bye birdie.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Sorry to disappoint you. But rubber lips are
immune to your charms.</p>
<p><strong>428a batman</strong>: Robin and I found the cure to your evil
spell. And that’s teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Sorry, boys, my vines have a little crush on
you.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Gotta run. So many people to kill. So little
time.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: You’re about to become compost.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Using feminine wiles to get what you want.
Trading on your looks. Exploiting men’s weakness for sex. Read a book,
sister. That passive- aggressive crap went out in the seventies. Chicks
like you give women a bad name.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: As I told Lady Freeze when I pulled her plug,
this is a one woman show.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>438a batman</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Batgirl.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: That’s not awfully PC. How about Batwoman?
Batperson?</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: It’s me. Barbara. I found the cave.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We gotta get those locks changed.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: She knows who we are.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I guess we’ll just have to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Kill her later. We’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: 1-Adam 12, 1-Adam-12, see the mad scientist
with the freezing ray.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Cops on the rocks, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Police are so hot tempered these days. Don’t
you agree, Mr. Bane?</p>
<p><strong>453 freeze</strong>: Ivy failed to unmask the Dynamic Duo. No
matter, the Bat and Bird are mine at last. Watch, Batman, as your
beloved Gotham freezes. And prepare to die. Because you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: The Bat-allion approaches. Icemen.
Attack.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Attack plan alpha.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Alpha. Roger.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Alpha. Got it. What the hell is attack plan
Alpha?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Divide and conquer.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Tack.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Boy, I hope Freeze hires these guys by the
dozen.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Nice extras package.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: That’s what I call a close shave.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Don’t sink and drive.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Not so fast. Time you cooled your heals.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Youwsa! Nothing but air.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Batgirl, Baatgirl, Baatgirl.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Mr. Bane, I’ll finish off the city. You, as
they say in showbiz, are on. Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring
me the Bat.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And
thaw the city.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: This is easy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Crimefighter’s rule number one: never say
that.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>494 robin</strong>: That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Does this mean we’re going steady?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Let’s do this the old-fashioned way.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Crimefighter’s rule number two.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: I’m afraid to ask.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Be ready for anything.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Pow! What! Kazow!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What exactly are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: I don’t know. It just feels right.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: No sign of the snowman.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Maybe he melted.</p>
<p><strong>513a batgirl</strong>: I hope you’ve got about ten million
more of those little toys.</p>
<p><strong>515 robin</strong>: Eight more minutes and a city full of
Gothamites are ice cubes forever.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Sunlight could reverse the freezing
process.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Sunrise isn’t for five hours.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: But it’s morning in the Congo.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: If we could relay the sunlight-</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: From the other side of the equator-</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: It’ll take the satellites about a minute to
re-align, but…damn!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Damn? Damn is not good.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun
beam won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I’ll set the telescope. You two thaw the
mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: I love this belt. Can I get a matching
handbag?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Who ever thought Aunt Harriet’s typing
lessons would lead to this?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Tonight’s forecast… …a freeze is coming!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Millions will die so you can save on air
conditioning. Isn’t that taking self help a little too far?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: We aim to… …Freeze.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: That’s new. Let’s swing.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: This just isn’t my day.</p>
<p><strong>551b associate</strong>: Up, up and away.</p>
<p><strong>551d scientist</strong>: PhDs rule!</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You’ve turned Gotham to ice. You’ve
endangered countless lives. It’s payback time.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>561 batgirl</strong>: No. I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wow. Batman.</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: I’ve seen you on TV.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Nice to meet you. Can you give me any more
height on this thing?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Going up.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: You’re loosing your cool</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: I think not. There’ll be no hot time in this
old town tonight. You’ll get a charge out of this.</p>
<p><strong>575a robin</strong>: Now that’s what I call an exit.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Please tell me he’s on our side.</p>
<p><strong>580b batgirl</strong>: Don’t worry. I’ve got him.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No. I’ve got him.</p>
<p><strong>580e robin</strong>: You should get that suit taken in. No
one’s buying baggy anymore.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Grab my belt and hang on.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: This is your stop.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Winded, old timer?</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Don’t make me kill you in front of the
girl.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: It’s midnight. The telescope’s gone.
There’s no way to thaw the city.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Theoretically, the satellites could be
positioned to thaw the city directly. But it would take a computer
genius.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: No. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>batgirl</strong>: Ms. Genius. Madame Genius. Her Geniusness.
Which sounds better?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Go on, kill me too. Just as you killed my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: I didn’t kill your wife.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: Run Ivy evidence tape 001.40.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: As I told Lady Freeze when I pulled her plug,
this is a one woman show.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: But she’s not dead, Victor. We found her,
restored her icy slumber.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: She’s still frozen, Victor, alive, waiting
for you to find a cure. I know what it’s like to lose everything you’ve
ever loved. But vengeance isn’t power. Any two-bit thug with a gun can
take a life. To give life, that’s true power, a power you once had. I
don’t know if you’ll ever find a cure for your wife. But I’m asking you
now, Doctor Victor Fries, to save another life. Show me how to cure
McGregor’s Syndrome Stage One. And maybe you can also save the man your
wife once loved. He’s still inside you, buried somewhere deep beneath
the snow. Will you help me? Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Take two of these and call me in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>batman</strong>: All we can do now is wait. And hope.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: He loves me. He loves me not. He loves me. he
loves me…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: It’s amazing what you can buy around here
for a few dozen diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>freeze</strong>: Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has
come at last.</p>
<p><strong>ivy</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Alfred, are you…?</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught
you proper housekeeping. And quite well, it seems. Thanks to you, son.
Thanks to you all.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: One question. When Batgirl and I rolled off
the telescope, how come you didn’t try and save us? It was the first
time I fell and you weren’t there to catch me.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I knew you could handle it.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: Sometimes counting on someone else is the
only way to win.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hey, I’m the one who kicked Ivy’s botanical
butt. Personally. Me. I did.</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: You are going back to school.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You’re never going to win this argument,
Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Partners?</p>
<p><strong>bruce &amp; dick</strong>: Partners.</p>
<p><strong>alfred</strong>: We’re going to need a bigger cave.</p>
