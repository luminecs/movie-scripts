<h1 id="the-salton-sea">the-salton-sea</h1>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My name is Tom Van Allen … or Danny Flynne
…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Methedrene was first distilled by a Japanese
scientist before WWII. Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a good thing
when they saw it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This guy’s so tweaked, he probably thinks he
can survive this without a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Maybe not. By some estimates, 2% of the
Japanese population had a meth problem after the war: factory workers,
soldiers, pilots. Maybe that’s why it took two bombs to get ’em to
surrender. A nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined
tweaker.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: In the fifties, the housewives got ahold of
it. Dexedrine. Benzedrine. Methedrene …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There were even rumors that one of our
presidents dabbled with mysterious “energy shots”. Imagine that: a
slammer in the White House.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: By the late 60’s the government finally
cracked down and sent the whole thing underground. Bikers controlled the
market for a while.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and
the right ingredients can cook it up at home.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak buying
up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid, match heads
for red phosphorus, ether and of course the cold medicine .. that’s for
Ephedrene, soon to become Methedrene</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It ain’t right</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Something’s off.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: We can do better.</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: So the alphabet, I mean look at it, there’s 26
letters. Why not 27 or 28 or 106? And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u. What
the hell is up with that?</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: And sometimes y.</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: What I’m saying is that I love it! It’s great.
I could go on all night about it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And so this is where I find myself. No. I
should choose my words more wisely: this is the world I sought out. The
land of the perpetual night- party. Day swallowing night and night
swallowing day. The crank compressing time like some divine piston on
its awesome downstroke.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How the hell did we get this detail?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Guess it’s our turn.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Twelve</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Midnight?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I know a guy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Lead the way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nice day</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I hadn’t noticed. I’ve seen you around.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jimmy. Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: My features. They’re Finnish.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Finland is a country.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, Jimmy the Finn, let’s go score some
gack.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: The spiders.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Aha! Yeah! You thought you could fuck with
Bobby, you thought you could fuck with Bobby, you thought you could fuck
with Bobby!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s me … Jimmy</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with
Simmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Um, coupla’ eight balls oughta do us.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Don’t pay her no mind.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey man, take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on. Ease off the girl.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Did you bring the plastic men?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Did … you … bring … the … plastic … men?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nah, we didn’t bring ’em. That’s just your
good crank talking, brother.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You bring the plastic men?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. Rhymes with …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hobby?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s a good man. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got going with
your old lay, it’s none of our business. We’re just a couple of dope
fiends trying to score.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Two eight balls?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh … that. Ah, he was just juiced. He
wouldn’t have did nothin’</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: C.I. number 678-43K-107 Tanner and
Garcetti</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ve got a hot one.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You go, boy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If it’s all the same to you, I’d rather not
dish right here in the middle of Crankville.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, you know what they say, just because
you’re paranoid, doesn’t mean everyone’s not out to slice your balls off
and shove ’em down your throat.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bobby, rhymes with hobby.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse
tatts.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No last name?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It was all pretty informal. Didn’t have a lot
of time to exchange pleasantries.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: This the guy?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It speaks!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s him. He’s a lot prettier in person
though.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic
men - the whole nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: What’s he holding?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Couple of eightballs, maybe more.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Any company?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Alas, the lovely Mrs. Bobby was playing the
bologna in a Posturpedic sandwich And there was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: A kid? Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah … he had a spear
gun, too.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: God damn, Flynne, you are one observant
tweaker.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Danny, I’m touched.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t be. I’m worried about the kid.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Then why didn’t you help the kid when you
were there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey, you want me to do all your work for you,
numbnuts?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: I’ll tell you why you didn’t help -
because you’re a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You’re a bottom feader,
Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Garcetti, you’re teeth, they’re fucking
perfect.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Let me help you with those.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I was rude. I’m sorry. I’m kinda new around
here.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You did the right thing. What is this stuff
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Fermented soybean curd.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yummy.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My name is Tom Van Allen I play the
trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That’s so …</p>
<p><strong>danny / tom</strong>: Melancholy?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Yes, it hurts my heart. What a beautiful
composition.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: And the performance?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing
short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis’ haunting, moody
piece.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: And he has a really hot ass with hardly any
hair on it.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Again, I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I was talking about Miles.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: You, madam, are a heartless wench.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: And you’ve got wiener breath.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: It’s that disgusting hot dog you had for
lunch.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Tom! Gross!</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: You know how I make that song melancholy
when I play it? I think of what my life would be like without you.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Tom, let’s spend the night here.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: There’s no motels around here.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let’s do
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay, we’ll stay. We’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Come on, Liz. We’ll get eaten alive.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No … We’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You think I’m a Judas?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Hard to compare the people you’re taking
down with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Garcetti thinks I’m a pile of shit.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He
doesn’t even like dolphins.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Thanks for not judging me.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: It’s not my place.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t you wonder why I do it?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out
of jail? I know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t find that repugnant?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Just the way the world works. Look, as far
as tweakers go, you aren’t a bad guy. You never hurt anyone but yourself
as far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tell that to Bobby … and his wife and
kid.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Bobby laid his own tracks. He could have
gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as
I’m concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without
him. Now take the money.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s a long story. Maybe I’ll tell you all
about it some day.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I was getting to it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: I’ll tell him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Danny, it’s really pains me to have to
tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us
put away for trafficking a few months back?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. What about him?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Turns out he’s connected.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: The Mexicali Boys</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: And what does this have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: He knows somebody ratted him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: And he’s making a lot of noise about
having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Shut up, Garcetti!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If he finds out it’s me, I’m a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Danny, he isn’t gonna find out it’s you.
Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different
people.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How the hell am I gonna do that? You guys are
still stringing me a long on that possession charge.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: You mean that hasn’t been cleared up
yet?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost
a year. I’ve done everything you guys have asked of me.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Anyone ever ask you to be such a
disrespectful smart-ass all the time?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Look, we’ll talk to the A.D.A.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Soon. I promise. We’ll get the charges
dropped and you can disappear. In the mean time, trust me, he has no
idea that you ratted him out.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You like that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who wouldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: First rate, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s downright classy is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Get in, hoss. We’ll talk it over.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jimmy, you don’t look so hot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m hurting.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You on a roll?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Was. I’m on the fucking ghost train right
now, man. You got anything for me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why does it have to feel so bad?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re brain is in reverse mode … cutting off
your supply of dopamine. Here. Have a beer.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh yeah. Man, Danny, how do you keep your
shit together so tight?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m serious, dude. You always seem to be on
top of things, even when you’re tweakin’.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I guess there’s just no substitute for good
genes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, it’s a pity. Truly a pity.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I kind of doubt it, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So, why’d you want to see me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Business. I need to leave town and I find
myself in dire need of some cash.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: See that? That’s just what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You. You’re smooth. You use words like dire
and shit. You got language skills, man.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t get carried away.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I find myself in dire need of some cash.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You remember that guy you told me about …
said he could handle a big hook-up?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, Pooh-Bear. Dude is a big-time cook. I’m
talking dire.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I know a buyer. Guy’s looking for a quarter’s
worth.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: A quarter? Danny that ain’t even worth …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: A quarter of a million, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuuuuuck</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can your man handle that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think so. I mean, we’d have to talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can you set that up?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m getting a 10% finder’s fee from my man if
I can get the right price.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: 10%. That’s …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: 25 grand. You introduce me to your boy, I’ll
cut you five grand out of my take. That’s all you gotta do, just get me
in the door.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Mister, I only deal in high-end weapons. All
guaranteed stolen and traceable only to their original owners. All sales
are final and all prices are negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jimmy, where do you find these people?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The Del Ammo Mall mostly.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You wanna score some go-fast?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Personal protection. It’s a dangerous world
we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.</p>
<p><strong>dude</strong>: You mad dogging me, Bitch?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Heavens no. I was just admiring your
boots.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did you purchase them locally?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign
on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You mean, like to throw ’em off?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, that’s what I mean. Where the hell does
this guy live anyway?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Palmdale</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think on account of his nose.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re going to have to explain that one.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He doesn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re going to have to give me a little more
than that, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Well, you know how Winnie the Pooh always got
his nose stuck in the honey jar? Well, Pooh-Bear snorted so much crank,
they had to cut his nose off. He’s got a plastic one though.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No You think she’s a tweaker?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Okay, here we go gentlemen …</p>
<p><strong>grainy super 8 footage</strong>: the pigeons continue along,
their stupid eyes glazed with confusion.</p>
<p><strong>zapruder</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Oswald?</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Grassy knoll?</p>
<p><strong>grassy knoll</strong>: Ready</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Third shooter?</p>
<p><strong>third shooter</strong>: It’s a go.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: President Kennedy waving to the crowd,
his lovely wife looking radiant beside him as they turn into Dealey
Plaza …</p>
<p><strong>grainy footage</strong>: the car making a turn, the pigeons
oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>grainy footage</strong>: a mass of feathers flying as the
pigeons are hit.</p>
<p><strong>danny/jimmy</strong>: - Cool. - Yeah. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I’m gonna get this developed and send it
to the Warren Commission.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Um, I think the Warren Commission has been
closed for a while.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: No shit? Fuck it. I’ll send it to Oliver
Stone then. He’ll get them to reopen the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>oswald</strong>: Pooh-Bear! We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: So, Danny, Jimmy tells me you have a
proposition for me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who’s looking for
about a quarter’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Crank or glass?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: The good stuff. Can you handle that?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I’m sorry. Would you like a taste?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I insist. It’s delicious. Just a
taste.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Secret recipe.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can we talk price?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Make me an offer.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know, 14,000 a kilo?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of
that faggot metric crap for me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay … How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Hey, okay.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re serious?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Anything for a dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But I just met you.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: But you’re a friend of Jimmy’s. I think
of you as a brother already.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So that’s 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Pooh-Bear, I don’t mean to be rude, but I get
the feeling you aren’t taking me seriously.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Maybe you’re the one who isn’t taking me
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I welcome you here with open arms and you
got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey, I was just trying to …</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I want to tell you about the last guy who
tried to jam me up on a deal.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey, I don’t play that.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I’m sure you don’t. At least I’m sure you
think you don’t. Anyway, I want to tell you. It’s a good story,
guaranteed to break the ice at a party.</p>
<p><strong>quick flash back</strong>: LOW ANGLE SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP of
Pooh-Bear staring down at something OFFSCREEN, a menacing look on his
face.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: You should have heard him howling.</p>
<p><strong>back to present</strong>: Pooh-Bear lights a cigarette</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Then I took a Saws All and I cut His
skull open</p>
<p><strong>quick flash</strong>: CONTINUE SLOW MOTION CLOSE UP.
Pooh-Bear reaching for something OFFSCREEN.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: You know, those Saws All really do cut
through everything.</p>
<p><strong>back to present</strong>: Danny getting nervous.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look, you don’t have to …</p>
<p><strong>quick flash back</strong>: Pooh-Bear looking down at
SOMETHING in his hand, his face blossoming into a sick smile.</p>
<p><strong>back to present</strong>: Danny listens somberly.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: 10,000 a pound</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Now you’re insulting me. Nice talking
business with you.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: 9,000. Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ll leave it. Eight is as high as I’ll go.
See ya’.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: All right, all right. Don’t get your
knickers in a knot. I can live with eight.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: God damn, Danny, you got some nerve.
Pooh-Bear respects that. Oh, by the way …</p>
<p><strong>quick flash back</strong>: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been
standing at the meat section in a GROCERY STORE. He is looking down at
the package of COW BRAINS in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Hmm. Good price.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You want a hit?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Sure, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What does J.F.K. stand for?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Was he the president?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Jimmy</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thanks for not laughing at me.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away.
Everybody had to pay and pay …</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Danny, listen up. Here’s the deal … my wife’s
pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab. They’re getting
a very special delivery a week from this Friday.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is it, drugs?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Better than drugs.</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Bob Hope’s stool specimen We’re gonna boost
it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why in God’s name would we want to do
that?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: So we can sell it.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: To who?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: I don’t know. A collector. Fuck Danny, it’s
Bob Hope.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: He is a national treasure.</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Check it out. This is the lab.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: It’s the lab.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: I mean what kind of drink?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Cuba Libre</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is that? Rum and coke?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I just want to be straight on the details.
Can I taste it?</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: No, you can’t taste it. It’s the fucking lab!
Now shut up.</p>
<p><strong>creeper</strong>: You should use something smaller. He’s the
same size as the office. It doesn’t ring true.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot
….</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: He delivers at four o’clock on the nose every
Friday. Alpha team will be in the elevator with the courier. That’ll be
Danny and Creeper.</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I thought you were done.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: I said hey sugar, take a walk on the wild
side …</p>
<p><strong>kujo</strong>: So what’s it gonna be, Danny boy? You in or
out?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m afraid I’m gonna have to pass on this
one, boys.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You okay? She nods.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Quincey, my boyfriend… he kicked me
out.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look…I’d like to help you out … but I really
don’t want to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I understand. Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t be.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Jesus, I look like a raccoon.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was thinking Alice Cooper.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know …. you could be staking your
financial future on stealing Bob Hope’s stool specimen.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What about the guy on the very bottom?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Leave me out of this.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: That bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nevertheless, I still try to see the glass as
half-full.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was
talking to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Don’t worry, he’s probably passed out with
his head in the toilet by now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This man sounds like a real catch.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Oh, he’s a keeper all right.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Colette …</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look, it’s really none of my business but why
don’t you just dump this guy?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: It’s not that easy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t tell me, down deep he’s really not a
bad person and you don’t want to see him get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I
hate the son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then leave.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s nothing to understand. The guy is a
pig.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I can’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You get off on abuse or something?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then why don’t you leave? Just give me one
good reason.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Because he’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why don’t you call the cops?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Why? They don’t hold him for more than a
day or two.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s long enough to get out of town.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I can’t. I’ve got a kid. She lives with my
parents. Quincey knows where they live.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then make sure he gets put away for
longer.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t know. Let me think about it.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I wanna do a small buy first. Ten thousand.
We’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why? The guys is ready to deal now.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Because I don’t know him and I don’t really
know you, partner.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Now that’s down-right insulting.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I’ll have to live with that. My money my
risk, my rules.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I guess I don’t have a hell of a lot of
choice.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Get used to it. You’re in a very tenuous
position on the food chain, hoss.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: You thinking what I’m thinking?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yeah. This could be the one we’re looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Hold it right there, Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus, you almost gave me a heart attack!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Question is, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I was trying to score some dope.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Cut the shit, Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Someone want to tell me what the hell is
going on here?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we’ll
play.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What did I do?!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You think this is funny motherfucker?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t help it, Tanner, you hit like a
fucking girl.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Garcetti, do something.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: We know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I still don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Okay, let me help you. You’re setting up a
deal with a Chinese redneck. Quarter of a million.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Who the hell is Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: He’s the only one I told.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: And he probably only told two people and
they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than
to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it
on the evening news.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted
to do a biggie. He’s new in town so I offered my services.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: This chink have a name?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Bubba.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You better not be blowing smoke up My ass,
Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: After that ass-whipping you gave me?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: What’s on the other end of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy …
goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He’s a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I’m
sure they’re keeping box scores on the guy.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Sounds like you hooked up with some fine
citizens, Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh they’re all that and the proverbial bag of
chips.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: What’re your taking down?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Standard vig. Minus five for a certain
blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who’s living proof
that natural selection is a flawed theory.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Did you really think you were slick enough
to pull this off?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look man, I just wanted to make some dough
and disappear. I didn’t want to wait around for Domingo to figure out
who doubled back on him.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mean you want me to roll on these
guys?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You’ve got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Whata you mean I’ve got no choice?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Well, if you’d rather do a stretch in la
casa grande …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: For that old possession charge? Gimme a
break.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: No. You just handed us a new one. We can go
Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to
buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank. What’s the mandatory on
that, Al?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Dime, minimum.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: And believe me, word will get out that
you’re a pro rat.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: That’s not good in prison. It’s just not
good.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That would be me.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: What’d you do, piss your pants?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hell, yes! What the hell do you expect
zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Who’d have thought it? Danny “Chickenshit”
Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Lay off, Garcetti. I’m not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: No. You’ve got me all wrong. I mean, in
you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little
sack.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Bullshit. He’s a liar.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: News-flash, Tanner. I’m a fucking rat.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: You think you’re so god damned smart, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Why didn’t you just ask for directions back
there?</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Come on, where’s your pioneer spirit?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You mean like the Donner Party?</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Hey, do you think you could eat me if you
had to? And if so, which part do you think you would find the most
delicious?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Tom, quit fucking around.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Okay, okay. There’s a house up there.
I’ll go ask for directions.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: You think that’s a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Look at that place. It’s creepy.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: First you want me to ask for directions,
then you don’t. Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: I wanted you to ask back there. You know,
before you got us lost.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: Just no pleasing you, is there?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Just admit you’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: We all know how much you like hearing
that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There. You happy?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets
old.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: No. You know what gets old? Being
reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Here it comes, poor Tom.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: But that’s okay, Liz, you’re the one with
the steady job, you pay all the bills. I’m just an unemployed musician.
You have every right.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: That is so unfair.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: My sentiments exactly.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: … Tom … screw it. Tell me when you’re ready to
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sorry, Liz. I love you and I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: This seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What happened to your eye?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Turns out I’m allergic to steel-toed boots.
Go figure. By the way, I’m not looking for a matching set. Where’s
Quincey?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Don’t worry. He’s out of town.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How far out of town?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Trust me. We’re safe.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Miles Davis. “All Blues.”</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful
music.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Like you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nah. I’m strictly minor league… except for
the fucked-up part.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Dude played his soul right out the end of the
horn. No false notes. Always honest.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: And you admire that?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s the only way to play.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Is that how you play?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I try.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: No false notes?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: No deep dark secrets?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: :</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What do you want from me, Colette?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I don’t want anything. Why are you so
suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It gets me through the day.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You really need to lighten up.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look, I can’t help you with Quincey if that’s
what you’re after.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: This has nothing to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So you’re just attracted to me, is that
it?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Yes. Why do you find that so hard to
believe?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How much time do you have?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How much time do you have?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You’ve got a comeback for everything, don’t
you, Danny? You use ’em like some sort of shield.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: There you go again. You’re nothing but
false notes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t like the tune, find another
station.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What are you hiding, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Therapy session is over.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You think you’re the only one down here
with a sad story?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No. But I’m the only one with my sad story.
And that’s how it’s gonna stay.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Several possession charges, but nothing
major.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why doesn’t Palmdale P.D. just raid the
guy?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: They have. But they never found a lab.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s because he doesn’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Whata you mean? He told me -</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off
other drug dealers. As least that’s what the word is.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What’s to stop him from just ripping me off
then?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s probably what he would have done if
we hadn’t found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: You’re lucky, Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Funny, I don’t feel lucky.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: We’re coordinating with Palmdale P.D..
We’ll have your sorry ass covered.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What if he caps me before you can make a
move?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Golly, I hadn’t thought of that.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Don’t we always take good care of you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Speaking of which … you run that license
plate for me?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: You mean the menacing red car?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What? Is it bad?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I’m afraid so, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Brace yourself.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on! Who is it? Domingo’s boys?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Worse. Much worse. A teacher.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy
Plummer.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: She’s 57 and she’s been teaching third
grade for the last 33 years.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Now that’s scary!</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: You’re paranoid, Flynne. I think that
crank is finally starting to get the best of you.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: When is the deal going down?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m making the small buy tonight … if I don’t
get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something. If everyone is
happy, we’ll do the big deal later in the week.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You sure you don’t want me to go with
you?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Pooh-Bear, my man. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: He’s blue.</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: Comin’ down from a 10 day ride.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You want to do this some other time?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Pull your pants down.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Pull your motherfucking pants down.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, guys …</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Big Bill.</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: Argh, matie. I’m a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Little Bill</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Pooh-Bear. come on, man. What is this? It’s
me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Big Bill</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Captain Steubing thinks you might work
for the police.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Don’t address me. I didn’t make the
accusation.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Please .. I don’t know what you’re …</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Uh-uh-uh …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus Christ. Um … I’m not .. Captain
Steubing. I’m not working for the cops.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: He don’t believe you. Big Bill.</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: Drop your package in the cage.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My what?</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: Put your pee-pee through the hole.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is fucking crazy!</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh fuck … oh Jesus …</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Okay! Okay!</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Now get talkin’</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I didn’t fucking do anything! I swear to
God!</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: You got something to tell Captain
Steubing, you’d better do it now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Captain Steubing, listen to me. You’re after
the wrong guy. This is the fuck you should be talking to.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: That’s a pack of discharge.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s true. Jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role
at a bar the other night … said he was dissin’ your ass in front of one
of your customers.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Man’ll say a lot of thing when he’s
sporting weasel food for a pecker.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Least I can do is check it out
though.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can I pull my dick out now?</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can I pull my dick out?</p>
<p><strong>big bill</strong>: He’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>little bill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I ought to just call this whole thing off
right now.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Don’t do that. Please. Or I’ll kill you.
Please, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What the hell was that? Who told you I was
five-0?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: No one. It was just a test. I need to be
sure of who I’m dealing with from time-to-time.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Did it ever occur to you that someone might
cop to something they didn’t do rather than have their balls chewed off
by a rabid weasel?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: We’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Good work, Flynne. You’re a first-rate
rat.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: That’s real sweet, Garcetti. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: We got the 411 on your good old boy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Murder. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police
informant.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You know, I’m starting to think I’d rather
take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Didn’t you hear? Domingo’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Took a pig-slicker to the heart.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I thought you’d be happy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>catholic icons abound</strong>: crucifixes, Virgin Mary’s,
needle point prayers.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s Tom.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: All right, Nancy, how’d you track me
down?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down
in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized
you.</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: Highway Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He said you were … the people you Were with …
well …</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: Said you were a drug addict.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Maybe I should just go.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No. We want to help you, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Closure? How do you find closure when her
killers are still running around out there?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I found forgiveness in my heart for the
people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Is that what you want me to do? Put it all on
Jesus? Let him sort it out in the afterlife?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You’ve got to deal with this sooner or later,
Tom. You can’t keep hiding.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Maybe I am dealing with it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know it’s not my place to pass judgement on
you but …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then why don’t I see any pictures Of me up
there?</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: That was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You never did like me much, did you Verne?
And you can’t stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn’t.
You think I’m a coward, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you, a persecute you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m genuinely happy that you found some
peace, Nancy. But you can’t forgive for Liz. No one can. And you can’t
forgive for me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Your hatred makes them stronger and you
weaker.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t buy that. There’s a place for hatred.
Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was
killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to
her. Do you know what that feels like?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s not too late to show her you’re
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: By not disgracing her memory!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: You might as well be spitting on her grave
every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently
forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>verne</strong>: Understand what?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing. It’s … it’s complicated. I just want
you to know … I’m not what you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m kind of busy.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Please open the door, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: We been through that.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What about a battered woman’s shelter? You
can move you kid in with you.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I need my paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You can still work.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: He knows where I work.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Find a new job.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: It’s not that easy. I just got a raise. I
need the money.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You always been this stubborn?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: From day one. I was a breach birth. They
tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn’t let
’em.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ass first into the world.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I been that way ever since.</p>
<p><strong>colette/danny</strong>: Ouch. They laugh.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Can we try that again?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I just can’t. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What’s wrong, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Look, maybe you oughta’ leave.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: No. I want to know what the hell is going
on.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: There’s someone else, isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m so tired of lying.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: What you want to do is go back the way you came
and make a left at the bottom. It’ll take you right to the highway.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Are you Australian?</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Good. I fucking hate Australians.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: You got a bathroom I can use before we
hit the road?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Yeah? First door on the right. It ain’t that
dirty. Just kinda’ filthy is all.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: You mind?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: No, I don’t mind. That’s how come I told you
about it.</p>
<p><strong>danny/tom</strong>: I was talking to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>liz</strong>: Try to make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: You know. This and that.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Skeeters. They’re bad up here.</p>
<p><strong>intruder one</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She died knowing that I was a coward… that I
didn’t lift a finger to help her.</p>
<p><strong>collette</strong>: There was nothing you could have done.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, you’re wrong, I tried to tell myself the
same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: They would have killed you too.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing could be worse then this slow death
I’m living now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Colette…I want to help you, with Quincey.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: No Danny, Don’t-</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Really, I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I want to do this for you. I want to do
something good for a change.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out
the baggie. Colette backs away.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m offering you the chance to take care of
your problems. Take it. Don’t make the same mistake I did, Colette. Do
something while you have a chance. Do it for your daughter before
something happens. Believe me, you don’t want to live with this burden.
He helds the baggie out again. Colette reluctantly takes it from
him.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Will you do that? Then I want you to get out
of the room.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Just go across the
street and watch. You’ll know when it’s safe to go back.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just do it. All your problems with Quincey
will be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could
spare. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But why? You only owe me five. And that’s not
till after we close the deal tonight.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You aren’t coming with me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Wait till I tell you what it is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It don’t matter. I’ll do it. And you sure as
hell don’t have to pay me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re my best friend, man. I’d do anything
for you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Jimmy, look, there’s something I have to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, check it out…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s you! I didn’t have a picture or nothin’
so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m not a tweaker. I don’t use drugs. I never
had.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But…I’ve seen you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: When? When did you ever see me use?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This isn’t like that Queen Elizabeth
question, is it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You ever notice how I always showed up, in
the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for
cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I’d just
done one?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No one ever noticed?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out
tweakers? It was easy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: But… why? Why would you pretend?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You don’t trust me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t trust anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And you want me to do you some big favor?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wait If you don’t trust me, why did you tell
me that stuff about not using drugs?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because I don’t want to see you end up like
Kujo and those other losers. I thought that maybe if you knew that I
didn’t use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You mad at me, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know… a little. I wish you would have
let me in on it from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sorry. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You know you can get that tattoo removed,
don’t you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nah… I want to keep it. Maybe I can use it
for like, inspiration …you know…like when I detox?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Good for you Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I really want you to take this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wouldn’t be a favor if you were paying me.
I’ll just take my five when the deal is done.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re a good man. Jimmy the Finn.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Everything go?</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Just make sure you come alone. This guy won’t
like any surprises</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: I ain’t a idiot, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Man of few words.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: With you clowns watching my back? What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Just make sure you hit the floor when we
come in. It could get ugly in there.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Yeah, I’d hate to shoot you by accident.</p>
<p><strong>int. plumber’s truck-same</strong>: AN HISPANIC GUY behind
the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guy</strong>: He’s coming in.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>bubba</strong>: You ready to go meet the team?</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: For those of you who don’t know this is Tom
Van Allen… a.k.a. Danny Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: He’s a civilian? How the hell did you
pull this off?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I played the long shot. Just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: How about the car? The model?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: All I saw was the headlights. The high beams
were on.</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: Not even a guess?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: How many times do we have to go through
this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, but he was in silhouette.</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: How about in the house?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: They were wearing ski masks. I told you all
of this.</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: Did you see his hair color?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: No, Why?</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: Forensics found this on your wife.</p>
<p><strong>bookman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Nothing, I’m trying to remember…</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: Why didn’t you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Because I wanted to find them myself I wanted
to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>detail of a photo</strong>: a balding red head with a streak
of white running through it.</p>
<p><strong>reveal rest of photo</strong>: It is TANNER. Underneath the
photo, his major: criminology.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I swear to God I would have done ’em right
then and there…but I had to be positive. And even if Tanner was
involved, I had to be sure about</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So I became Danny Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I dropped myself right in their laps.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I gave up whoever they asked for, whenever
they wanted. I was a fucking dream rat. But the whole time I was sizing
them up, looking for any evidence that they were the guys who killed my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: But they did everything by the book.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I knew that if these were the guys I was
looking for, I’d have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn’t be able
to walk away from it.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: That’s when he called me. He told me his
story and he pitched me a plan.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn’t
hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: We had one of our C.I.’s call Tanner and
Garcetti with an “anonymous” tip about the deal.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: This could be the one we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>battle</strong>: …I dumped a dummy file into the system. They
took the bait and we were off to the races.</p>
<p><strong>agent two</strong>: How sure are you that you’re not chasing
two good cops? I mean all you’ve really got is one red hair. That’s
still your only evidence.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: Not anymore. We tapped these guys’ phones and
computers at Gardena P.D. Tanner and Garcetti didn’t report on this
deal. Not a peep. They haven’t coordinated with Palmdale P.D. They’re
keeping it off the books. It looks like we’ve got the right guys. We’ll
find out for sure tonight.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: How you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m fine. Little nervous…little disappointed
that I didn’t finish this myself.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn’t
have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your
ass alive.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh shit</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her
boyfriend’s a real piece of shit-dude’s really jamming her up. I
promised her I’d try to help.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey guys…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I need to stop for some cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: All right people, heads up. Blue
team?</p>
<p><strong>maid one</strong>: I’ve got a visual.</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: Red team?</p>
<p><strong>workman one</strong>: He’s heading to his room.</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: Black team?</p>
<p><strong>agent one</strong>: Okay. It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Half an hour to kickoff.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>trahn</strong>: You alone?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Danny told me to tell you that he was sorry.
He said he had to take care of this himself.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Easy, boy.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Where’s Bubba?</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Maybe he isn’t showing.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Looks like Flynne’s handling the cash. Let’s
get into position.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Just some buddies.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This is bullshit. You didn’t say anything
about anybody else being here.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: What the fuck are you gonna do about it,
dickhead?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Come on, man, let’s deal.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Cool it. We got business.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Oh my, oh my. Big Bill, come take a look
at this.</p>
<p><strong>pooh-bear</strong>: Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy. Pooh- Bear
done shot himself.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Anybody there?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m here, Liz. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>garcetti</strong>: Get the bag.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My name is Tom.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Whatever you say, man. Look … can we talk
about this?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully … You’re in the
bathroom. You’ve been shot in the shoulder …</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Please … don’t do this …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Answer the fucking question!</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Does that answer your question? I fight. I
fight and I die like a man. You’re a fucking coward, Flynne. You lived
like one and now you’re gonna die like one.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Glock semi-automatic 9 mm …</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Tenifer matte finish, Polymer grip, fixed
sights, 4 and 1/2 inch barrel, 22 ounces, double action and a …</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: … and a TEN ROUND magazine …</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Too late to be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Ten it is.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My name is Tom Van Allen. I’m a trumpet
player.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Nah, you’re Danny Flynne.</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: You’re a motherfucking rat.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You said you wouldn’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: You lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: Oops. My bad.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Colette, what happened? Didn’t the cops …</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: The cops came. But they didn’t find
nothing. Turns out their C.I. game ’em some bad information.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You set me up?</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: Bitch played you like a squeezebox,
Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You’re good, princess. I’ll give you
that.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: Danny, it’s not what you think.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I owed them money … a lot of money … they
didn’t give me a choice. You know how it works. When I got to know you,
I tried to back out … that’s when they did this … But I told them I
wouldn’t do it .. I didn’t want to see you get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: She selling me a bill, home boy?</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: Nah, she ain’t lying. She took a pretty
good beating from you, ace. I seen grown men crack after a lot less. But
not this bitch. It was very touching.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Then why are we here?</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: They threatened to kill my daughter. I had
no choice. I’m sorry, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s okay. It’s okay. God damn, you’re
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>quincey</strong>: You wanna die here with him or come with
me?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Colette, go.</p>
<p><strong>colette</strong>: I don’t want to leave you.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Your daughter needs you. Go.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: So what is it? Who am I after it’s all said
and done?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh shit. What is this?</p>
<p><strong>tatto</strong>: Hang in there buddy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Well, I’ve had some time to think about it
and it’s pretty simple after all. I guess it’s like the man said - “Man
is the measure of all things.” I should know. I ran the gamut. Avenging
Angel, Judas, loving husband, prodigal son, prince of Denmark. I was all
of those things. Tom Van Allen got his revenge. Good for Tom. And Danny
Flynne? He got gut-shot for being the low-life rat that he was. Sucks
for him. But as far as I’m concerned, they’re both dead.</p>
