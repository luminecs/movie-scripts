<h1 id="the-manchurian-candidate">the-manchurian-candidate</h1>
<p><strong>the manchurian candidate</strong>: By</p>
<p><strong>in black:</strong>: 1 Restless bodies. Scuffing of feet.
Somebody coughs. 1</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: Approximately sixty four hundred
hours before Desert Storm, we were on a routine recon inside
Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength for what Saddam
Hussein promised to be the mother of all wars … but turned out to be
just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. desert - night 2</strong>: PROWLING ACROSS undulating
land dotted with BURNING OIL WELLS that give the vague impression of,
well, hell. The inky sky is awash with stars.</p>
<p><strong>on the crest of a dune</strong>: A U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING
VEHICLE and matching HUMMER sit, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>kuwait, 1991</strong>: Muffled THUMP of rap music thrums from
the Bradley, and low voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Why can’t we go directly in …</p>
<p><strong>3 int./ext. the hummer - night 3</strong>: A topographical
MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop portable, faintly lighting the
faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT
TOKAR.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: … this way –?</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Yes, well – I see the Captain enjoys the
road less travelled.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass down
the highway for every Tom, Dick and Qadhafi to take a whack at.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Well. Of course it is very bad, here. And
here. And here, here, here, here –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Mines?</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Tricky. Swedish-made.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Nobody at Command said anything about –</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Exxon and Global Petroleum hired private
contractors to do the work in ’86, as part of their asset security
program. Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now, well – only they know
where the little Nordic fuckers are planted.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sgt. Shaw!</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Rolling in two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes, Captain. Everything’s fine. Here. I’ll
“rally” the troops.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. the bradley fighting vehicle - night 4</strong>: MUSIC
blares around eight soldiers, including wiseguy PFC. ED MAVOLE, crowded
into space designed for four –</p>
<p><strong>mavole</strong>: Yo Melvin. You gonna play that hand, or
hatch it?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: We’re moving out.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. the bradley - night 5</strong>: Raymond waits. Another
beat. Then some LAUGHTER from inside the vehicle. He shifts his
shoulders, walks back into the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. hummer - night - travelling 8</strong>: Marco,
bug-like in night goggles, drives the infamous Highway of Death – a
macabre landscape of abandoned cars, trucks, minivans, shopping baskets,
broken wooden pushcarts and festering fires; pots and pans and clothes
and personal belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side
of the road. Laurent rides shotgun. Raymond is in the back, facing
forward, rifle at ease.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why don’t I ever ride in the Bradley with
the other enlisted personnel?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Maybe I enjoy your company, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Sir, I don’t want to be singled out for
special treatment because of my mother’s position –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Too late for that, Shaw. As a charter member
of the Lucky Sperm Club your benefits include unlimited suck-up from
High-ranking Officers hoping to curry Congressional favor for their
future career moves. But. If you want to ride in the Bradley, hey, I got
no objections.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Trust me, sir, I don’t wish to ride in the
Bradley with the others, I’m just … The men don’t care for me very
much.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No, they don’t. But. On the plus side, you
don’t really like them, either.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That’s absolutely correct, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: So. See? It, you know. Balances out.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: – Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>9 night vision goggles: just over a dune 9</strong>: SOLDIERS
ON CAMELS slip along like ghosts, pacing the Hummer, parallel at maybe
fifty yards –</p>
<p><strong>whip pan</strong>: Through the driver’s side window: more of
the CAMEL CAVALRY tracks with them –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Camels. You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>10 back to - hummer - marco 10</strong>: glancing to his
rear-view mirror –</p>
<p><strong>11 in the mirror - on the road behind them: 11</strong>: Two
dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness, on either side of the
Bradley Fighting Vehicle – They SLAM together in a pincer-wedge just in
front of it, and the Bradley CRASHES into them – climbs over them, off-
balance, and SMASHES DOWN onto the roof of one of the trucks and is
effectively low-bridged – tracks spinning, unable to move – DARK FIGURES
scurry from the trucks. back at the helpless Bradley. Automatic weapons
fire in bursts, bright, and ricochet harmlessly away – IN THE HUMMER –
MARCO scrambles up out of his seat, pops the roof hatch and screams at
Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Take the wheel, Sergeant!</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. hummer - night 13</strong>: – as Marco emerges to
take the handles of the roof-mounted machine gun – drops his NVGs back
over his eyes and FIRES at the dispersing enemy figures around the
Bradley –</p>
<p><strong>14 int. bradley fighting vehicle - night 14</strong>: Marco’s
cover fire RATTLES insanely off the armor –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Quarter million dollars of U.S. Army
hardware rat-fucked by a coupla used Toyotas.</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. marco’s night vision goggles: the desert 17</strong>:
TRACER BULLETS. A lone enemy SOLDIER runs forward lugging a personal
rocket launcher – disappears behind a dune – rifle and rolling toward
the back of the Hummer – as he kicks out of the rear door –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Shaw! Sniper with an RPG! DON’T STOP!</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. hummer - continuous 19</strong>: – Marco is firing
before his feet touch the ground.</p>
<p><strong>20 night vision goggles: the desert 20</strong>: Rocket
Launcher man does a face-plant in the sand. out, coughing, hacking, guns
ready. surprised Marco – Raymond has lost control, fishtails into a deep
trough – the Hummer lurches onto its side, engine racing – wheels
spinning uselessly in air – stalling –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Oh shit, Shaw –</p>
<p><strong>24 omitted 24</strong>: 25 THE ROCKET hits the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle at a slant into 25</p>
<p><strong>a boy’s voice</strong>: Were you scared?</p>
<p><strong>flash forward: major ben marco - day</strong>: behind a
podium, in his crisp dress uniform. His current self: older, tired. Lost
for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Scared? You don’t really have time to be
scared.</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. the kuwaiti highway - night - marco 27</strong>:
raises his head. SEES: – the Bradley, in flames. – the Hummer, on its
side in the ditch, headlights aglow – – shadows of enemy soldiers,
retreating across the dunes. – MILITARY HELICOPTERS materializing out of
the smoke and darkness … circling … NO SOUND –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I couldn’t hear anything, as I was
temporarily deaf from the explosion of the Bradley …</p>
<p><strong>in slowing motion:</strong>: 28 MARCO’S SQUAD – the effect of
the gas is immediate: Mavole 28</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I got your back, Baker. I got …</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – and with complete disregard for his own
life and safety, Sgt. Shaw single- handedly engaged an entire company of
the enemy –</p>
<p><strong>flash forward: major marco</strong>: Behind the podium,
repeating himself:</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – of the enemy –</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. kuwaiti two-lane - night 32</strong>: The Hummer
weaves through the wreckage, one of its tires WHIRLING IN FLAMES –
Raymond has the machine gun SPITTING BULLETS recklessly at the
helicopters like a cartoon hero –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sgt. Shaw repeatedly attacked from a mobile
position, confounding the enemy –</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. kuwaiti two-lane - night 34</strong>: One of the
helicopters EXPLODES, the other spins away, trailing smoke and
flames.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – neutralizing his aerial support –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – and finally dividing and defeating an
overwhelmingly superior force.</p>
<p><strong>36 int. high school auditorium - continuous 36</strong>: A
Boy Scout luncheon banquet.</p>
<p><strong>washington d.c., now</strong>: A full chicken buffet table,
banners, flags, and over one hundred SCOUTS, LEADERS and DADS, all
looking somewhat attentively up at the guest speaker, U.S. Army Major
Ben Marco.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Like Edmonds in Korea, Holderman in Viet Nam,
Raymond Shaw was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I signed the
recommendation myself.</p>
<p><strong>another scout</strong>: Were you wounded?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I was –</p>
<p><strong>fb36 flash: marco on the kuwaiti two-lane fb36</strong>:
Turning away from the overturned Humvee, and right into a head-high
rifle-butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas mask-wearing figure.</p>
<p><strong>resume - auditorium - marco</strong>: He blinks.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – injured. I fell, had a, uh, concussion –
lost focus – Sgt. Shaw took command –</p>
<p><strong>scout dad</strong>: Did your unit sustain any casualties?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes. Two. Two of my people were killed.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: The Medal of Honor is the highest award to
which any soldier can aspire. From the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert
of Kuwait, what these brave men I’ve talked about today did will never
be forgotten. Since 1917, only 827 medals have been given to a total of
more than 30 million Americans in arms. Only three have been awarded in
the last 40 years. Who knows? Maybe someday one of you fine boys will
earn one yourself in defense of this great nation.</p>
<p><strong>scoutmaster</strong>: Major Marco, on behalf of Troops 484
and 488 – just like to thank you, for coming to talk to us, about the
Medal of Honor, and your interesting experiences in the Armed
Services.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Thanks for listening. My family has claimed
the Army as a trade ever since a young gunnery officer who grew up with
Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at the upper Mississippi. My life
is in service to my country.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You ever wish it’d been you?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Won the medal. Been the hero.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No, I’m just proud to have been there.</p>
<p><strong>37 int. h.s. auditorium entrance - later 37</strong>: The
luncheon is breaking up. A couple of scouts chase each other through the
clusters of men. Marco’s leaving. Men stop him to shake his hand and
thank him for coming.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Major Marco.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: It’s Al Melvin, Sir. Corporal Melvin. From
your unit. Desert Storm.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Melvin. Jesus – how are you –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: I have these dreams, Major.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Dreams.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Yeah. Kuwait. You and me. Mavole, and Baker.
Raymond Shaw. See, I remember it happened the way you just said. And
then I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Well, we had a pretty rough time over there,
Al, it was hairy, and – it was a long time ago, now. Memories shift.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Do you have dreams, sir?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Everybody has dreams, Corporal –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Not these.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: It’s bad, sir. It’s making me crazy. I write
it down, every night, after I wake up, I try to get it all – it doesn’t
always go together – all of what I can remember, and –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Al, you know, maybe you should be going to
the VA and talking to a doctor, I mean if these dreams are really –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: – I’ve been to doctors!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: I’m so stuck, sir. I mean – I remember Shaw
saving us, but it does not make sense – it should have been you. And
Shaw, he –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Well, that’s – it’s over and done. We’ve got
to move on –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: I can’t get my hand around it. I thought
maybe, if you had the dreams …</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You need money –?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: No. No sir.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – here –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: I don’t need your money.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Okay. Okay. Well, look, Al, I gotta –</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – run, yeah. But. It was great seeing you.
And good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. h.s. parking lot - day 38</strong>: Marco is
motionless in his car, head resting against the steering wheel. He
straightens up, with a thousand-yard stare. His hands are trembling.
Slowly, he grips the steering wheel … tighter and tighter … until the
trembling stops.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. supermarket - check-out counter - night 39</strong>:
A pretty CASHIER empties Marco’s basket: bottled water, three romance
novels, a bottle of No-Doz, a bag of tomatoes and two dozen boxes of
instant noodles.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. apartment building - corridor - night 40</strong>:
Marco comes up the stairs with his groceries. An ELDERLY WOMAN sticks
her head out from her apartment door:</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: – Thirty seven.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: From the landing. Every week it gets longer.
I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: From the landing. Every week it gets longer.
I’m worried about you.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: None of these involve slave traders or
sheiks, Abby. I checked.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: A smile.</p>
<p><strong>41 int. marco’s studio apartment - night 41</strong>: He
enters, and a visible exhaustion overtakes him. He turns on the t.v.,
and sags to the sofa bed, drained.</p>
<p><strong>behind him - on a bulletin board:</strong>: yellowing
newspaper clippings and wire photographs of Raymond Shaw. SENATOR’S SON
SAVES UNIT IN KUWAIT. “LOST</p>
<p><strong>congressional seat; will be youngest member of house
…</strong>: Marco’s not letting anything go.</p>
<p><strong>tv41 on the television tv41</strong>: News coverage, the
crowded floor of a political convention:</p>
<p><strong>roving reporter</strong>: – with public anxiety rekindled by
the events of Bloody Friday, with the war on terror marching into yet
another year, no end in sight –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yawns – his eyelids flutter – he shudders
awake, digs in his grocery bag for the No Doz and shakes out half a
dozen. Which he swallows dry.</p>
<p><strong>roving reporter</strong>: – the American people are looking
for a new agenda – but because this party remains deeply divided on so
many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the key
unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way
Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 …</p>
<p><strong>42 int. marco’s apartment - later 42</strong>: Marco sits at
a clearing on the tiny kitchen table, eating instant noodles and trying
to read Prizzi’s Honor.</p>
<p><strong>tv42 voice/jordan tv42</strong>: We need to look inward –
attend to our own house – the danger to our country is not from some
terrorists at large – terrorists we’ve helped engender with twenty years
of failed foreign policy –</p>
<p><strong>on the television</strong>: News coverage, the crowded floor
of a political convention. A poised, silvery, avuncular man, SENATOR
THOMAS JORDAN on the podium:</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: – no, the real danger is from suspending
civil liberties, gutting the Bill of Rights, allowing our fear to
destroy our democratic ideals –</p>
<p><strong>43 int. hotel suite - night 43</strong>: The same speech
continues, largely ignored by Congressman RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW. Still
intense and moody, the new</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … I am not a professional politician. I am
not a professional politician …</p>
<p><strong>tv43 jordan tv43</strong>: – because once we start
overturning our constitutional protections, our enemies have won.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … I am … a professional politician.
Not.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond? Darling, what were you going to do,
make me stand out there like room service?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman, your
‘wrangler’ – helpful Ms. Freeman – said you were up here practicing your
speech. Honestly, I don’t understand why you insist upon isolating
yourself, people adore you, Raymond, they crave your company and yet
here you are, holed up, as if you were some kind of emotionally
challenged individual like your father instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw,
a handsome, intelligent, people-loving war hero with a great deal to
offer to his party and his country.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No what? Baby, I haven’t even asked you a
question. Your hair is too flat. And that tie. The tie is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No to the question you’re going to ask. No
to all the questions you pretend to want to ask –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Something a little less busy.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – and no you may not engage in your usual
back-door political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh. You’re not interested? I thought you
were. Did I miss my cue?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Of course I’m interested – I wouldn’t be
here if I wasn’t – but not if it means attacking the reputation of a
statesman like Thomas Jordan, which I’m sure was your plan. Let
democracy run its course, mother. Let the people decide.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry, for a second there I thought it
was your father speaking – that dreaded Shaw blood rising – and the
stink of defeat made me nauseous.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Mother –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And excuse me, when have I ever attacked the
honorable Mr. Jordan, despite the shameful way his daughter misled you
that summer at the shore.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Mother, you chased her away –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: If that’s how you want to remember it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – you ruined everything.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Honey, you’re oversimplifying things somewhat
– but, yes, okay – I promise, promise I will stay out of it. You have my
word.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: After all, you’re young and you have plenty
of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover, as your father
did, that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science, and the meek do
not happily inherit the earth, but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs,
chewed up, digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of
American politics.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: One day, you will, I’m sure, tearfully
memorialize me in your acceptance speech. Don’t you have a different tie
in here? Your grandfather always let me pick his ties.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m wearing the one I have on.</p>
<p><strong>44 close - convention podium - night 44</strong>: Raymond is
speaking. His tie is different. So is he: now he exudes a telegenic
warmth and vivacity, his manner confident, easy, open.</p>
<p><strong>tv44 raymond tv44</strong>: I’ve always said I am not a
professional politician, although I hold, and have been held – well,
hugged – in elected office – – you all know my mother, Senator Eleanor
Prentiss Shaw …</p>
<p><strong>45 int. marco’s apartment - night 45</strong>: Marco, on the
sofa, stares hard at the televised Raymond Shaw, as:</p>
<p><strong>tv45 raymond/t.v. tv45</strong>: … and some of you no doubt
remember my father … the late Senator John Shaw. I’ve been honored to
serve my two terms in Congress. But I also grew up on the Hill. I’ve
seen how the game is played by professionals –</p>
<p><strong>46 int. convention hall - back stage 46</strong>: Ellie in
the f.g., intently watching a monitor while, in the deep b.g., slightly
out of focus, we can SEE Raymond speaking, and his convention audience
beyond …</p>
<p><strong>tv46 raymond tv46</strong>: – how deals are struck,
committees bullied, agendas bought and sold – and, with apologies to my
mother, I wish to remain an amateur. I believe democracy is not
negotiable. We need to secure tomorrow, today.</p>
<p><strong>47 convention center corridor, back stage - continuous
47</strong>: TRACKING with Ellie and Gillespie and his two aides, and a
posse of three other FORMIDABLE-LOOKING POLITICIANS through a hallway
crowded with NETWORK CAMERA CREWS, STRAY DELEGATES, HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING
BAND members and a complete DRILL TEAM in red-white-and-blue sequined
leotards, as:</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Bluffing?</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: That was the inference.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: They should be down on their fat white knees
thanking me for saving this party from committing political seppuku.</p>
<p><strong>congressman healy</strong>: You gave them every opportunity
to do the right thing, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No. I gave them one opportunity. And that was
unusually generous of me.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. convention back room - continuous 48</strong>:
Raymond’s speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen DELEGATES
and POWER PLAYERS with “Arthur For President” buttons grimly watch Ellie
breeze in. Party Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her:</p>
<p><strong>utly</strong>: The decision is final, Senator. Tom Jordan is
on the ticket. We don’t need your blessing, but we’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Before we get started, I’m dying to know:
which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from
Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses
is unconstitutional?</p>
<p><strong>utly</strong>: All the research indicates that an Arthur-
Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: ‘Sits quite well’ translates into how many
votes?</p>
<p><strong>senator wells</strong>: Your son is largely unknown outside
of New York. His public service, his Congressional record, while
commendable, is –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My son is a war hero.</p>
<p><strong>congressman flores</strong>: Governor Arthur has agreed to
consider Raymond for a cabinet post.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: We didn’t come here to have a discussion.</p>
<p><strong>utly ellie</strong>: Senator –</p>
<p><strong>senator wells</strong>: Ellie, you don’t have the votes to
block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Even running against this cut-and-fold vice
president, with his party’s record of abysmal failure at home and
abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help. Consider. The Governor
is a corn-belt candidate who – scratch and sniff – looks and smells alot
like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without,
thank God, the helmet. Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the
Northeast, plus his home ground, and California. We’re still dead in the
South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides. The mid-central is a
toss- up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of
his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles
the military vote over his “terrorism isn’t a war it’s a social disease”
nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You know this. Your own polls and surveys
back me up. You’re counting on Jordan to help you get the black vote,
women, college kids – my gut instinct says he won’t – and Arthur holding
the center – where he’s soft at best. And who’s to say the President
won’t throw troops into another third- world skirmish, pushing his
sidekick’s approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign
off the front pages?</p>
<p><strong>utly</strong>: We’re confident this is a winning ticket,
Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’s your margin of error? Five points?
Three? I can swing that, and you know it. I can swing seven away from
you – more than enough to split the party and –</p>
<p><strong>senator wells</strong>: – and deny us the White House for
four more years? No. Not even you would do that, Senator. You’re
bluffing.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: America is facing the greatest test of its
history, gentlemen. Not just from terrorist organizations both outside
and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations
so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to
protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we
get around to them. Am I the only one in this room paying attention to
the NSA reports? We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own
soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders
who insist that human beings are essentially Good … and that Power is
something shameful, and Evil. Make no mistake, the people of this great
country are frightened. They know what’s coming. They can feel it. And
we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them,
with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart –
forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives
hung in the balance.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. convention floor - night 49</strong>: One of Ellie’s
back-room adversaries at the microphone, as balloons fall and the crowd
CHEERS:</p>
<p><strong>tv49 senator wells tv49</strong>: – proud to offer into
nomination the name of the next vice president of these United States,
RAYMOND SHAAAWWWWWW –!</p>
<p><strong>50 int. marco’s studio apartment - night 50</strong>: The
images on the television flicker across Marco, who stares with apparent
disbelief at the coverage:</p>
<p><strong>tv50 newscaster #1 tv50</strong>: … a remarkable development
–</p>
<p><strong>tv50a on the podium - raymond tv50a</strong>: Hands held
high, linked with the presidential candidate, ROBERT ARTHUR who is
clearly eclipsed by Raymond’s youth, his heroic good looks, his natural
charisma …</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: – like a long shot catching the
favorite on the back stretch of the Derby …</p>
<p><strong>media icon</strong>: Raymond Shaw bears the lineage of the
fabled Prentiss family dynasty – grandson of legendary industrialist and
diplomat Tyler Prentiss, son of controversial Senator Eleanor Prentiss
Shaw, who took over the seat vacated by her husband, the esteemed John
Shaw, when he died tragically over twenty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>media icon</strong>: For many, Raymond Prentiss Shaw is an
enigma: millionaire Harvard honors student who enlists in the military
–</p>
<p><strong>intercut</strong>: NEWS FILE FOOTAGE of Raymond’s personal
history:</p>
<p><strong>media icon</strong>: – refusing the officer’s commission to
which he was entitled. The Medal of Honor winner beloved by the men of
the ‘Lost Patrol’ he saved from an enemy ambush, and then guided back
across the open desert to safety –</p>

<p><strong>51 push in on the television: tight - a red supertomato
51</strong>: now commands the screen, plump and glistening in an olive-
skinned hand decorated with intricate henna tattoos –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – transformed the common garden
tomato, through genome-level intervention, from that fragile, fickle,
vulnerable fruit one must struggle to simply nurture to maturity –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – into a resilient, dependable,
categorically superior individual in every conceivable way –</p>
<p><strong>mysterious woman</strong>: – strappingly resistant to
parasite, disease, over-ripening and systemic failure – while, at the
same time, fiercely heat and water tolerant –</p>
<p><strong>mysterious woman</strong>: – yet – note the complexity of the
frontal lobe – nevertheless retaining a sweet, juicy plumpness
reminiscent of the finest English Beefsteak or Italian Plum.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious woman</strong>: Those of you with ties to the
Intelligence community may recall the CIA’s misguided MK-ULTRA program,
the KGB’s Novichok research, and similar half- assed ventures in Great
Britain and China – under the lay term of ‘mind control.’</p>
<p><strong>54 omitted 54</strong>: 55 The Bedouin women begin to make a
spooky trilling sound, 55</p>
<p><strong>mysterious woman</strong>: Street-corner schizophrenics with
tin foil on their heads offer sad proof of the failure of those
endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>myst. w./noyle’s voice</strong>: I can assure you, this is a
whole new ball game.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Captain Marco –</p>
<p><strong>dr. atticus noyle</strong>: the mysterious Arabic woman has
become the sleek, Caucasian scientist, ATTICUS NOYLE, whose oddly
accented English is flawless:</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: – when you’re rescued and returned with your
patrol to command headquarters, what will be among the first duties you
will undertake?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’ll recommend Sergeant Shaw for the Medal of
Honor, ma’am. He saved our lives, terminated the enemy and led us across
the desert to safety.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Yes. Brilliant. But there were
casualties?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: There are always casualties, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Here, then, are ten subject soldiers in a
clinically-induced functional fugue state. Hyperdelusional that they’ve
been bivouacked in a small caravansary to wait out a sandstorm.</p>
<p><strong>mysterious woman</strong>: A simple Pavlovian parlor
trick.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Our Candidate’s course of treatment will, of
course, involve considerably more sophisticated intervention over a
sustained time period, to ensure that a stable mechanism is irrevocably
in place. We employ a kind of neurocellular conversion. Psychological
abreaction through genomic repurposing. “But Dr. Noyle, all the
literature – all the literature says you cannot make an individual act
against his deepest moral nature – or his own self interest.” Hmmm.
Let’s see. Sgt. Shaw. Ever killed anyone?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Not even in combat?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Brilliant. Casualty time.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Raymond. Suffocate Private Mavole.</p>
<p><strong>mavole</strong>: Whoawhoa – wait – wait a sec –</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: And at the instant he completes this, or any
task, Raymond has already forgotten that he has ever been involved in
it.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. marco’s studio apartment - night 58</strong>: Marco
willing himself awake – like a man shaking off death itself – the t.v.’s
a blurred reflection warped across the window glass behind him:</p>
<p><strong>tv58 newscaster #2 tv58</strong>: … Wisconsin makes it
official. Raymond Shaw is the vice-presidential nominee …</p>
<p><strong>59 ext. series of shots - washington d.c. - day 59</strong>:
Monuments, stark and cold. Capitol Hill. Supreme Court. The White House.
The Lincoln Memorial … the Pentagon.</p>
<p><strong>a60 ext. walter reed army hospital - day a60</strong>:
Establishing, as:</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Taking your meds?</p>
<p><strong>60 int. walter reed hospital - army shrink’s office - day
60</strong>: Marco with LT. COL. HOWARD, a kindly but pedantic Army
staff psychiatrist, referring to notes:</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes sir. No sir.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: The meds make me … spongy. I float. I’m not
sharp –</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: The meds help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: When I sleep, I dream. I don’t want to dream,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: You’re off your meds,
sleep-deprived, you have an unexpected encounter with a member of your
Gulf War recon team, Al Melvin, who mentions some dreams he’s been
having –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Dreams like mine.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: – and suddenly your own bad dreams
come charging back. Made worse by your chronic fear of them. Add in all
the recent campaign news about Congressman Shaw, which is obviously
rekindling your feelings of guilt and jealousy –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – I’m not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Okay. How did you feel when you
heard the news from the convention?</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: A shrug isn’t a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I felt … fine. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes. Glad for him. He deserves it. Raymond
Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest –</p>
<p><strong>marco lt. col. howard</strong>: – most selfless human being –
most selfless human being I’ve ever … you’ve ever known. Half a beat
–</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: You’re fucking with me, Major.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No sir. I wouldn’t do that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: What other conclusion can I
draw?</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Look, we’ve been over this a
million times. Until you forgive yourself for what happened that night
in Kuwait, the loss of your men – for what you did, for what you didn’t
do …</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: How’s Public Affairs?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It sucks, sir. I want to get back to
Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Then for God’s sake, Ben, go back
on your meds. And stay on them, this time. Get some sleep. I’ll see you
in two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes sir. Same time, same station.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: And stay the hell away from
television.</p>
<p><strong>63 int./ext. d.c. botanical gardens - day 63</strong>:
Festive champagne brunch. Lush indoor foliage. The Capitol Dome visible
in the b.g. Huge, graphic banners declaim the campaign slogan: SECURE
TOMORROW and the ticket: ARTHUR-</p>
<p><strong>shaw.</strong>: An elegant ALL-WOMAN HARP ORCHESTRA plays
new-age patriotic music, and a thick crowd of WEALTHY PARTY INNER CIRCLE
members jostle between elegant food stations, or cue up for thirty
seconds with presidential-hopeful Robert Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>moving with - marco</strong>: who has two retired, old
bastard Generals in his company, stars gleaming on their shoulders.
Marco’s eyes scan the room; he’s a man on a mission:</p>
<p><strong>general sloan</strong>: No offense, Major, but it chaps my
ass we gotta have a babysitter.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sir, I’m just here to keep you from getting
into fist-fights with the Navy guys.</p>
<p><strong>marco’s p.o.v. - across the huge room - raymond</strong>:
holding side-show vice-presidential court for some enamored young women
and their banker husbands. SECRET SERVICE agents, including his
everpresent Anderson, maintaining a careful perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>general wilson</strong>: Major Marco –</p>
<p><strong>marco and the generals</strong>: Marco forced to pull his
gaze away from Raymond:</p>
<p><strong>general wilson</strong>: – this Army of Two’s gonna do some
recon on the no host bar.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Right behind you, sirs.</p>
<p><strong>senator eleanor shaw</strong>: powers through with Gillespie
and a couple of our media FLAKS, giving them an earful:</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – billions of dollars, thousands of troops,
sacrificed on behalf of a disastrous foreign policy which has only
served to galvanize our enemies –</p>
<p><strong>ellie marco</strong>: Excuse us please – Whoa – FOR AN
INSTANT Ellie and Marco lock eyes – then the crowd swallows her again
–</p>
<p><strong>general wilson</strong>: They oughta put up a crossing
guard.</p>
<p><strong>general sloan</strong>: Or rig her with an air horn.</p>
<p><strong>with raymond</strong>: – distractedly staring at a pretty
young woman near the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I mean – that’s supposed to be the whole
point of this great country, isn’t it? That everybody matters. Not just
the people at this party – no offense – but the people who can’t afford
to be here.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond – – sorry to interrupt –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You must learn not to let yourself get
cornered by the bottom-feeders.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Including you?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I devour everything in my path, darling, top
or bottom, you know that.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hello Mark.</p>
<p><strong>whiting</strong>: Eleanor! Congratulations, Raymond. Your
grandad would be so goddamn proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Nice to see you Mark. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – Raymond, this is J.B. Johnston, from
Manchurian Global –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes, hi –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – and David Donovan, their Managing
Director.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – and co-chair of the U.S. International
Policy Caucus.</p>
<p><strong>donovan ellie</strong>: One and the same.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Go away, mother. You’ve earned your
fee.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The plucky idealist.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Gentlemen, how’s business?</p>
<p><strong>whiting</strong>: Good, Raymond. Business is good.</p>
<p><strong>johnston</strong>: Could always be better.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Careful. Any better, you’ll be a
monopoly.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: There’s the challenge. Maximizing the
market share and potential of a company.</p>
<p><strong>whiting</strong>: Or a country.</p>
<p><strong>across the room - marco - monets later</strong>: watches
Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global guys – while, at the
bar, the generals have established their beachhead of Bloody Marys with
a couple of younger men in NAVY WHITES:</p>
<p><strong>rear admiral glick</strong>: Every great civilization has
been anchored by a great Navy.</p>
<p><strong>general sloan</strong>: Bullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe
for some raghead with a rocket launcher to put a hole in your
bucket.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: If you can’t behave yourselves, Generals,
we’re gonna spend the rest of the day watching the Orioles game back at
the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Congressman – Sergeant Shaw –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Ben Marco.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I know. Hello Captain.</p>
<p><strong>marco raymond</strong>: It’s Major, and – But he keeps
walking –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – okay.</p>
<p><strong>ellie and jordan</strong>: locked in fierce, low battle, off
to one side, voices hard, rising out of the din:</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: – the political extortion you committed in
order to destroy my vice presidential bid so that –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tom.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: – so that you might vicariously bask in
reflected limelight from your son –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tom, please, just because the party felt a
younger, more dynamic man could help the ticket, I don’t think it’s fair
for you to single me out and –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You know, I have such contempt for you,
Eleanor, that when I think of you, I actually fear for this country.
Raymond is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at worst. But you, you are the
smiler who wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag and waits for her
chance to strike. Which I pray will never come.</p>
<p><strong>65 ext. botanical gardens - entrance - marco 65</strong>: has
found Raymond with Jocie – outside – but hangs back – overhearing
Raymond’s earnest and intense conversation with Jocie, who is slightly
uncomfortable with this but trying to make light of it –</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: … but Raymond, my God, it’s been so many
years – I’ve been married and divorced –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’ve changed too.</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: That’s not what I – but, yes, it’s great,
really – I see that you have – congratulations –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – But my feelings haven’t. Changed, I mean
…</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … I guess I’ve never stopped – feeling –
wondering – how it might have turned out, you know, between us, if –</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: Raymond – people can’t rewrite their lives
–</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Jocie, I haven’t even been with another
girl since we … stopped seeing each other – doesn’t that say something
to you?</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: That you must be just about the loneliest
person on earth, and it breaks my heart.</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: I’ve got to go – good luck with the
campaign.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sergeant Raymond Shaw –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I want to talk to you too.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – Not now.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – I know you’re busy – I just have to ask you
–</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I saw Al Melvin the other day – remember
Corporal Melvin?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Okay – sorry – but – Melvin, he’s extremely
disturbed about what happened to us, on the recon patrol, back in Kuwait
–</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Don’t ever touch me.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Tried the Pad Thai, Major? I’m told it
rules.</p>
<p><strong>close - colonel garret</strong>: tense and unsmiling.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: What were you hoping he’d say?</p>
<p><strong>66 int. pentagon - conference room - marco 66</strong>: is in
a more formal setting – Lt. Col. Howard is with COLONEL GARRET and an
enlisted soldier, a WOMAN, taking notes –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I don’t know, sir. It isn’t so much what he
said, or didn’t say – but his demeanor, his attitude. Sir, I overheard
an exchange he –</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: I think you hoped Congressman Shaw
would say, “yes, Major, I’ve had those same dreams. Tomatoes and
sandstorms. You’re not nuts, there’s some crazy shit going down
here.”</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Major, we’ve been down this road
with you before, yes?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No, sir, not this road, sir. But I hear what
you’re saying, and I want to do this through the proper channels.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Are you back on your meds?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Lt. Colonel Howard – with respect – I’ve had
a dozen years of experts telling me I’ve got Gulf War Syndrome, or a
stress disorder. Twelve years being a good soldier, denying what every
nerve ending in my body tells me is more real than not. One dream, over
and over. Not variations on a dream, the same one, night after night
after night –</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: – Your guilt and your jealousy
require you to construct this … elaborate fiction, so that you –</p>
<p><strong>marco lt. col. howard</strong>: No – – can avoid the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – No sir. Something happened to us, in the
desert, ten years ago. Not what we thought it was. And it happened on my
watch.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Have you contacted any other members
of the unit besides Shaw and Melvin? Asked them about the dreams?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Owens died of cancer in ’97. Villalobos, a
car crash. Atkins committed suicide. Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11,
body never recovered. Wilson I’m still trying to track down.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sir, I know I can’t ask you to talk to
Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it’s a phone call, a quick
q&amp;a – look at his notebooks, hear what he’s been dreaming – and
either he will support the credibility of what I’m saying, or he won’t.
And I’ll shut up.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: And what is it you are saying,
exactly, Major? That you misrepresented – falsified – what happened In
Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: If you just talk to Melvin –</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: – No, no, I’m sorry – you’re saying
an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that
Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you’re the only
one who knows the truth.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Major Marco. You will stay clear of
Congressman Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: And you will resume your meds,
Major. That is an order.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Major, do you ever take a step back
and consider why you’ve remained at rank for all these years? Missed
Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of lesser promise and
inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved
beyond you?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Every day, sir.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. stage - vice-presidential debate 67</strong>: FAVOR
Raymond, at a podium, his VICE PRESIDENTIAL OPPONENT slightly out of
focus at his identical podium in the near b.g., mid-rebuttal:</p>
<p><strong>tv67 v.p. opponent tv67</strong>: … there are still VRF
terrorists in Sierra Leone, new terrorist alliances forming in many
parts of Asia and South America – we can’t simply, suddenly relinquish
our commitment to world leaders who have stood by us.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. moderator</strong>: Congressman Shaw – your
rebuttal?</p>
<p><strong>68 int. marco’s apartment - night 68</strong>: Marco on his
phone, the t.v. blaring, under:</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Hello, Victor? Marco. How’s it goin’? Public
affairs sucks, my friend. I miss you guys. Listen, favor: guy from my
old unit, Melvin, Alfred R. – I need an</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: address on him, I think he’s here in D.C. …
yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>tv68 raymond/t.v. tv68</strong>: – but meanwhile, somebody’s
grandmother, in a small American town, is standing in her kitchen –
she’s got her medicine bottle in one hand, she’s opening the
refrigerator with the other. And she’s thinking: I can pay for my
medicine, or I can pay for my dinner. I can’t do both. In America. In
America, our mothers and grandmothers shouldn’t have to worry about
that.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I’m here …</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: There are gaps in this country. Ugly chasms
that we need to bridge …</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … the gap between rich and poor, between
government and people –</p>
<p><strong>71 int. skid row residential hotel - lobby - night
71</strong>: Marco checks a room number he’s written under an address on
a scrap of paper.</p>
<p><strong>tv71 raymond tv71</strong>: – between true security and the
notion of feeling safe …</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … between what is real and what is not.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Dontcha love this guy?</p>
<p><strong>72 int. skid row hotel corridor 72</strong>: At the far end
of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see Marco arrive at the door to
Melvin’s room. He hesitates, then knocks –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Al? Al Melvin, it’s Marco …</p>
<p><strong>73 int. fancy hotel corridor - night 73</strong>: Raymond
comes down the brightly-lit, elegant hallway, tired, trailing Anderson
and his SECRET SERVICE entourage.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … The enemy is among us. The wolf is at the
door … the fox is in the henhouse … the weasel is … the weasel is …</p>
<p><strong>74 int. raymond’s hotel suite - night 74</strong>: Anderson
and another AGENT move through the suite, securing it – Raymond losing
steam:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The weasel is a weasel. Frog and Toad Are
Friends.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Sir, we’ll be right outside.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I know. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You have thirty seconds, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>75 intercut - ellie’s senate office - night 75</strong>:
Ellie behind her desk.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Am I this predictable?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m calling to compliment you, Mr. Grumpy. I
thought you were magnificent tonight. So do all the network campaign
experts. “Presidential” was a word they used.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This compassionate vigilance thing is working
quite well for you. I might have to convert.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I happen to believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Of course you do. Now Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Goodnight, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>76 int. ellie’s senate office - night 76</strong>: Ellie
listens to the dead air of the other end of her call.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>77 int. raymond’s hotel suite - night 77</strong>: Raymond
stares –</p>
<p><strong>the phone</strong>: Mom on hold, flashing red light. The
second call, light fluttering –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: punches the line, lifts the receiver –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>voice on the phone</strong>: Sergeant Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice on the phone</strong>: Sergeant Raymond Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes …?</p>
<p><strong>voice on the phone</strong>: Raymond Prentiss Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>voice on the phone</strong>: Listen: Enter the bathroom, and
go to the closet there.</p>
<p><strong>wide - the suite</strong>: Raymond moves with tremendous
assurance across the living room and down the hallway and into the
bathroom –</p>
<p><strong>the phone</strong>: light flashing, Eleanor on HOLD – stops
–</p>
<p><strong>78 int. bathroom 78</strong>: Double sinks, walk-in shower,
and a huge closet which Raymond opens to reveal –</p>
<p><strong>79 int. closet 79</strong>: A THICK PANEL in the back wall
just being unmoored – the RUSHING ROAR of a sandstorm and –</p>
<p><strong>a man in black</strong>: steps through, gloves and soft-soled
shoes. Raymond just watching as he places a small clam-shell video
screen open on the counter – we can SEE a B&amp;W surveillance view of
the CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND’S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the night
watch, reading. The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway
–</p>
<p><strong>80 int. a huge room beside raymond’s suite - continuous
80</strong>: – where Raymond is met by TECHNICIANS in sterile gear,
surgical gloves. He’s entered some kind of portable, surreal operating
theater, filled with monitoring device and computers … a one-way
video-conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one
corner, surrounded by I.V. racks and more techno-medical equipment. The
man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital timer and turns to
face Raymond. It’s NOYLE.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Hello Raymond. Do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Brilliant. We have twenty minutes for our
little check up from the neck up.</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. pay phone - night 81</strong>: Marco on a public
phone, across the street from Melvin’s residential hotel. Shaken.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: My God. I’m sorry to hear that. When did it …
Yeah, I know. I know. Listen, Mrs. Wilson – can you tell me if Nathan
was ever – preoccupied – with his experience in Kuwait? Did he ever
mention dreams or nightmares … about what happened … the firefight,
afterward … – uh-huh. Sure. No, I understand. Thank you for –</p>
<p><strong>blink.</strong>: 82 Marco listening to the phone on the other
end of his call 82</p>
<p><strong>blink.</strong>: 83 Another call. 83</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: … no, Mr. Villalobos, I’m just – Army’s got
me running statistics on stress disorders, I’m trying to gather
information on my old squad members … yes sir –</p>
<p><strong>a84 int. noyle’s hidden hotel room - night a84</strong>:
Raymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes – a TRANSLUCENT
BOX around his face overlaid with a METRIC GRID, his head held
motionless by a semi-circular BRACE, curved calibration offering precise
positioning for a MICRO-DRILL that Noyle moves into place – and then a
long, tiny drill bit WHIRS DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very
tight across Raymond’s head – – and plunges precisely and effortlessly
through Raymond’s skull, then STOPS – he has no reaction, feels nothing
– LCD screens – show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND’S BRAIN, in a full range
of primary colors – sections morphing as thoughts and memories race
through his mind, as MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES – are threaded down
through the HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond’s
brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras:</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: No decay, no slippage. Everything appears to
be in flawless working condition. Raymond can you remember the deaths of
Mavole and Baker?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Describe it.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. skid row residential hotel - night 84</strong>: Marco
knocking at Melvin’s door again.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: … Al? You in there?</p>
<p><strong>85 int. melvin’s apartment - night 85</strong>: The light
switch doesn’t work. Click, click. Eerie shudder of neon from the sign
on the building, shapes crowd the room, claustrophobic … … Marco has a
PENLIGHT – he turns it on, sweeps in front of him with its weak beam:
THE ROOM – stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers, magazines, and
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NOTEBOOKS, covering nearly every available
surface. Marco picks up a notebook. Moves to a desk and sits. Opens the
book –</p>
<p><strong>87 omitted 87</strong>: 88 BEAM OF THE PENLIGHT aimed down at
pages filled with CRUDE 88</p>
<p><strong>– american flags –</strong>: – in the margins, many attempts
to capture likenesses of DR. NOYLE AND THE MYSTERIOUS ARABIC WOMAN,
repeatedly crossed out, never right.</p>
<p><strong>fb88 flash: dreamscape fb88</strong>: Noyle turning toward
us, eyes bright –</p>
<p><strong>resume - marco</strong>: – under the headline WHAT HAPPENED,
extremely small, cramped handwriting that goes on for pages –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … we’re heading back to forward command.
The night is clear. Stars but no moon –</p>
<p><strong>89 tight - raymond 89</strong>: The video feed from Noyle’s
hidden hotel room cameras, digital, herky-jerky:</p>
<p><strong>tv89 raymond tv89</strong>: – We’re engaged unexpectedly by
ground forces with helicopter support. In the ensuing firefight, Bobby
Baker gets himself separated to the left. Mavole goes after him …</p>
<p><strong>90 int. melvin’s room - night 90</strong>: Marco reading
these same words, which Melvin has scrawled in his journals:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: … An incoming mortar shell kills both of
them instantly, before I am able to –</p>
<p><strong>fb90 flash cut: a giant monitor fb90</strong>: Marco’s whole
squad, staring at a digital screen animation of Raymond’s one-man
military fire-fight – a CGI Hummer with a flaming tire, Raymond
heroically spewing machine gun fire at the enemy, exactly as we’ve seen
it in Marco’s retelling:</p>
<p><strong>the team</strong>: – instantly before Sergeant Shaw is able
to locate and eliminate the source of the ordnance …</p>
<p><strong>fb90a shock cut: reflected in a mirror - marco
fb90a</strong>: Strapped to a chair back in the dreamscape, head back,
his mouth pried open and a hypodermic needle plunged deep up into his
palette – thin electrode wires splayed across his face and neck –
Noyle’s just behind him –</p>
<p><strong>taped voice</strong>: … locate and eliminate the source of

<p><strong>91 int. melvin’s room - marco 91</strong>: flips compulsively
ahead through the notebook, lit by the harsh beam of the penlight.
Endless, repetitive writing. FEVERISHLY RENDERED IMPRESSIONS of the
dreamscape, medical apparatus, choppers, guns – MORE and MORE images of
Raymond Shaw – of Raymond strangling Mavole – – and A DRAWING OF A MAN
WHO MIGHT BE MARCO, unfinished, uncertain except for the eyes – Marco
with a GUN in his hand –</p>
<p><strong>fb91 flash: bobby baker fb91</strong>: – as a bullet hole is
punched in his forehead – FALLING AWAY – with a look of astonishment on
his face – blood just beginning to seep from the wound –</p>
<p><strong>resume - melvin’s room - marco</strong>: he drops the
notebook like it’s on fire –</p>
<p><strong>tight - on the floor - the notebook</strong>: – SKETCHES of
Bobby Baker with a bullet hole in his forehead –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – topples the chair as he stands up – and
then:</p>
<p><strong>the bare, overhead lightbulb in the room</strong>: shudders
to life – dies – glows again – brighter – AND</p>
<p><strong>the walls of melvin’s apartment</strong>: are COVERED with
DRAWINGS and SCRAWLINGS and newspaper clippings and patterns made with
paper plates and empty Noodle containers – the crazy patterns of the
tiles from Noyle’s dream lab – it’s as if Marco has entered the mind of
a mad man – everything from the notebooks, and more,</p>
<p><strong>92 tight - noyle 92</strong>: Pixels blown out and distorted,
streaming insanely – Noyle stares right into camera, intent:</p>
<p><strong>tv92 noyle tv92</strong>: Questions?</p>
<p><strong>93 int. bullet train to new york - day 93</strong>: Marco
sits at a window, eyes closed, head pressed to the glass, the world just
a blur beyond him. He opens his eyes,</p>
<p><strong>laurent tokar</strong>: sitting down across from him.
Smiling.</p>
<p><strong>laurent</strong>: Is this seat taken?</p>
<p><strong>94 int. bullet train to new york - day 94</strong>: Marco
opens his eyes – head pressed to a window, the world a blur beyond him –
SEES: Nothing. An empty seat opposite him. Laurent was a dream. Marco
looks around, self-conscious, and –</p>
<p><strong>through the seats - a woman’s face</strong>: staring back at
him. Not enough to tell much more than she’s pretty. Marco looks away,
out the window. Then back. She’s gone. Another dream?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Maryland’s a beautiful state.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: This is Delaware.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: I know. But, Maryland, it’s a beautiful state
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Paper or plastic.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: From the grocery store. You were wondering
where, we, you know – and right at the check-out stand, “paper or
plastic,” that’s me. I see you all the time. Bennett Marco. Checks from
the First National Bank, and you always put your spare change into the
March of Dimes thing. Romance novels, instant noodles, No-Doz and
tomatoes. Anyway, I’m on vacation, holiday in the City and so forth, I
saw you sitting here … I thought, okay, girl – it’s now or never.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: You headed to New York City?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Business?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No. Guy I knew … in the Army. He’s in
politics now. We’ve kinda lost touch. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Eugenie.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: ’Scuse me?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Yeah. Crazy French pronunciation and all.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s pretty.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I guess your friends call you Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Not yet they haven’t, thank God. But you can
call me Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What do your friends call you?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Rosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose. I’ve
always liked the Rosie part better. Eugenie is, well, fragile.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Still. When I asked you your name, you said
it was Eugenie.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Yeah. Well. Maybe ’cause I was feeling
fragile. At the time.</p>
<p><strong>fb94 flash</strong>: PFC. BOBBY BAKER – stares back at him
from where FB94</p>
<p><strong>blink.</strong>: ROSIE – as before. Slight look of
puzzlement, because – MARCO – is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the
aisle –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>95 int. train corridor - as before 95</strong>: – Marco
catches himself, hands against the bulkhead wall near the bathroom.
Another PASSENGER squeezes past him, headed in the opposite direction.
Marco tries the bathroom door. Locked. OCCUPIED.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: OW dammit –</p>
<p><strong>big man marco</strong>: Sorry. I didn’t know you It’s okay.
It’s okay. were – – Marco’s DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the
pills together and put them back in the plastic vial. The big man
goes.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: sinks down next to him. Calm. Deftly plucking
the pills from the floor.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: My mother would tell you to wash these.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: I didn’t mean to upset you.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s not you, it’s me. I’m not – my head – –
nothing’s … I wish I smoked.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: It’s way overrated.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Rosie, I’m gonna go in here, wash my face,
take my pill, and get myself together.</p>
<p><strong>96 int. train men’s room - day 96</strong>: Marco cups water
in his hands and smears it on his face, wiping it away with a paper
towel. He comes up looking in the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as –</p>
<p><strong>in the mirror: the door opens</strong>: and a man comes
partway in – now it’s Dr. Noyle. Marco pivots – no Noyle. The door is
shut, locked. He’s all alone. Losing his mind.</p>
<p><strong>97 int. train corridor - rosie 97</strong>: Lost in thought.
Faint smile. She puts her hand flat against the door, then turns and
heads back to her seat.</p>
<p><strong>98 int. train men’s room - marco 98</strong>: Turns to the
mirror again … and again SEES Dr. Noyle behind him, smiling:</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Hello Captain. Do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>99 int. train corridor - marco 99</strong>: emerges from the
bathroom to find an irritated CONDUCTOR now awkwardly trying to extract
his key from the door, and Rosie waiting.</p>
<p><strong>conductor rosie</strong>: Are you okay, sir? Ben?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: … Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Jesus. You’ve been in here twenty minutes. I
thought you’d fallen off.</p>
<p><strong>100 int. penn station - day 100</strong>: Marco comes up the
escalator, into a SEA OF COMMUTERS. Momentarily lost. Rosie is behind
him, a moment later with her bag, and –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: I’m gonna get a cab, you want me to drop you
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No. I’m okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Your friend gonna meet you here?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: El Dorado 59970. My cell phone, in case you –
you know. I like to say it the old way – can you remember the number, or
should I write it on your chest with a sharpie?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: You’re sweating.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Listen. You got a place to go and get
freshened up?</p>
<p><strong>101 int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - night 101</strong>:
Rosie lets Marco in. It’s incredibly cramped, everything in one room,
window facing a brick wall, lots of play posters.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: – It’s my cousin’s apartment. She’s in
Cleveland with the road company of ‘Mamma Mia.’ There’s … a view of the
park … if you go out on the fire escape and kinda … tilt your head …</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: I’m nervous. I’m sorry. I yak when I get
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Me, I get quiet.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Dreams, I’ve been having these –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Is that what happened on the train?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I could be dreaming you.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: What if you are?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You’d be the best dream I’ve had in a long
time, Rosie.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: If that’s a line, Ben Marco, it kinda
worked.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. bathroom - shower - marco 102</strong>: The water
cascades down on him. He feels around on his back where the door on the
train whacked him – feels something on his shoulder – a bump – CAMERA
CURLS around as he twists, contorts, can’t see it, but feels it and
–</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>tight - marco’s hand</strong>: turning off the shower, hard
–</p>
<p><strong>103 resume - rosie’s cousin’s apartment 103</strong>: She’s
sitting, watching the closed bathroom door. No noise from the
shower.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Earth to Ben – how’re you doing in there?</p>
<p><strong>104 int. bathroom - marco 104</strong>: hyper, rummaging
through the vanity, searching for – pair of cuticle scissors, tweezers,
anything sharp – a little basket of sample perfumes CRASHES into the
sink –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Ben, what’s going on – are you okay –?</p>
<p><strong>105 intercut - rosie - outside the door 105</strong>: –
Rosie’s KNOCKING HARDER, NOW.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Ben, I need you to open this door. Okay? Just
for a sec. You’re scaring me. Ben –?</p>
<p><strong>106 int. bathroom - marco 106</strong>: He SLASHES at the
lump. Blood blossoms. SLASHES again, oblivious to pain.</p>
<p><strong>ben marco!?</strong>: PUSH IN as Ben presses the blade
sharply down into his skin … cutting a slit through which the blunt edge
of</p>
<p><strong>an extremely tiny oblong thing</strong>: appears, like a
grain of rice. It slides out into Ben’s bloody fingers.</p>
<p><strong>108 marco 108</strong>: puts his trembling hand under the
faucet, grips the thing between two fingers, turns on the water –</p>
<p><strong>109 the door - rosie 109</strong>: breaks in – sees the BLOOD
smeared down Marco’s back –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – loses his grip on the oblong thing before
he can even get a good look at it, and it goes into the sink –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: SHIT. Oh no NO …</p>
<p><strong>floor level - under the sink</strong>: where he puts both
hands on the fittings of the u-joint trap and struggles to get them
loose – succeeding finally, water spewing everywhere – – the trap falls
to the floor, disgorging soap chips, slimy hairballs and pipe corrosion
and water … but not the thing he wants. It’s –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Gone. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Tell me you saw that.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You didn’t. You didn’t see it.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Proof.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: My sanity.</p>
<p><strong>110 ext. isolated warehouse - on the hudson river - day
110</strong>: Stark building with a huge parking lot and only one car
parked in it. A CAB pulls through the open gate, stops. Marco gets
out.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Implant delusions. Number three on the
paranoid top ten list.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. warehouse stairway - day 111</strong>: Ben and
RICHARD DELP ascend at a good clip. Delp wears a lab coat, trappings of
a medical researcher:</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: This wasn’t a delusion.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: That’s what they all say, Marco. Some wicked
shit got sprayed on you guys during Desert Storm. Besides all the
depleted uranium, I mean …</p>
<p><strong>112 int. delp’s research lab - sky booth - day 112</strong>:
A narrow, glassed-in space with a cluster of monitoring equipment
against the wall of darkened windows. Fluorescent lights flicker on,
revealing a CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, in which an intricate MAZE of CAGES
contains unhappy, SCREAMING research MONKEYS with Orwellian
stainless-steel hardware and antennae bolted to their bisected skulls.
Strange SOUNDS and various LIGHTING EFFECTS emerge from the different
sections.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: … I personally know of a coupla Rangers who
swear that they see only in tertiary colors now –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Delp.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: – and can pick up sports talk radio in their
cortical block if they get too close to a Con-Ed transformer.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Delp. It’s not GWS.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: A dozen years ago, the Army did this tiny
implantable I.D. thing – you could imbed it under the skin, then scan it
like a bar code for medical emergency information, blood-type, DNA.
Pentagon ordered up half a million, and stuck about five thousand
experimentally into high-risk soldiers and infantry. But the scanners
proved skittish and field hospitals hated ’em, so the whole deal got
eighty-sixed and forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: The Army never put one in me.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: That you know of, man. That you know of. How’d
you find me?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I looked under Mad Scientists in the yellow
pages – there was a full page ad.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: You seriously believe somebody’s messed with
your mother board.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What are you studying here, Delp?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Fear.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: For the Agency?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Nah, CIA cut me loose in ’97 during the
Macedonian debacle. Now I got this little grant from Wal-Mart.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Look, Delp. My experiences during the war, in
Kuwait … feel dreamlike to me. And my dreams? About what happened? Feel
as real as you and me, here, right now.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s like … I feel like somewhere along the
line, I’ve been … brainwashed. Or something. You know? All scrambled
up.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: We’ve all been brainwashed, Marco. Religion,
advertising, television. Politics. We accept what’s normal because we’re
told it’s normal and we crave normalcy. Hell, look at the Germans under
Hitler. Disco, in the seventies. And if you’re really worried about
somebody imbedding electric probes and computer chips in your brain to
make you do things – it’s horseshit, man. Turns out Pavlov had it right
from the getgo. Dogs and all. A little ECT and sleep deprivation will do
the trick for a fraction of the price. Ask the Uzbeks. And you would
remember it.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What about my dreams?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: What if all this is the fucking dream and
you’re still back in Kuwait?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You’re not helping me.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: I am. You’re not helping yourself. Reality is
consensual, man. You just gotta prove it up. Or play it out.</p>

attack on this country from a secret alliance of rogue states is certain

FREEMAN sit facing them, talking low, on a cell phone, as:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I saw Mavole’s Mom and Dad in St. Louis. I
still visit them – and Baker’s mom – when I can. Do you keep up with
anybody from the unit besides Al Melvin?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I don’t keep up with Al Melvin. He found
me.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Why did you ask me about Kuwait?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I didn’t. I asked you about your dreams. At
the fundraiser – why did you say you needed to talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>mirella</strong>: Mr. Shaw, excuse me – they want to know if
you’ll do an interview with Larry King at six.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. What do you want from me, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Major. Forty minutes of your time.</p>
<p><strong>mirella</strong>: No to the interview, or no to six?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: He wants to talk about my mother. No.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Private time.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Well, we’ve got about five minutes, right
now. And this is as private as it gets for me anymore, so …</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: There are these dreams that … some of the men
in our unit have been having.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Including you?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s a question of what actually happened the
night our patrol was attacked –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: That’s easy. RPG incoming. Mortar fire,
we’re ambushed. Total chaos. I can’t locate Baker or Mavole. You’re
knocked unconscious – I find you and pull you to safety and then –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Yeah, that’s how I remember it, too. But I
dream something else.</p>

118</strong>: Through the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone
volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW logo looms
above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw.
Anderson comes out and opens the limo door for Raymond. Marco struggles
out behind him:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Am I in your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – You know.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Saving everybody?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s more complicated than that.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: People just don’t have the same dreams
accidentally – – Melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed,
this is one of his notebooks – it’s all in here.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t have dreams, Captain. Maybe you
should … see somebody – talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of
thing –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’ve been to doctors.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Okay. Okay, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’m not crazy, Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Captain – – Major. Ben.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>119 int. raymond’s private office - campaign hq - dusk
119</strong>: Huge posters featuring Raymond’s face, emblazoned with
SECURE TOMORROW, stacked against the wall. A desk covered with papers
and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people, and Raymond sits behind
it, nursing a glass of wine, and pointedly ignoring Melvin’s notebook,
while:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I kill Mavole?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s a dream –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – could mean something else.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – could be I’m just supposed to think you
did.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – I killed the enemy. I didn’t know them,
either. So it was okay. And, anyway, I remember what we did in Kuwait, I
remember it perfectly. But now that you mention it, I don’t remember
doing it … exactly.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Maybe you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: NO. What a thought.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Life is so bizarre, isn’t it? This absurd
campaign, the sordid world of politics, my whole public life and persona
– sometimes, occasionally, for an instant, the fog clears and I look and
I think, what am I doing? I mean, what the fuck am I doing? Posing and
grinning like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands with total strangers
who must be blind if</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: they can’t see what I am, at the core. What
my mother has made me.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: A Prentiss. Ferociously, a Prentiss – but
not a Shaw, God forbid – I was molded by cold hard hands, every detail
of my existence preordained. Can you even imagine, Ben, how it would
feel never to have a say in what your life would be? I was twenty years
old before I had a friend – no, worse, a girlfriend – well, almost –
but, yes, a friend, or I thought so – outside my mother’s circle of
approved encounters – and it didn’t – she wouldn’t – precipitating my
one act of rebellion, storming off and enlisting – – in the Army. Which,
ironically, only served ultimately to pad my gilded Prentiss resume. You
know: “fluent in five languages, Phi Beta Kappa, Congressional Medal of
Honor, blah blah blah.” And after the war I came back to her. And the
family legacy. This. Mother calls it, “fulfilling my Manifest Prentiss
Destiny.”</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Why did you come back, Raymond? What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Weren’t you listening? Mother happened. You
know, the truth is, I hate it. I’ve always despised it.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Which?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The medal. The cloying adulation of the
little people. Your pitiful jealousy –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Who said I was jealous?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t have the dreams, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How can you not remember saving the unit?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I do. I said I did.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You said you don’t remember doing it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Ha ha, don’t mix me up, I’m tired, and –
Fine. It’s like this. It’s as if I know what will happen, Ben, but I
never get to the part where I feel that it actually did happen. But I
think that’s probably perfectly normal.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Did you ever talk to anybody about this
little discrepancy?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What? No. Who would I ask? My old Army
“buddies,” who love and adore me for saving their pathetically
unimportant – present company excluded – asses?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No. You ask Army Intelligence. Look, we can
go together, tomorrow. You tell them what you just told me, everything
you do remember, what you don’t “exactly” remember, about Kuwait, let
’em run some tests on you –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m sure the press would have a field day
with that.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Raymond. They put an implant in me. I found
it yesterday. Maybe they put one in you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Nobody’s put anything in me.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Great. Let’s prove it. We can go get an x-ray
– we can check it right now –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I want to be supportive of you, Ben, I do,
but –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Just check your back, Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – this can wait until after the
election.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What are you afraid of? See if there’s a
bump.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You should leave. This is not, this is not
–</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – just check –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: There’s nothing there!</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Somebody was in your head, with big steel-
toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw, and they went to
town! Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired, brain cells obliterated
–</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Congressman Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – you don’t even know what they did! You
don’t – you can’t CONCEIVE what they did to you – and you’re worried
about some lame-ass reporters!?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: If I’m wrong they can put me the fuck away
–</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: – are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Ben –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – there – there’s – something –</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: He bit him. Sir, did he bite you?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Sir –</p>
<p><strong>nothing happened!</strong>: Horrified campaign workers crane
necks to see inside. Mute with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from
his back. Hides the blood.</p>
<p><strong>a121 ext. manhattan - statue of liberty - day a121</strong>:
The giant lady is gilded by sunlight, virgin and unapproachable.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You want to help him?</p>
<p><strong>121 int. elegant manhattan restaurant - private room - day
121</strong>: Raymond and Ellie. Through the wavy glass we see a crowded
dining room, the ever-present Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. That’d be political suicide. Of course
not. I want you to help him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can’t even imagine why.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Because I feel sorry for him. Because I
said I would.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What should we do? Make him a General?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Mother. Look. My campaign people are
getting a restraining order, he’s going on all the security watch-lists
– but I won’t lock him up. I’m not pressing charges.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s complicated – I don’t know. It’s just
complicated and I don’t want to talk about it, I want to get back to the
campaign and focus on –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You don’t actually believe his story?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No. But he does. And he’s a fine soldier
and … my friend. And if his slim hold on sanity requires that I tolerate
his delusions until he can get help, I’ll do it. It doesn’t diminish me.
And I’m not afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: This is why voters love you. Your humanity
and everything. I’ve never projected humanity.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes I think telling people you want to
“round up all the towelheads and throw</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: them in a deep pit” probably tips your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That was a joke, you dreadful boy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Carpetbag steak.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Stuffed. With oysters?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The steak part is mostly for you. Doesn’t it
look yummy?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: My God. In the world’s literature of food
could there possibly be a more vulgar dish?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And eating it is an absolute sexual
experience. Try some.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Promise me that you’ll help him.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, Raymond, how much do you really know
about your friend?</p>
<p><strong>122 ext. federal building - day 122</strong>: Establishing
–</p>
<p><strong>photographs - scene photos - al melvin’s dead body</strong>:
being pulled from the chilly waters of the Potomac. Some clinical
AUTOPSY glossies.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Al Melvin …</p>
<p><strong>123 int. federal building - conference room - day
123</strong>: Marco stares, troubled and sad, at bleak photographs of Al
Melvin’s bloated, waterlogged corpse.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I went to talk to him. But he wasn’t
there.</p>
<p><strong>agent goldring</strong>: Talk about what?</p>
<p><strong>agent goldring</strong>: Dreams?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah, there are hundreds more of those in his
apartment. Did your people check out his place –?</p>
<p><strong>agent jonas</strong>: Colonel Garret kindly showed us the
file on you, Marco, you’re the shit: Special Forces. Rangers. Delta.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I wanted to talk to Corporal Melvin about
some unanswered questions involving our reconnaissance mission in
Kuwait, back in</p>
<p><strong>agent jonas</strong>: And he wasn’t there, so, what – you
thought it’d be okay to break in and wait for him?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I know this game. Will you explain to them
that I know this game?</p>
<p><strong>agent ramirez</strong>: Oh right. Army Intelligence. Isn’t
that an oxymoron?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah. Kinda like ‘special agent.’</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Cut it out, Major.</p>
<p><strong>agent goldring</strong>: What’s your obsession with Raymond
Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>agent ramirez</strong>: Man of his dreams.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Listen, you might want to advise your ME to
check for an implant in Corporal Melvin’s back – under the skin, just
shy of the scapula, left side … if he’s not looking for it, he won’t
find it.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I didn’t have anything to do with Corporal
Melvin’s death.</p>
<p><strong>agent jonas</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s your opinion, but
judging from your file here, apparently you don’t know your shit from
your oatmeal, my friend –</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Get this man out of here.</p>
<p><strong>agent jonas</strong>: Go ahead, nutball. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>agent jonas</strong>: – He hit me! Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: He said I could.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Okay, OKAY –! That’s enough.
Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major Marco. Now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Evidently this has been going on for years
…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … Sad little Tin Soldier.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. elegant restaurant - private room - day
124</strong>: Ellie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco’s extensive
file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological profiling, FBI
updates. Repeated buzzwords like: “mentally unstable,” “obsessed with
Raymond Shaw,” “delusional,” “borderline functional,” “acute stress
disorder …”</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Isn’t it disgraceful the way troubled
individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until
something horrible happens? Another failure of the HMOs. I’m thinking of
sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman of Rhode Island –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, imagine how terrified your people were
yesterday when Major Marco showed up at the airport and you invited him
– my God, invited him – to tag along. Knowing what they knew.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I know him. I served under him. He was a
good man.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That’s what the neighbors always say about
serial killers.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a
less stressful posting. Somewhere tropical.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. federal building - conference room - day
125</strong>: Marco with Howard, who’s visibly upset. He likes Marco, it
breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent Volk remains
in her chair, on the other side of the room: The door opens, and Col.
Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal
effects, and:</p>
<p><strong>agent goldring</strong>: Goodbye. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: He’s free to go?</p>
<p><strong>agent goldring</strong>: Shaw won’t press charges, and he’s
got juice with important friends. It’s today’s daily double.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Someone from Senator Eleanor Shaw’s
office called and intervened on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>colonel garret</strong>: Major, you have reached the terminal
end of the Army’s patience. You’re relieved of duty, effective
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: There’s a young neurologist at
Walter Reed. Zahn. He’s had considerable success with GWS – I want you
to get your affairs in order and report to him</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: for evaluation and treatment first
thing Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sir, I know all about Dr. Zahn. Remember?
He’s that guy who – Sir. Yes sir. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. howard</strong>: Me too, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>127 series of x-rays 127</strong>: micro-circuitry, neat as a
pin –</p>
<p><strong>delp’s voice</strong>: I thought you said you lost this.</p>
<p><strong>tight - through a stereoscopic microscope - the
implant</strong>: falls into focus, smooth and etched with integrated
circuits as intricate and beautiful as a henna tattoo …</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: I found it again.</p>
<p><strong>128 int. delp’s lab - skybooth - night 128</strong>: Delp
looks up from the microscope, at Marco.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: These are not supposed to exist, man. These
are only theoretical.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. delp’s lab - main floor - moments later
129</strong>: Delp freaked and hyper, gathering wires and whatnot from
shelves – a veritable armload, as:</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: You sure you want to do this man?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: – because I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’ll owe you one.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: sits on one of the experimental gurneys,
using a pen to write on his arm.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: No. I’ll still owe you for getting my sorry
ass out of Albania.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – Talk to me about the implant.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Manchurian Global. Heard of ’em? Private
equity fund, specializes in military support services and weapons
research … including a certain Army implant project that went belly-up
in the early 90s.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You said the Army implants were for medical
emergency data.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: The ones they publicized were. But, oh man,
there was a parallel project of all kinds of scary implantable shit the
Clinton watchdogs finally freaked out over, and closed down.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: Cuz they funded me to make some of their scary
shit.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What does it do?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t want to know. You don’t
want to know – shit – it’s out of you, and you’re still alive. That’s
the good news. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>intercut - marco’s forearm</strong>: He’s scrawling words on
his palm, with a ballpoint pen:</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Back-up in case this makes me forget some
stuff I want to remember.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: eases Marco back on the gurney, deftly puts
some I.V. taps into his arms. Marco’s legs hang over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: These are built for monkeys, so bear with me,
man.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: He’s putting thread-thin electrodes
INTO Marco’s head, just beneath the skin.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: I’m putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol
to take the edge off.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Edge off what?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: ‘Getting clarity.’ Or whatever you want to
call it – ECT not being the precise science that, say, leeching is.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You don’t think this is going to work.</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: It’s the desperation move, man. But, hey.
There is a school of thought, says a victim of induced abreaction – or
ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if you’re at all correct about what
happened to you – can have it effectively dispersed by electroshock.
Unscrambled.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – But?</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: But the legions of naysayers will tell you
that if the initial work’s done correctly – if the brain’s been not just
washed, but dry-cleaned –</p>
<p><strong>delp</strong>: – fuhgetaboutit. No sale. Try to relax,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>images fade in and out:</strong>: FB129 – a man in a gas mask
JAMS his rifle butt down. FADE FB129</p>
<p><strong>out.</strong>: FBA129– black-clad soldiers swarm Marco’s
team. FADE OUT. FBA129 FBB129– inside of a helicopter, grey light
fluttering – FBB129 FBC129– jetting low across dark water as dawn
breaks. FADE FBC129</p>
<p><strong>out.</strong>: FBD129– impression of an abandoned village –
FBD129 FBE129– an abandoned beach – FBE129 FBF129– ruins of an ancient
caravansary – FBF129 FBG129– float DOWN on the upturned face of NOYLE.
FADE OUT. FBG129 FBH129– Marco’s HEAD SLAMMED DOWN, hard surface, a
gun-like FBH129 FBI129– impressions of Melvin, Baker, Mavole, drugged,
wired FBI129 FBJ129– Raymond releasing Mavole’s throat – FBJ129 FBK129–
Bobby Baker, bloody hole in his forehead, falling FBK129 FBL129– the
crazy pattern of the tile – FBL129 FBM129– and Marco running, RUSHING
FORWARD – toward daylight, FBM129 FBN129– breaking outside, a glimpse of
the azure sea waiting FBN129 FBO129– stumbling from helicopters into a
rotor-torn FBO129</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. central park - day 130</strong>: Marco opens his
eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun, surreal colors: blue sky,
shimmering green, the skyline. His head is in Rosie’s lap, he lies
curled in the grass. A banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in
tight circles overhead.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Blank again?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: He said this would happen.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Your friend.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I don’t remember a friend.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Kind of like a computer system crash – your
brain goes down, then you boot up again, but you lose all your RAM. Do
you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Eugenie Rose.</p>
<p><strong>screen goes black.</strong>: Silence. Two beats. Then the
SOUND OF A TELEVISION fades up:</p>
<p><strong>tv130 newscaster #3 tv130</strong>: U.S. planes bombed
selected sites in Guinea today, acting on intelligence that the African
nation’s military regime had secretly resumed its chemical weapons
program …</p>
<p><strong>131 tight - a television 131</strong>: 131A Campaign footage
of Raymond Shaw visiting schools in the 131A 131B inner city, Arthur
riding horses in Wyoming, the two men 131B 131C meeting with business
leaders in Chicago. 131C</p>
<p><strong>tv131 newscaster #4 tv131</strong>: … latest USA Today polls

Raymond Shaw. The duo holds a commanding lead, entering the last two
weeks of the campaign …</p>
<p><strong>132 int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - night 132</strong>:
Marco wakes up, still in a bed. Alone. The room bathed in blue light
from the small television where the news drones.</p>
<p><strong>tv132 omitted tv132</strong>: Rosie comes out of the
bathroom, wearing a long New York Rangers jersey, bare-legged, barefoot,
hair wet from a shower. Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: It’s Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Central Park was Monday. I came home
Friday.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How did I get here?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: You called me.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: El Dorado 59970. I remembered. I remember,
and I didn’t dream.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: It’s been weird, talking to you. Knowing that
you could fall asleep with your eyes open and wake up and have forgotten
the whole conversation. I hope to God that part’s over.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What’d we talk about?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Stuff. You said you “loved” me. Not to scare
you. Out of nowhere, but more than once.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What else did we talk about?</p>
<p><strong>screen goes black.</strong>: Two beats of silence, then –</p>
<p><strong>133 int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - bedroom - dawn
133</strong>: Marco wakes up. Clear headed. Calm. Rosie is asleep beside
him on the bed. The television is off.</p>
<p><strong>134 int. bathroom - dawn 134</strong>: Marco drinks water
from the faucet, wipes his mouth. Stares at himself in the mirror – he
looks like death warmed over. Starts to smile … … but his eyes stray up
to the half-open mirror of the vanity – reflecting, behind him, the
bathroom wall: towel racks, wall paper, a high VENT … with a FAINT RED
LED glowing INSIDE.</p>
<p><strong>jump cut: marco</strong>: Standing on the edge of the tub,
stretched out, face pressed up to the vent, trying to see inside –</p>
<p><strong>subjective: marco - through the vent</strong>: Looking back
at Marco, peering in. Slightly warped by the lens. Freaking out.</p>
<p><strong>resume - marco</strong>: He can just make out the shadow of a
TINY VIDEO CAMERA, wires snaking back into the ducting, micro-lens
adjusting automatically to focus.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - dawn 135</strong>:
Marco taping newspapers over all the heating vents –</p>
<p><strong>int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - dawn</strong>: Marco going
through cupboard, drawers, closets, looking for … what, exactly? He
doesn’t know. His world is caving in. He pivots, looks at Rosie, still
sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - dawn</strong>: Rosie’s
purse is dumped out on the table, and now Marco’s going through her
suitcase. He’s dressed, now, even has his coat on. Pulling out her
clothing, discovering, at the bottom:</p>
<p><strong>file folders, notes, reports</strong>: Much of the same
material that Eleanor Shaw showed Raymond. Incriminating stuff about
Marco, timetables, surveillance photographs, psychiatric evaluations
and</p>
<p><strong>audio tapes</strong>: Microcassettes, neatly labelled with
dates and hours …</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Ben?</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: What are you … oh God.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: You’re part of it.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Don’t do this, Ben. It’s not what you
think.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How can you know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>they fight</strong>: Rosie can’t beat him, but she’s
extremely skilled – Marco gets stung twice by hard rights – but whirls,
all-defense, an improvised rope-a-dope that gives him the opening he
needs – – he SMACKS Rosie sharply, stunning her – and as she rocks
backward he flies out the door –</p>
<p><strong>136 ext. apartment building - dawn 136</strong>: Marco bursts
out of the doorway, into the grey light of morning, and runs, the files
fluttering under his arm.</p>
<p><strong>138 int. skybooth of delp’s lab - day 138</strong>: A
CARETAKER rattling keys impatiently behind him, Marco stands looking
down into the pit of the abandoned lab. Delp and the monkeys are gone.
Empty cages and unplugged equipment are all that remain of Delp and his
fear project. The utter quiet is deafening.</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. new york streets - day 139</strong>: Marco moving,
head down, eyes everywhere – anybody could be following him. Anybody
could be watching him. Anybody could be part of this. PRELAP sound of a
tape fast-forwarding and:</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: You said you “loved” me …</p>
<p><strong>141 tight - a microfiche screen 141</strong>: scrolling old
newspapers in a BLUR.</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: … Not to scare you. Out of nowhere,
but more than once.</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>142 int. new york public library - deep in the stacks - day
142</strong>: Marco deep in research, at a small table covered with
books and paper – a crazy man’s kind of chaos. The file he stole from
Rosie’s is disemboweled across the desktop. A library tape machine plays
one of the surveillance tapes he’s stolen from Rosie’s:</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: What else did we talk about?</p>
<p><strong>intercut - microfiche</strong>: stories flip past …</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: Raymond Shaw. And about what happened
to you, after you were captured. Black helicopters, secret laboratories,
mind drugs, mad scientists, shock-torture …</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: You don’t believe any of it.</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: It’s crazy. It sounds crazy.</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: – maybe that’s what they want. Maybe
that’s what they want.</p>
<p><strong>intercut - tape machine</strong>: 143 Marco pops out one
tape, pushes in another. WHIR of the 143</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: – I watched Raymond Shaw kill
someone. I watched him kill Private Eddie Mavole. Like it was
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>fb143 flashback: rosie’s apartment fb143</strong>: Marco, on
the bed, numb.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: And I think they made me kill someone too.
One of my people. Kid named Bobby Baker.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Or they want you to think that you did.</p>
<p><strong>144 resume - library 144</strong>: Marco takes his thumb off
the shuttle button and –</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: … We were all hooked up to IV tubes
and wires and equipment – heart monitors, head monitors, electroshock –
and a lot of stuff I’ve never seen before …</p>
<p><strong>manchurian hopes new implants save lives</strong>: … and a
p.r. PHOTO of Managing Director David R. Donovan, smiling, flanked by a
TEAM OF SCIENTISTS. The caption only mentions Donovan by name – in the
picture his hand is extended, he’s got a tiny implant device cupped in
his palm.</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: Did he have a name?</p>
<p><strong>marco’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>panning tight - across the scientists</strong>: in the b.g.
of the photograph. HOLDING on one, half-hidden, just slightly out of
focus. It’s Noyle.</p>
<p><strong>rosie’s voice</strong>: The doctor, Ben – what was his name?
Can you remember?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Noyle. They called him Dr. Noyle.</p>
<p><strong>145 tight - computer station - another section of the library
145</strong>: A Google search. Marco types the name: NOYLE.</p>
<p><strong>intercut - computer screen</strong>: A GOVERNMENT
website:</p>

Thumbnail photos of “25 SCIENTISTS ACCUSED OF HUMAN</p>
<p><strong>experimentation on political prisoners.”</strong>: SCROLLING
DOWN … UNTIL a photo of Atticus Noyle is center- screen. Smiling out at
us.</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: HEADLINES – “Capetown U. Scientist Expelled:
Alleged CIA Ties” – “Genome Researcher Sought for Questioning by The
Hague” – ON MARCO – energized by what he’s seeing –</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: SLIDE OVER NOYLE’S FACE – key words like
“genetic memory enhancement,” “behavioral modification” … a QUICKTIME
VIDEO that Marco activates, and –</p>
<p><strong>146 in streaming video: noyle 146</strong>: His sanitized,
early sales pitch, all digitized and degraded – an old web
interview:</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: … we really can reinvent ourselves, you know,
by the remapping of the human genome. Strengthen character, enhance
personality, not unlike tummy tucks and breast augmentation. Generate
extraordinary abilities in math, music, athletics. Tweak the sympathy
gene, boost self-confidence –</p>
<p><strong>close - on marco</strong>: staring, excited – the freak from
his nightmares is real –</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: – broaden the very parameters of memory, to
offset the ravages of dementia – or virtually liberate an individual
from the limitations imposed by damaging previous experiences –
literally freeing them from the burden of their past …</p>
<p><strong>147 ext. penn station - day 147</strong>: Raining, hard.
Marco hurrying toward the station entrance, his research jammed under
his arm, and in a grocery bag he’s found somewhere. Collides with a guy
in a suit. Papers go everywhere – Marco YELLS at the guy and scrambles
to pick up his documents, shoving people out of the way –</p>
<p><strong>series of still surveillance photos - same</strong>: Marco
scrambling to get his stuff back together. He looks like a crazy street
person.</p>
<p><strong>148 ext. washington d.c. - capitol hill - dusk 148</strong>:
A sun throws yellow across the Mall, and the Senate Office buildings are
ribboned with shadows.</p>
<p><strong>149 int. senator jordan’s office - dusk 149</strong>: Jordan
behind his desk, staring at a white business card while a high-strung
AIDE leans in, talking low:</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: I called the Pentagon. They told me he’s on
medical leave.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Secret Service, they’ve got him on a couple of
their watch and observe lists.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: I guess there’s been some trouble with this
guy, involving Congressman Shaw.</p>
<p><strong>150 int. small conference room - dusk 150</strong>: Jordan
sits behind the table, all of Marco’s documents and evidence arranged
tidily in front of him in meager piles, Marco pacing, watching as Jordan
finishes examining a thick Atticus Noyle computer print out.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Nobody will believe this.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Nobody believed Watergate.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Or Oklahoma City, or the World Trade Center.
You wouldn’t have believed Oswald before Kennedy got shot.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: On the advisory board of Manchurian- Global,
should they ever publish a list – which they won’t – you would find
former Presidents, deposed Kings, retired Prime Ministers, Ayatollahs,
African War-Lords, fallen Communist Dictators and an assortment of the
Fucking Rich, who are distinguished from the merely Filthy Rich by
factors of billions.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You bring me rumors and conjecture.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I started with nightmares, sir. Rumors and
conjecture are a giant leap forward.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Nightmares you’ve interpreted, using as your
spotty memory, the internet – sacred sanctuary of random faces and
coincidences, and evidence you chewed out of a man’s back – all neatly
stitched together with the common thread of a powerful, well-connected
private equity fund – who will plead ignorance, and be shocked, shocked,
to learn what</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: some of their subsidiary partners are
engaged in.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Sir, I don’t give a rat’s ass about
Manchurian Global! That’s not why I’m here! I can’t touch them, I get
that, I’m not stupid, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I just want to try and stop this one thing –
this Raymond Shaw bomb – from going off.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: And I’d be lying if I told you I hadn’t
factored in huge that you’ve got a vested personal, political, and
patriotic interest in how this shakes out.</p>
<p><strong>152 ext. eleanor’s virginia mansion - night 152</strong>: A
limousine pulls up in front, followed by a car full of Secret Service.
Anderson floats out and opens the door for Raymond …</p>
<p><strong>153 int. prentiss mansion - night 153</strong>: An argument
in progress as Raymond shrugs off his overcoat into the hands of a
SERVANT. The low murmur of Jordan’s voice, then INCREDULOUS
LAUGHTER:</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Lies. Fabrications. Fiction. You’ve been
waiting to do this to me for, what, twenty years? Get out.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: No, I’ll wait until Raymond gets here and we
can all –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Get out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>154 int. study - continuous 154</strong>: Raymond entering,
closing the door behind him as Ellie throws documents across the room at
Jordan:</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The man is insane, Tom – full-blown
schizophrenia – he’s been stalking Raymond – if you dare to use this
–</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Your bipolar buddy has been sharing his
dreams with Senator Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Hello Raymond.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Hello Senator. How’s Jocie?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Can we please not go down that road?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Do you recognize this man?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: His name is Atticus Noyle. He is a South
African physician, neuropsychiatric scientist and mercenary – someone
our CIA trained for covert mind warfare against the Soviets in
Aghanistan – someone who has sold technology to and done research for
terrorist groups, and rogue states. Major Marco claims that this man
–</p>
<p><strong>ellie jordan</strong>: – brainwashed you –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Sir, Ben Marco is sick. Delusional.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Nevertheless he’s pulled from his mad hat
some remarkably lucid connections between his dreams of your exploits in
Kuwait, and this Dr. Noyle, and the private equity fund Manchurian
Global –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: – your mother’s primary political benefactor
for the past fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Christ, Tom. They contribute to half the
Senate, for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: At the time of Desert Storm, Dr. Atticus
Noyle was working under a research grant from Manchurian Global. Your
mother’s friend.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Rogue scientists. Mind control. Manchurian
Global. Your mother. You. Connect the dots, Raymond. Possibly, your
mother’s blind to them, because they pay their way –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Possibly the Senator’s motives are colored by
his desperation to get himself back on the presidential ticket now that
the heavy lifting is done –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t – I don’t –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: It’s not about me. As far as I’m concerned,
this should never come out – it would shred what little remains of the
fabric of our public trust – think of the nation –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t have the dreams.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He can’t prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Everything you stand for is upside down! If
this were to come out, true or no, it would be catastrophic for the
campaign. And it will come out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: You withdraw. You bow out gracefully.
Personal reasons. An obscure illness. Yield your spot on the ticket, go
into seclusion …</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: … and then surrender yourself to federal
authorities who can help you address the damage that may have been
inflicted on you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I feel sick. Christ. What have you done to
me?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond, remember when –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: NO, never mind – don’t bother. Don’t lie.
Don’t say anything. No more lies.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I can promise you that whatever you’ve
done, I will undo it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I know – I know, baby –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I never want to see you or speak to you
again –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – I mean it this time.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sergeant Shaw –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – Sergeant Raymond Shaw –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Raymond Prentiss Shaw – Listen:</p>
<p><strong>155 int. union station - washington d.c. - dawn 155</strong>:
Marco jolts awake, as if from a bad dream, startled – cramped on a
bench, just another rumpled, weary traveler – early morning commuters
gliding past him like a fog.</p>
<p><strong>156 ext. chesapeake bay - jordan’s house - dawn 156</strong>:
A lacy fog rising from the reeds on the shoreline as the Senator drags
his kayak from under the pilings of a pristine, clapboard cottage to the
edge of the water.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. jordan’s house - dawn 157</strong>: The house is
beautiful, everything perfect. FLOAT through FINDING Jocie in a back
bedroom, waking slowly in a huge bed, rolling to look out the window and
watch her father, in his kayak, paddling away …</p>
<p><strong>158 int. union station - washington d.c. - dawn 158</strong>:
Marco grabs a coffee from off a Starbucks counter, picks up his bag and
heads toward the New York City line platform, to catch his train –</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. chesapeake bay - jordan’s kayak - day 159</strong>:
The Senator rows with confidence, his bow cuts the glassy surface of the
bay, fog ripples away from him, dreamy. Up ahead, he can see the ghost
of his house. And a figure on the shoreline.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It’s me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: stops paddling, and lets the kayak drift in.
He’s breaking hard, sweat glistening on his face.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: sloshes down into the water, wades out
waist-deep –</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: Wait. Oh, don’t do that, I can –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I came to apologize, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: – the water must be freezing. What are you
doing? Raymond. Don’t bother, I can –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jordan</strong>: I am too. But, your mother must –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>160 under the water - jordan 160</strong>: flailing – trying
to get out of the kayak, incapacitated by the cold water –</p>
<p><strong>161 int. jordan’s house - dawn 161</strong>: Jocie wanders,
sleepy, into the main room, pulling on a hooded sweatshirt – and SEES,
THROUGH THE BAY WINDOWS: – her father’s upended kayak. – a figure in the
water, as if trying to save him –</p>
<p><strong>162 ext. jordan’s house - dawn 162</strong>: Jocie sprints
down toward the water, screaming –</p>
<p><strong>daddy!</strong>: – Raymond turns and sees her running toward
him. For a moment time stands still – Jocie trying to process Raymond
Shaw in the water with her father, and Raymond trying to process,
through the curtain of his fractured consciousness, Jocelyn Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: leaps into the water, thinking she’ll help
with a rescue. The cold hits her like a sledgehammer – followed by the
realization Raymond’s trying to drown her father –</p>
<p><strong>jocelyn</strong>: Raymond, what are you doing?! No! Stop it!
Stop –!</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: turns, grabs her by the hood of her
sweatshirt – – and whipsaws her out into the deeper water, shoving her
under it. Jocelyn’s hands claw at him, but he’s stronger, and the water
has no effect on him. She thrashes wildly … and he looks down at her
through the water, hair flowing, utterly beautiful … as if in a
dream.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Shhhhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>163 news coverage - later - same day 163</strong>: TVA163Cold
tapestry of images behind the MAJOR MEDIA ICON: TVA163</p>
<p><strong>tv163 media icon tv163</strong>: … the five-term Senator –
and recent front-runner for his party’s vice presidential nomination –
appears to have accidentally drowned when his kayak overturned near his
Chesapeake Bay home. Police say his daughter, Jocelyn, 35, may have been
trying to rescue Jordan when she was, herself, overcome by the icy water
…</p>
<p><strong>164 campaign coverage 164</strong>: an impromptu stand-up
with visibly-shaken presidential candidate Arthur outside ARTHUR-SHAW
campaign headquarters:</p>
<p><strong>tv164 arthur tv164</strong>: Horrible, horrible thing.
Senator Jordan was a statesman of the highest integrity. Tom Jordan was
a friend. A damn fine man. A great American.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. penn station - manhattan - marco 165</strong>:
staring numbly at the news report on a little portable t.v. in a NEWS
KIOSK –</p>
<p><strong>166 int. campaign rally - day 166</strong>: SLOWING MOTION:
the world a blur around Raymond as he walks a gauntlet of reporters
shouting questions: about policy, about Jordan. Expressionless, he just
keeps walking, but his lips move – – “tragedy” – “senseless” – “great
loss” –</p>
<p><strong>167 ext. grounds of ellie’s mansion - day 167</strong>:
Donovan walking beside Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw. Whiting just
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You trusted us to bring your son back to
you, and we deliver. We trusted you with our technology – and now you
turn him into a common hit man.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh, don’t lecture me –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: You didn’t even ask us. You needed to
ask.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tom Jordan was going to destroy everything
we’ve worked toward, and every one of us along with it, and you want me
to call a meeting?</p>
<p><strong>whiting</strong>: David, if Jordan had gone public –</p>
<p><strong>donovan</strong>: In any endeavor, there are key players and
role players, and Raymond – or you, or me, for that matter – I’m sorry –
we are role players, with fixed values and fixed agendas, that get
weighed against other factors.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Bullshit. You can tell yourself that as you
go to bed tonight, David, and I hope it helps you wake up tomorrow with
a clean conscience – but we are talking about my son and the future of
this country. My father, Tyler Prentiss, never asked. He just did what
needed to be done.</p>
<p><strong>168 int. rosie’s cousin’s apartment - night 168</strong>:
Rosie asleep. PUSH IN RAPIDLY … then a HAND comes down hard and
efficiently against her throat – – she wakes up, fighting for air –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How does the President die?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: When. Where. How.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’m gonna stop this. We’ll go to the Feds.
You and me. And tell them a story.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Who’ll – believe –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t care any more. It’s all
I have.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: comes up holding a 9 mm revolver to Marco’s
forehead.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: I am the Feds.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: We’ve been watching you, trying to sort this
out. I mean, it’s either you’re telling it straight and we’ve all got
something big-time to worry about, or you’re crazy and dangerous –
either way we’ve had to keep you on a short leash, ’cuz if we lock you
up we’ll never know. And we can’t tell anybody because we don’t know how
deep this river runs. If there is a river. You got away from me.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Raymond Shaw murdered Senator Jordan and his
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Oh Ben. The thing is? I want to believe you.
God help me, Ben, I do.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: – he’s a time bomb, ticking –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Everybody else wants you junked up on
Thorazine and just not a problem any more.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I am clearer on this than I’ve ever been.
It’s rich guys, funding bad science, to put a sleeper in the White House
–</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Listen to yourself. You’re a poster boy for
paranoid fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I screwed up. Jordan was my trump card, and I
screwed it up. Either help me, or shoot me, Rosie. There’s no middle
ground anymore.</p>
<p><strong>169 noyle 169</strong>: frowning –</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Raymond – Raymond –</p>
<p><strong>dreamscape - as before</strong>: Raymond hands a service
revolver past Noyle, to MARCO – who primes it, aims –</p>
<p><strong>noyle</strong>: Captain Marco, would you please shoot Private
Baker so we can move on?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Aaaahhhhhhh –!</p>
<p><strong>mirella/anderson</strong>: Aaaahhhhhh –!</p>
<p><strong>mirella</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yeah. Yes. Bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: We’ve arrived, Congressman.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>171 ext. p.s. 16 - westchester - day 171</strong>: Raymond
emerges to cameras and fanfare – it’s election day, and he’s going to
vote. Anderson and other agents clear a path up the steps into the
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL VOTING SITE. Reporters shout questions that Raymond
just answers with his professional smile.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. p.s. 16 - gymnasium - day 172</strong>: A temporary
polling place. Flags, tables, not too crowded. VOTERS stepping out of
the way. POLL VOLUNTEERS pressing in to shake hands and wish Raymond
Shaw good luck. And</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: on the edge. She badges Anderson, and talks
to him. He nods, moves over and talks quietly to Raymond as Raymond
signs his name in the voter registration log. Then lets Rosie guide him
to a booth on the end –</p>
<p><strong>173 int. voting booth - raymond 173</strong>: pulls the giant
lever, the curtains close, finds – A NOTE – folded, taped to the
machine. RAYMOND – opens it, reads it.</p>
<p><strong>voting booth - moments later</strong>: the curtain opens and
Raymond steps out, smiling again. Cameras flash, video crews wave boom
mikes, expecting a sound bite:</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I was on the fence when I walked in there …
but then I saw my name on the ballot and I knew what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>174 int. p.s. 16 - corridor 174</strong>: Raymond, Rosie and
his Secret Service detail – Rosie leads them to a doorway, holds it open
for Raymond, but puts her hand lightly on Anderson’s chest when he
starts to go in to sweep the room –</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: It’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>175 int. p.s. 16 - special ed. room - day 175</strong>:
Small, and private. Raymond turns on the light. Marco is in the corner,
waiting. His Noyle File in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: How’s your back?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’ve been having the dreams, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Good? They’re inside my head. They got
inside, the way you said they would –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: We’ll get ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: They’re all … twisted together – and I
dream things, terrible things, that can’t possibly have happened. I’m
gone, Ben – I’m losing it –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: No – you could have had me locked up – and
you didn’t. That’s a sign.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: That they don’t control everything. We can
fight it. I mean – I’m still out here because you decided I should be –
which means there’s a part they can’t get to, deep inside – the part
where the truth is, and they can’t touch us there. That’s what we need
to tap into, Raymond, that’s the part where, you and me, we’re gonna
take them out.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Jocie’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – and the Senator.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Did I do it?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I think so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I don’t remember. I don’t remember it.</p>
<p><strong>176 intercut - corridor - rosie and anderson 176</strong>:
down the hallway, standing sentinel. Anderson checks his watch, glances
uncomfortably back at the door – then at Rosie, who just stares him
down.</p>
<p><strong>177 resume - special ed. room - raymond 177</strong>: Tears
run down his face, but his voice is normal, he stays expressionless. He
rubs his eyes with the heel of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m all inside-out.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Mr. Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: All I’ve ever done is what I was supposed
to do. What I was told to do –</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Raymond – focus –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: – What others want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Did they tell you what they want you to do,
Ray? We gotta know what’s gonna happen, we gotta know when’s it gonna
happen – you can help me do this –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: You don’t think they saw this coming? You
don’t think they factored you in? I need to die, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What? No – no, man, they’ve got big plans for
you –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I’m the enemy, Major Marco, and the only
way to stop me is to kill me. I thought you were smarter than this.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: I can get the Feds, the police. Come on, Ray
– fight it –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Are we friends?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Raymond, you gotta work with me here –</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I want to believe we’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: Raymond, stay focused. The irrefutable fact
is that Jocie was a mistake, and we’re gonna make ’em pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: I dream you, Ben. You kill Private Baker.
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>marco</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes mother.</p>
<p><strong>178 intercut - corridor - day 178</strong>: Students flood

<p><strong>raymond</strong>: She wants you.</p>

immediately by Anderson and his secret service detail, and escorted out
of the building.</p>

to the WINDOW of a suite high above the street, where sunlight still
lingers on the glass, shimmering gold, and</p>
<p><strong>188 int. plaza hotel suite - late afternoon 188</strong>:
TV188 A beautiful suit laid out on the king-size bed … shoes TV188</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The bullet will pass over your shoulder, just
missing your head on the way to its target …</p>
<p><strong>189 int. bedroom - late afternoon 189</strong>: where Raymond
sits, stripped to the waist, watching the mirror as his mother looms
over him, in a beautiful Chinese silk dress, combing his damp hair.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … because, of course, the assassin – the
deranged, obsessed, tragically</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: paranoid, lone gunman – is trying to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: The Major is an excellent marksman.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: But what will happen to him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The assassin always dies, baby. It’s
necessary for the national healing.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sure you will never entirely comprehend
this, darling, and I know, the way you are right now, this is like
trying to have a whimpered conversation with someone on a distant star …
but it must be said, Raymond – I did this for you – so that you could
have what I could not, what your father didn’t want – what your
grandfather dared to dream possible –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: – when you ran away to join the Army, after
that girl, after Jocie – when you swore you’d never speak to me again, I
felt your father’s shadow pass across us, and I couldn’t let him run you
the way he ruined himself. That’s when Mark Whiting came to me with talk
of extraordinary scientific breakthroughs … Attitude adjustment …
Reconciliation … Greatness. So I let them take you, and change you. Not
too much. Not so much that you’d notice. Just enough to bring you back
to me.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes, mother.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: And look what you have, now! Look how far
we’ve come! It’s working, darling – they think they own you, but they
are very, very wrong. You’re not something they can buy and sell,
Raymond, not for</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: any price – we’re one, and there’ll be no
stopping us now, will there? We’re going to save this country in the
hour of its greatest need.</p>
<p><strong>raymond</strong>: Yes, mother.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: How much you look like my father, now – you
have his hands, and you hold your head in the same proud way. And when
you smile it’s like I’m a little girl again, and – When you smile – when
you smile –</p>

the room festooned with “SECURE TOMORROW” banners, and –</p>
<p><strong>two vast floor-to-ceiling, virtual wall-to-wall

of monitors, control panels and mixing boards. ON ALL THE SCREENS:
different views of the empty stage, from various cameras.</p>
<p><strong>196 another all-access security badge 196</strong>: just like
Anderson’s. PAN UP: MARCO – resplendent in dress uniform, hair trimmed,

cables and power lines, follows their drunken path to the end of a
narrow corridor –</p>

in the air vent … … he opens it, revealing a disassembled SNIPER RIFLE,
stereo RANGEFINDER EYEPIECE, live rounds, sandbag, tripod and a SIDEARM
… … he turns toward the back of a MASSIVE WALL-GRID of LIGHT FIXTURES

DOZEN MONITORS show different angles of the entrance, corridors,

sailor, a fireman, a marine, a policeman, a fighter pilot, everybody
waving, smiling. THE CROWD – ecstatic.</p>

close-up of Arthur –</p>

shake on-stage supports’ hands –</p>
<p><strong>213 ballroom floor - rosie 213</strong>: staring up at the
left-side lighting grid … where she thinks she saw movement. As it
blinks OFF, and then ON again in a different pattern, there’s the
SILHOUETTE of something. A figure behind the grid. Marco? She’s sure of
it – – and she’s moving, pushing her way toward an exit, pulling a tiny
walkie-talkie from her pocket and yelling into it –</p>
<p><strong>214 through marco’s scope: 214</strong>: Rock-steady on
Arthur and his hundred-watt smile, as he now separates from the

centered in Marco’s sights, but then – – Raymond and Ellie glide in
front of Marco’s target – lingering in Marco’s eyeline, Raymond stares
up into the scope – eyes trusting, urging, as if he’s saying: now – –
then ARTHUR IS ALONE AGAIN, in the center of the crosshairs, waving and
grinning at the ROARING CROWD like a man who’s just been elected
President, but – – MARCO’s crosshairs SWING OVER, finding RAYMOND AND
ELLIE again –</p>

cascade down on a nearly black-and-white tableau of pandemonium and
chaos, against the soaring wall-to-wall images of America’s greatness
displayed on the IMAX screens. Screaming and shouting. President-elect
Arthur vanishing in a phalanx of Secret Service. VIDEO CREWS pressing in
on the stage, morbidly curious … … and a strange clearing around the
bodies of Raymond and Eleanor Shaw, crumpled and bloody … … still locked
in their embrace.</p>

on. The SECURITY FOOTAGE of Marco entering the Regent Wall Street hotel.
His face turned away.</p>
<p><strong>another frame</strong>: Marco turning toward us. His FACE
becoming artificially highlighted, digitized – MORPHED. ZOOM IN as his
features BEGIN TO CHANGE. Non-descript. New features emerging.
Caucasian. Not Marco. CLICKING of a keyboard, and – ROSIE’S REFLECTION –
becomes visible across the screen of THE VIDEO MONITOR on which the
security footage flickers. We are:</p>
<p><strong>249 int. video cgi booth 249</strong>: Where an ENGINEER
works keyboard and mouse, digitally altering the footage of Marco is
Rosie watches, intently, from just behind him. Further back in the same
room … another senior FEDERAL AGENT, Special Agent VOLK, from Marco’s
interrogation … and Colonel Garret leans against the far wall, arms
folded, expressionless.</p>
<p><strong>media icon</strong>: … the FBI today released security
footage of the assassin of Raymond and Eleanor Prentiss Shaw entering
the hotel two hours before the fatal shooting …</p>
<p><strong>250 network newscast 250</strong>: The footage we’ve just
seen playing behind:</p>
<p><strong>tv250 media icon tv250</strong>: … Authorities say that they
have no further information about the identity of the gunman, except
that he was a white male, perhaps 30 years of age, and not a member of
the armed forces. The tragic deaths of the incumbent vice president and
his Senator mother mark the end of a family dynasty that has dominated
American politics for more than fifty years. The mother and the son,
polar opposites on myriad issues, nevertheless managed to promise a “one
plus one equals ten” kind of equation to many Americans; the hopeful,
heady notion that these two somehow comprised a united vision of
stunning, almost revolutionary breadth and depth … a combined potential
far greater than its parts …</p>
<p><strong>media icon</strong>: … President-elect Arthur has vowed to
bring to justice whatever nation – or nations – are responsible. Still
reeling from the recent tragic loss of Senator Thomas Jordan, Congress
has already announced a fresh investigation into Jordan’s death, in an

<p><strong>251 ext. ocean - day 251</strong>: WE ARE JETTING LOW and
impossibly fast across whitecapped azure water, toward crumbled ruins of
a long-abandoned village on an empty beach – we remember it vividly from
Marco’s memory – arriving to slowly SPIN and hover over the remnants of
an ancient caravansary:</p>

sun- bleached tile work we remember from Noyle’s lab.</p>

waste it on two guys.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: We know that.</p>
