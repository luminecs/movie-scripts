<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA
VIRIDANS. Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green with
black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider. As we follow it
down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR appears from the bottom of
frame. Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
suspended. Something’s not right. It waves a leg tentatively through the
air…</p>
<p><strong>darren’s voice</strong>: Come on… Just a little lower… WIDEN
TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on the lid of the
closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over his head, is DARREN SHAN.
Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent. The spider just
hangs there.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Come on… I’ll take good care of you. All the
bugs you can eat.</p>
<p><strong>middle school boys room</strong>: The door bangs open and
STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren, Steve’s not so well-liked. In fact,
he can be trouble. Maybe that’s why they’re friends.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Darren! No answer. Steve walks along the
stall, scoots low so he can see any feet in front of the bowls.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Did you fall in? Darren!</p>
<p><strong>darren’s voice</strong>: Shhh… Steve looks to the last stall,
sees the jar being held up. INTERCUT from in and outside of the
stall.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re gonna scare him away.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Man, we’re getting killed out there. It’s
three to nothing. Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a
little.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Your problem, Steve, not mine… Steve gets a
waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing his forefinger over the
spigot, he turns the faucet. WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve
directs into and then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up
its thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling. The stall door opens.
Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve who flashes a wicked grin…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: GOAL! Three to one! The other team regroups,
starts back upfield with the ball. Darren steals it. A few strides and
WHUMP! Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just over
the backpedaling goalie’s head, bounces into the goal.</p>
<p>****: Three to two! Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away.
It veers off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What does that prove? Huh? The goalie
blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous about Steve. He likes
to fight. Darren gets between them.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Go get the ball. It’s 3 to 2. Lunch’s almost
over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s why he kicked it. To kill time. Well,
I still got time to kick your face.</p>
<p>****: Forget it. The ball. Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie
gulps in relief.</p>
<p><strong>goalie</strong>: Thanks, Darren. He’s crazy. Darren watches
after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.</p>
<p><strong>the street</strong>: Steve tracks down the ball which has
rolled into the street. From seemingly out of nowhere… A gleaming black
1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking at the asphalt as it rolls.
The windows blacked out. It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The
ball BURSTS.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You idiot! The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles
ominously. Suddenly Steve doesn’t seem so tough. He looks nervously back
to Darren. But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off. A
sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The wind sends it
sailing. It drifts down, until… Steve notices, snatches it out of the
air. Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear down the
street. Creepy…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Look at this. The paper is a FLYER. A
startling, violent layout. Beneath a snarling WOLF’S HEAD: CIROUE DU
FREAK - Human oddities and other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion
Theater. $20 - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: .Human oddities and other living
curiosities…</p>
<p>****: Other. Does that mean not human?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: A freak show. Ever been to one?</p>
<p>****: Just this school. Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire
tracks on the back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now…</p>
<p><strong>a boa occidentalis</strong>: Probing the confines of its
glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR by any other name. It’s a prison within
a prison because we’re inside…</p>
<p><strong>the school science lab - day</strong>: The teacher, MR.
DALTON, moves ponderously around the room. His voice like a
metronome.</p>
<p><strong>mr. dalton</strong>: As you can see reptiles and amphibians
are not one in the same. As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS
OF STUDENTS, their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS… DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at
a Komodo Dragon. After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen
views. He’s done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen or so
entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show. Under 1920’s there’s an
older, much more ‘Victorian’ pamphlet for the Cirque du Freak. A more
ornate version of the same Wolf Head. The same notice from the
proprietor. Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Must be a different one. Steve scrolls down
through pictures:</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I gotta show you something…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vampires. I’ve been studying them. Vampires?
Darren looks at him a beat.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Right. You’re failing half your classes at
school, but you’re studying vampires.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: They been around 1000’s of years. Two tribes.
They even fight wars.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What? When?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay, sometimes, when humans fight? They
fight at the same time. And no one knows it. Like at the Battle of
Stalingrad they fought at the same time the Russians and Germans were
fighting. Darren just looks at him, wonders if he’s serious.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Some people know about it. There have even
been books written. He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his
bag.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That’s your proof? It smells. Steve’s really
trying to convince him now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s everywhere if you look. On the internet,
in blogs, newspapers, weird places. But you can find it. The room starts
to tighten a notch around them.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I chatted online with one of them.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Serious. We become aware of…</p>
<p><strong>a sinister pov</strong>: Someone watching Darren and Steve
through the half open doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from
behind.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What was his name? Mr. Dracula? Mad now,
Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th Century painting.
He slaps down the science lab internet print-out of Larten Crepsley.
It’s the same guy! Maybe…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Here he is in 1923. And here 1855. Huh? Maybe
he’ll be there tonight. Would that make you believe? As Darren looks
them over, the POV looms up behind them. Suddenly Darren spins… And
ROARS at what’s behind them: his sister Annie. She SCREAMS in response.
Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Saw your shadow on the floor. Gotta try
harder, knucklehead. Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his
backpack.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m gonna get a soda.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Get me one, too. Steve gets up, stomps out
of the room.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I know you want to fight global warming,
Darren, but that’s not the way to do it. Steve leans back to show his
face.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry, Mrs. Shan.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Oh hi, Steve. I thought you were, Darren.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I wish I was.</p>
<p>****: You guys got everything in here.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Help yourself. She sets her PURSE down on the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: She’s okay… She’s been working a lot lately.
A little frown of concern crosses Darren’s mom. Something about Steve…
His mom… He brings out a bottle of soda.</p>
<p>****: Glasses are up there.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I know. Darren’s mom exits as Steve pulls
down two glasses, starts to pour soda. As he waits for the foam to
settle, he sees… The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn’t
take him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse. A quick
rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20’s. He peels off three bills, shoves
them in his pocket. BLLEEEP! A cell phone starts going off in the purse.
Fumbling, frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse – Darren’s Mom is
back in. She’s hurrying to get to her celiphone, so…</p>
<p>****: Hello? .it takes her a second to realize something’s up. Not
listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses and hurry
out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and guilt in the air. As she
looks over at her purse…</p>
<p><strong>darren’s room</strong>: Darren’s looking through Steve’s
vampire memorabilia. Steve reaches past, starts packing it up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I gotta go. See ya tonight.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Huh? Tonight where? He zips the bag, slings
it over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Cirque du Freak.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I got no money right now.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Don’t sweat it. I got money. Meet me ten to
Midnight. The Zeiterion Theater.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That place is supposed to be haunted. Steve
rolls his eyes, starts out…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What am I going to tell my parents?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Tell them you’re sleeping over. We can meet
early, walk over together.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I don’t know, man…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: D, it’s Cirque du Freak. You wanna hear about
it Monday? Or see it tonight? Steve lets his point sink in, then
goes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And that’s why we need a dog. She waits for
an answer. Mom and Dad exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We’ll have to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How do you guys decide who’s going to say no
when you look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Whoever’s eyes are the widest. And I didn’t say
no. Yet. As she tries to think through a new approach…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Mom? I’m gonna sleep over Steve’s tonight?
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What? Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Because I said so, Darren.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m fourteen. I shouldn’t even have to ask
stuff like this.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: The answer is no. And I’m not sure I want you
hanging around with Steve anymore.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’ve known him since I was five years
old!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: People change and I don’t like the way Steve’s
changing.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: But – That’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Stop arguing with her, Darren. Furious at his
treatment, Darren gets up, stomps out. As Annie wonders if she should
ask what’s up…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I came here after your house. There was a van
there, guy selling tickets. Rest is history. They cross toward the
ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted,
except for a few CANDLES burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind
moans.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You know why they closed it, right? Years
ago a kid fell out of the balcony and died. It’s haunted.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Get inside.</p>
<p><strong>a hallway</strong>: They move toward a light at the end.
Darren pauses at a darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to
Steve…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The balcony. Where he fell…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: May I help you? They wheel around, react to
the sight behind them. MR. TALL. Gaunt, but oozing an elegant
toughness.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: We’re here to see the show. He takes an
ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Ticket. Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall
pockets it, looks to Darren.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Do you have your ticket? Darren. Darren
starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his name. Mr. Tall
reaches, takes it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: This way. We’re about to begin. Mr. Tall
turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:</p>
<p>****: He knew my name.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Maybe he heard me say it.</p>
<p><strong>around corner</strong>: When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone.
Vanished. Ahead, a threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other
side. The boys exchange a last look, then push through into…</p>
<p><strong>the zeiterion theater</strong>: Mouldings removed, cherubs
gouged from the walls of a once proud theater. Rows of seats are missing
as well. Those that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special. No sign of
Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of the aisle. The only kids
here. Somewhere off stage a TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light
goes out. Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second stage light
goes out. And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats, the
theater has gone black. A final flourish from the trumpets and all is
silent. Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it was
empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center. There’s the
scraping of chain. A low guttural sound. A white spot shines down,
leaves the front half of the cage in light, the back half in shadow. A
FIGURE moves in there.. The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when
there’s a ROAR! Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front
of the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body covered in
thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the bars. Its half-canine
teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain hangs attached to an iron collar
around its neck. Half the audience believe it’s real. The other half are
amazed at how real this ‘performer’ seems. As they buzz, Mr. Tall steps
out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to the
Cirque du Freak. We are an ancient circus. We have toured for five
hundred years…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: .Bringing the remarkable and grotesque to
generations. Our freaks are not people in masks. They are not harmless
misfits. What you see tonight is real. Each performer unique. None
harmless. To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who’s non- reaction
shows he knows exactly where he’s standing. A ripple goes through the
crowd as they become aware of TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for
the Moulin Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats. Even the
Wolfman takes notice.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Beauty and the beast. Truska approaches
the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper body swaying. The Wolfman
lulls to a trance. Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue
robes, step out and start to push the cage off stage. Truska steps
toward the audience, moving in the same languorous rhythm. And then: she
begins to grow a BEARD. Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from
her chin. Some in the audience recoil. Darren and Steve trade grins.
This is great. Then… From either wing of the stage come twin
contortionists: SIVE &amp; SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs
pulled back with their ankles cinched behind there necks. As Truska
exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like Hindu wrestlers they take
turns, climbing up and down each other, look like one person with two
fronts. They twist like pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend
to be stuck. As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds. After a
moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The light leaves the
contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.</p>
<p><strong>rhamus</strong>: My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And I do have
two. He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in the
front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus stops short,
LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He’s practically doubled-over,
resting his hands on his haunches. More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a
CART covered with food and lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS
BOTTLE of soda. Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews
it and swallows. Soon he’s eating food almost as fast as he can grab it.
Disgusting, but great fun at the same time. Next, he holds up a couple
of nuts and bolts. Then swallows them whole. He swings his belly around.
You can hear the sound of metal shifting inside. The crowd recoils as he
starts to regurgitate, spitting out BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a
JACKKNIFE. They clatter on stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between
his teeth. He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
mouth, up from his belly. One foot…two…six feet in all. With a shrug he
starts off stage, dragging it behind him. Darren &amp; Steve break into
applause. So does the audience. As Rhamus’ chain slides out of sight, a
SNAKE slides in. An enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It
slithers out to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises itself
several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly transfixed by the
light. But in reality… The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving
down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged with green.
This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists over backwards to set his
feet down on the stage. Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly
spins out of. The audience GASPS… Wearing only shorts, Evra’s body
SPARKLES. He’s covered in gold, blue and green scales! He moves a
vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the snake which raises
itself higher still. He slowly slides forward till he and the boa are
nearly eye-to-eye. Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the
nose.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He’s as old as us.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In
response, the snake begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a
barber shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back to
look him in the eye. And then… Evra bends at the knees, lays down and
starts to roll. Like he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears
stage left. More applause from the audience. Then the stage goes dark
except for a small focused spot at the center. Everyone waits, but
nothing happens until… Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant
there’s nothing under the spot and the next instant there is –</p>
<p><strong>larten crepsley!</strong>: Motionless, looking past the
crowd. The only difference from his pictures is he’s a bit older and a
SCAR runs down his left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that
side.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; steve</strong>: Recognize him. Can’t believe
their eyes. Steve pulls the print-out from his pocket, compares.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s him…</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble
nervously. And just as suddenly he’s back! On the edge of the stage, lit
by the footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: It’s not true. That all tarantulas are
poisonous. Though some can kill a man. With one bite. Crepsley whisks
off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA the size of a large man’s
hand. So big you can make out individual eyes. As deadly looking as it
is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Reacts. A spider!</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Crepsley makes the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that she never
learns yours. Two of the blue-robed ‘little people’ lead a GOAT onto the
stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley starts over.
The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it. Mr. Crepsley flicks open the
cage door with his finger. The spider sets its front legs on the bars,
pulls itself through. A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey. Several audience
members CRY OUT that this should stop. Crepsley looks out with
mock-theatrical surprise.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No…? Shall it be life? Chuckling to
himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They release the goat which
bee-lines its way off the stage. Crepsley faces the audience.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I wonder if you would be as shocked to see
the same fate for me? Madam Octa moves – climbing the outside of the
cage – taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
starting up Crepsley’s arm. He stands dead still.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; steve</strong>: Have a million questions, but
right now the performance has their full edge-of-their-seat
attention.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley’s left
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Though we have been together such a long
time, she is no pet. I think she would quite enjoy killing me. Crepsley
calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN WHISTLE. Madam Octa
has reaches his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: For her bite there is no cure. Madam Octa
bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence about to be directed
at her master. Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and
starts to play, as simple as it is evocative. Madam Octa hesitates.
Then, she moves around his throat, starts to climb his face using his
scar as her guide. She gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock
of hair. She sways; she’s dancing! Then she leaps, lands on the end of
the whistle. Crepsley keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops
down about 18 inches off the end. She starts to swing. Crepsley takes
the whistle from his mouth and twirls it around. Octa does a few 360s
and the thread breaks. She sails up high over Crepsley’s head. He cranes
back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She lands flat on his
face. The whistle is in his hand. Crepsley looks out at the audience.
Looking out between her hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage is plunged
into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM. A horrible, horrible sound. The
audience wait, but nothing happens. Some of them rise from their seats,
peer into the gloom. It’s too dark. The sound of something being
DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps
out.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That is
the end of our show.</p>
<p><strong>audience man</strong>: But… What happened to him?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Don’t you know? What happens to us all,
can happen to any of us. That said, there’s a crack of thunder and an
explosion seemingly at Mr. Tall’s feet. He’s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Let’s get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: No, you go. I’m staying. Steve starts down
toward the stage. Darren follows.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Wait. What’re you doing? Steve reaches the
stage, looks around. The audience is mostly exited; no one from the
Cirque is in sight. As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his
shoulder. Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is my destiny. Don’t ruin it. Steve
looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands in surrender. Steve
eases off, but he’s still intense.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That car today. It was a sign. Sending me
here. I was told there’d be a sign. Too friggin’ weird.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Told by who? The guy in the chat room? The
internet guy?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ll tell you later. If I can. Steve
scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back. Darren stands,
whispers into the dark.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve… Decision time. Darren climbs up,
starts after his friend.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve…? No answer. Darren decides, starts
down steep, rickety steps.</p>
<p><strong>steve - understage storage area</strong>: He moves past a
dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he heads further into the
dark.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Turning a corner, is startled by what turns
out to be a costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it. The dust is
tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a corner. Steve steps
over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs up the wall, disappears into a
hole punched in the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through
the gloom to his left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He
sees…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He’s opened the door to the fridge. The
little bulb inside pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his
face! The bars of her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he
crouches behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar
that looks to be filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around
inside.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley’s voice</strong>: Are you looking for me? Steve
whirls – drops the bottle – SMASH! Standing behind him - dead still -
CREPSLEY.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Rooted to the spot. Watching…</p>
<p><strong>steve &amp; crepsley</strong>: Crespley sniffs the air - the
spilled blood to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I – I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Tell me, boy. Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’re a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Too broad a definition. Do you introduce
yourself as a human? Who I am is Larten Crepsley.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Moving slightly to get a clearer view.</p>
<p><strong>steve &amp; crepsley</strong>: Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS,
REAPPEARS much closer. Steve jumps, twists around. Unnerved.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Who sent you and what do they want?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nothing. No one. Crepsley takes a moment to
decide if he believes him.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Then what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I want to join you.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Join me? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I want you to make me a vampire. Not what
Crepsley expected. Steve stands there trying to look resolved. Crepsley
is surprised, intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Is it because you want to live forever?
Because we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t care about living forever. But you do
seem to live a long time.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: A long time alone. Do you want to live
alone?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I already do.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Are you an orphan?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: My father’s gone; my mother doesn’t care
about me.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Nor mine. You’re friendless also?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I have a friend, but he doesn’t understand.
He’s got too much to know what it’s like to be alone. As Darren reacts
to this…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: When you’re alone you feel weak. Useless. But
I know there must be something strong about it, too. I want to feel the
power of being alone. I want to be a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The power of being alone will never be
greater than the weakness of it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t care. Crepsley’s actually impressed,
but after a moment he waves a dismissive hand.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: It makes no matter. We do not blood
children. I’m sorry. Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open
the 2- inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Do you intend to use that on me? And we
feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own palm. He holds it
up, moist and red in Crepsley’s face.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Do it. Make me a vampire.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Do not tempt me.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Can’t believe what he’s watching. He sees
Crepsley suddenly get ‘scent’ of something. Something to do with Steve’s
blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve’s wrist, dabs a
finger into his palm and then tastes it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground
and immediately begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You have bad blood.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I can taste the menace in your blood. You
can never be a vampire. You’re evil. Steve scrambles to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: That’s a lie. You take that back! Crepsley
draws himself full, his voice deadly.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Go home. Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands
there blinking.</p>
<p><strong>go!</strong>: Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a
moment, we can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley,
seemingly ill, holds his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he
steps over and kicks the fridge door closed. And in the blink of an eye,
he’s gone. Disappeared. Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops.
Looks back. That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa’s cage
and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh. You want that? Darren picks up the worm,
lowers it between the bars. A beat and then Madam Octa snatches it away
from him. Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: See? I’m your friend… You’re so beautiful I
stopped thinking. The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage,
continues.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Get inside. From his angle, Darren’s Dad can’t
see the cage in his son’s hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of
part of the trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A freak show? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It was down at the old Zeiterion Theater.
Look, dad, I’m sorry. It’s just, I couldn’t resist. I –</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You told me the other day you were broke. You
were looking for a job to do around the house this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Yeah? So?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Where’d you get money for the show?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve had money. Darren’s Dad’s suspicion is
confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Steve… We weren’t going to tell you, but we
think Steve stole money from your Mom’s purse yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Mom’s pretty sure about it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Man, what is this? You don’t want me hanging
around with him. Now you say you think he stole money? Do you know for
sure?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve’s had some bad times lately. I’m
trying to be a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Being a good friend and sneaking out are two
different things.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I have to sneak out! You treat me like a
kid! A moment as Darren’s raised voice rings out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Then act like an adult if that’s how you want
to be treated. This world is crossed by fences – Darren interrupts. He’s
heard it a million times.</p>
<p><strong>darken</strong>: I know, I know. And you gotta decide which
side you stand on. And you can’t sit on it either. His Dad doesn’t enjoy
hearing his words thrown back at him. He starts for the door, looks back
before exiting.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: A freak show. What do they do, put people in
cages for everyone to laugh at?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It wasn’t like that. A beat. Darren’s Dad
goes, closing the door. Darren sighs. He goes to the window, pulls up
the cage. He scans a look outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is
clear.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Is he in a lot of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Nothing a few years in prison won’t take care
of.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t see what the big deal is…</p>
<p>****: Did you talk to Steve’s mom yet?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Get this. She said she couldn’t comment because
she didn’t make it home last night herself.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Where was she?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Go tell Darren it’s breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>madam octa - video view</strong>: Seen through the bars of
her cage. FREEZE FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s room</strong>: Darren’s just snapped her photo with
his DIGITAL CAMERA. As the door bursts open and Annie enters… Darren
scrambles to block the cage from view.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Annie, you gotta learn to knock.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mom said to come eat. What’s that? As Annie
tries to look, Darren stays in front of her.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Out. Annie sighs, heads out. Darren puts the
cage in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Mom, this is the best omelette I ever had.
His Dad can’t help but smile. Good move. Mom is pleased, but knows she’s
being manipulated. As Annie stifles a laugh, Darren shoots her a look. A
KNOCK at the kitchen door. Annie gets up, opens the door to reveal:
Steve. From his angle he can only sees Annie.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, midget, where’s the idiot? Annie motions
Steve in. He stops short when he see everyone else. He recovers, does
his best Eddie Haskell…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hi, Mr. Shan, Mrs. Shan. It’s nice to see ya.
As Steve gets several less than welcoming looks…</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What was that? Everyone acting like they
don’t know me. Did I walk in on something? Darren closes the door. Gets
to the point.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What happened last night?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Nothing. I hung out in the theater for
awhile, but no one was around. The lie hangs in the air a moment.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry about the way I acted. I’m sorry I
pushed you.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Don’t worry. There’s, you know, no bad blood
or anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I said don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You said bad blood. I never heard you say
something like that before.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What are you, the word police? Steve gives
him a look. A weird tension in the air. Darren glances at the bandage on
Steve’s palm, changes the topic.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Wanna see that new game I got?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sure… Darren steps over, starts his computer
up. While waiting, Steve sees the digital camera on the dresser, picks
it up.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I gotta get one of these. Steve switches it
on. Something occurs to Darren too late…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Let me see that – On the screen: the PHOTO
OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around to keep the camera out of Darren’s
reach.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s Madam Octa.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I took it at the show.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Liar. Look at the background. This got taken
right on your desk. Darren’s caught. As they just stare at each
other.</p>
<p><strong>madam octa</strong>: In her cage, on the desk. Darren and
Steve looking her over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: They were loading a van outside. I, I just
took her.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Just like that… You stole from a vampire you
know?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Just because he had a coffin doesn’t mean
he’s really a… Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the
coffin.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You were there, weren’t you?</p>
<p>****: You heard what he said to me? That I was evil?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I didn’t believe it. Steve studies Darren,
hopes that’s true.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I heard what you said to him, too. That you
wanted to be a vampire. Steve doesn’t want to talk about it. He looks at
Madam Octa.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: How do you think he made her do what he
wanted? Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I wish I knew how to play it.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think that was just for show. I think he
used something else. Some kind of mind control.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You mean telepathy?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I bet anyone with a brain could do it. Which
leaves you out. Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm.
The tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice</strong>: Can I come in? Darren goes to the
door. Opens it a few inches.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I swear to God, Annie…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What? I knocked. As they talk, Steve opens
the cage door. Madam Octa sets her arms on the edge, pulls herself
out.</p>
<p><strong>leaps –</strong>: Lands on Steve’s shoulder. Her fangs, wet
with poison, glint just before she sinks them into Steve’s throat. She
BITES!</p>
<p>****: Don’t move. Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which
leans in the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it. Madam
Octa drops down onto the window sill – WHAM! Wood cracks as Darren
brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too quick. She disappears,
leaping out the open window! Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to
Steve, turns him over. Steve’s skin is already a deathly pale.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve… Annie reaches out, takes Steve’s
hand.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Darren, he’s freezing.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Get dad. Go.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What kind of spider was it?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I think some kind of a tarantula.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It got away. Darren’s Dad holds up the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: We have a picture of it. The doctor takes it as
a NURSE meets the gurney.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor Lund. And we
need to download a photo to poison control. This is as far as Darren
goes. Steve is wheeled in, surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in.
All we can see of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out. PUSH IN ON
DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that his world has only just
started to crash down around him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lund - hospital corridor</strong>: Tough, no nonsense.
Marching along, carrying a print-out, coming to a stop where Darren sits
on a plastic chair. He sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of
Madam Octa.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lund</strong>: How did you make this and why would you
make this? Darren’s Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. lund</strong>: Poison control couldn’t ID it. In fact,
the department of Entomology at Harvard couldn’t find it in their data
base. So either it’s a new species or it’s a fake photo.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: If my son said he took that photo, then that’s
the truth. Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: What have you done to him?! STEVE’S
MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled, cheap looking, she
hasn’t quite started her hangover yet. She lunges past Darren’s dad,
grabs Darren by the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>steve’s mom</strong>: Did you hurt Stevie?! Did you?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. lund</strong>: Your friend’s going to die unless we find
out what’s in him. On Darren. He looks down to where light spills out
from Steve’s room. His friend is going to die in there.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>zeiterion stage</strong>: Where he stops short, sees in the
center of the stage – Crepsley’s COFFIN. A beat and Darren steps up. He
grips the lid, starts sliding it back. He looks inside to see –</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What have you come for this time? Darren
pulls out a CRUCIFIX, holds it in Crepsley’s face. The vampire takes it,
looks it over. It has no effect.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Crosses don’t hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Why should they?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Because… you’re evil.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Am I? Are vampire bats evil when they
drink the blood of cows?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That’s different. Bats are animals.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: So am I. So are you. Our appetites don’t
make us evil. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Your spider bit my friend Steve. Crepsley
shrugs, tosses Darren back his crucifix.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes, well, boys who play with things they
do not understand can hardly complain if –</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You have to help him!</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The antidote to her poison is rare.
Expensive. Why should someone as evil as I am waste it on Steve?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’ll pay you back. If it takes 50 years.
Whatever it costs.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Money doesn’t interest me.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: There’s something you want. That’s why
you’re here waiting for me. Right? Crepsley’s surprised and pleased by
Darren’s intuitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The night Steve came below to speak to me,
you were there. Did you hear what we talked about?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He wanted to… become like you.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You don’t just ‘become’ a vampire. The
change is too extreme. And if the shock didn’t kill you, your
inexperience would. So you become one in stages. A half-vampire at
first. With greater strength than a human, but still able to go out in
sunlight. You learn from a full vampire. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I think so…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: But your friend has bad blood. He’s no
good. There’s no telling what he’ll become as he matures.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I don’t believe that someone can have bad
blood.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: And yesterday you didn’t believe in
vampires. Regardless, I’ve left the Cirque. Left my protection. I need
someone to protect me while I sleep. I need an apprentice.</p>
<p>****: Me? Crepsley nods.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re crazy. There’s no way.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Then your friend will die. The words hang
in the air. Crepsley smiles.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You hardly have a choice. It’s your
destiny.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Destiny? That doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Try this then. You’re reckless enough to
steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. That’s enough for
me.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Not for me.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes, well, destiny can’t be explained. It
must be lived. Now, you’re wasting my time.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: There’s gotta be another way.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: There isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Please… He’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: And he slips away while we argue. Life or
death? Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’d never be able to trust me. If I got a
chance for payback I’d take it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes or no? Thoughts rush, then stop.
Darren finally just nods. Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are
not especially long, but they look thick and sharp. Crepsley takes
Darren’s hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws blood. He dabs off a drop,
smells it, then tastes it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You have good blood. Crepsley lifts his
own left hand. He presses the nails of his right into the fleshy tips of
his left hand fingers. Then he uses the left nails to mark the right
fingers in the same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Lift your hands. Darren does as he’s told.
Crepsley digs all ten nails into all ten of Darren’s fingertips. Darren
jerks back in pain.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Get used to pain. More lies ahead. He
motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread. Crepsley
presses his fingertips to Darren’s. Blood brothers. As their eyes lock,
Darren frowns at an alien sensation.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The blood flows into your left arm and out
of your right. Do you feel it? Getting near your heart? Darren nods,
shivers.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Almost there. A force arcs through
Darren’s body. He screams, falls down.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The world will start to slow down. You’ll
become a witness of time. Your friend’s time is running out. He pulls
Darren to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Take my arm. Don’t let go. Darren takes
hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems more like he’s still and
the ground is moving under his feet. Darren looks about as the building
begin to streak past, the road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird
chromatic look. The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping
past. A moment later and they’re in the…</p>
<p><strong>hospital parking lot</strong>: Crepsley pulls loose Darren’s
hand. They’re still bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Lick your fingers. Vampire spit will stop
wounds from bleeding. Darren looks at his fingers, then around the
lot.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How’d we get here?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: It’s called flitting. Which room is your
friend in?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: We’re in time. He still has a few minutes
left. Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks a wax
seal then pinches out a small blackened cork. He pulls the drip line out
of the IV CATHETER and empties a drop of the vial’s dark, viscous
contents inside. It swirls murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into
Steve’s arm. A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
twitching. Is he dying?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: He was near death. The journey back is not
pleasant. What do you know about him, this boy with bad blood?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Hmm… Who’s his father?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Never met him. I don’t think Steve ever did
either. Why do you want to know? And then Steve comes around. He opens
his eyes, focuses on Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Darren? And then he drifts off, asleep. His
breathing growing deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he’s going to be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Will you come with me now or do you have
things to set in order first? That’s when it really hits home. He’s
agreed to leave every- thing and go off with a vampire. Without really
thinking, Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on
Crepsley.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I see… Darren’s almost to the door.
Crepsley stays where he is.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Run if you want. It won’t help. You’re a
creature of the night now, Darren Shan. Darren turns and bolts leaving
Crepsley alone. Chuckling, the vampire tucks Steve’s covers up under his
chin.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Darren… Wake up, honey. Darren wakes with a
start as she gives him a little shake. As he looks about, wonders what
reality he’s in.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I just got off the phone. Great news. Steve’s
going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: The hospital says it’s a miracle. Was it a
dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip of each finger and two
thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS. Darren instinctively hugs his mom.
She thinks he’s overjoyed, can’t see his look of terror. She hugs him
back.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Yeah, it’s great news. I know how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Boo! Darren nearly jumps out of his skin.
Annie laughs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Got you! I finally got you! - Darren turns on
her, looks like he could kill her.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Don’t ever do that again. Annie’s smile
drops away. As Darren continues on…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey, Shan, you gotta see this. They duck into
the classroom. Darren follows.</p>
<p><strong>science lab</strong>: TWENTY or so KIDS all pressed around
the Boa Constrictor tank. Steve holds court.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: .Doctor said it was a miracle. They say I’m
unique – Steve spots Darren as he steps up in the back.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hey, Darren. I’ve been looking for you. We
got a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But first… Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE
pokes its head out through an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch.
As Darren looks from the mouse to the snake… Steve addresses the kids
does his best ‘Mr. Tall’. He tries to be entertaining, but he comes off
creepy.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Welcome to Cirque du Steve. What happens to
us all can happen to any of us. If you watch, it’s by your own free
will. Say farewell…</p>
<p><strong>hefts mouse</strong>: .to Crepsley the mouse. Darren reacts
to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the terrarium. Some kids already
look away, others are intent.</p>
<p><strong>stop –</strong>: Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the
front.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s cruel.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: It’s nature. Anyhow don’t watch.</p>
<p>****: And don’t blink; you might miss it. Steve sets the mouse in the
terrarium. The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
away from the… SNAKE who’s suddenly alert. It raises its head, flicks
its tongue. Coils back on itself. ZAP! The snake STRIKES… And Darren
darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below its head, out of
mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible! The snake twists in Darren’s
hand. The students are blown away. Steve’s eyes narrow, his wheels are
turning. The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What happened to the spider?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I killed it. Steve hesitates, processes,
looks Darren over.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I had a dream. You and Crepsley were in my
hospital room…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Tell me about it later. Darren starts away.
Steve grabs him hard, spins him around.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’ll tell you now. Darren reacts
instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand and SLAMS him against the
wall. Steve’s nearly off the ground, only his left toe touching.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I said later. Darren lets go, heads off.
Steve watches, wonders.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Darren! Wait up! He looks over his shoulder,
keep going.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Can I walk home with you? He softens, slows
down. After a few silent steps.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Got you something. Darren pulls the MOUSE
from his pocket. Annie loves it, cups it in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He’s adorable.</p>
<p><strong>annie &amp; darren - a creature’s pov</strong>: Coming in low
and fast.</p>
<p><strong>street</strong>: Annie SCREAMS as a GERMAN SHEPHERD charges,
stops just short of them. GROWLING like it was rabid. Like it hates
Darren. Darren steps between it and Annie. Darren’s pupils dilate oddly;
he curls his lip to show his own teeth. The dog starts to back off..</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey. That’s King.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No it’s not. King’s my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s King, Darren. It is. Darren realizes
it is King. As Darren realizes something’s wrong with Darren.. Another
growl. From down the street. Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN
prowls through the intersection. The one seen at school. It slows,
windows blacked out. As it continues, disappears from view…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Come on. As Darren hurries Annie along down
the street…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: How was school today?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The usual. Sometimes it was boring,
sometimes really boring. Darren’s mom laughs. Then…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ouch! She drops the knife on the cutting board.
A thick drop of BLOOD runs down her finger. Darren flinches at the sight
and in that moment we PUNCH INTO his eyes. The PUPILS swirl red; the
IRISES flatten and narrow. A dark, ravenous look.</p>
<p><strong>mom - darren’s pov</strong>: Holding up her finger. Her skin
tone receding back into gray, the blood pulsing with red vibrancy.
Alive. A target.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Standing at the blood’s seeming siren call.
But as he suddenly moves forward, she turns away. Darren stops as she
wraps her finger in a paper towel. She looks back at him: misunderstands
his hunger for concern.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s okay, honey. I just need a band-aid.
Darren looks at his mom’s neck. His eyes zero in on a little blue VEIN
PULSING away. She leaves the room to get a band- aid. As Darren’s horror
sinks in…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re different…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Hello? Hey! Crepsley appears. Darren turns,
sees him. A beat. Crepsley raises his hands to the gloom around
them.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The darkness isn’t so scary anymore, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m starting to think it’s me that’s scary.
Crepsley waits to hear more.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s only gonna get worse, isn’t it? There’s
no way back, is there? No magic potion to make me human again? Crepsley
shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: We made a deal. I won’t run away again.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: It’s neither here nor there, but, I do
feel sorry for you. Darren waves it off, doesn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Are you ready then? The night is young. We
can make many miles.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I can’t just – My family, I can’t let them
think I just left them. Or that something happened to me. My mother
would… She couldn’t… As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look
sympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: There’s only one thing for it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: We’ll have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m going to bed. They say ‘good night’ to
him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his dad on the cheek, then does the same
to his mom.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I love you both. I don’t say it that much,
but I do. Darren’s Mom is caught off guard, but happy to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: We love you, too. Don’t we, Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Of course we do. Darren looks at them a beat,
then smiles, satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Good night. They watch him go, then exchange
looks.</p>
<p>****: Kids. Who knows how they think?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Goodbye, knucklehead. If I can ever help
you, I will.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Shut up. Off Crepsley’s reaction…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: This is my home and I’m never gonna see it
again, so don’t rush me. Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All
the same, he stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Hold onto this for me, okay? Crepsley takes
the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return. Darren sniffs, recoils at
the foul smell.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re sure it will work? Crepsley opens the
window.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Your heart will slow down so drastically
they won’t find a pulse. With the fall from the window, they’ll think
you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What if I break bones?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Even better. They’ll mend in a few days.
Vampires don’t stay broken for long and it takes a very long fall to
kill one.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: And the funeral home? Won’t they embalm me
or something?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Don’t worry. I have ways of making my
thoughts become the thoughts of others. They’ll leave you alone.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: My dad’s allergic to grass. It’s my job to
cut the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You have a new job now. Drink. Darren
steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: So this is destiny, huh? Tastes like crap.
Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Your breathing is slowing, your heart as
well. Do you feel it? Darren can’t answer. He blinks his eyes ‘yes’
instead.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You may be aware of what’s going on around
you. Remember, the grief that you hear will be a release for those who
express it. Darren’s eyes drift shut. Crepsley lets him go.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: No, no, come on – The Neighbor stops short
as he sees the body.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Hey – Hey, kid – He rolls Darren over,
realizes something is very wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Darren? Darren! A moment later his Mom…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Darren! Oh my God! We’re still on Darren’s
face, his eye open a slit.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: His parents hovering over him in
despair. The STARS TWINKLE. The neighbor leans in.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: Cause of death is trauma from the
impact of the fall. Poor kid.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Are we doing an autopsy?</p>
<p><strong>a new angle</strong>: Reveals Crepsley watching from around a
darkened corner.</p>
<p>****: Not on a child. Immediately…</p>
<p><strong>medical examiner</strong>: I’m not going to cut open a kid.
Not when I don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>girl one</strong>: He’s still cute.</p>
<p><strong>girl two</strong>: I always had a crush on him. The Goalie
from school soccer is next. He holds a little SOCCER BALL in his hand.
Tucks it into the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>goalie</strong>: For the next life, Shan. Top right corner
every time. Annie steps up, gently strokes her brother’s cheek. Then
suddenly overwhelmed, she buries her face in their Dad’s chest. He leans
in tenderly over his son. Choked up:</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I love you, Darren. You said it the other
night; I didn’t say it back.</p>
<p><strong>darren in his coffin</strong>: A hand reaches down, a thumb
opens his eyelid.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: Of the ceiling for a moment, then a
blinding light flashing back and forth. Then glimpses of Steve’s
face!</p>
<p><strong>visiting room</strong>: Steve holds Darren’s eye open, shines
a PENLIGHT into it. The pupil doesn’t dilate. Footsteps approach. Steve
switches it off, pockets it as the FUNERAL DIRECTOR enters.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m sorry. I know it’s difficult, but
visiting hours are over. Steve nods sadly, looks to Darren. He pats one
of Darren’s hands which are folded across his chest. In reality Steve
checks Darren’s fingertips. A WHITE SCAR at the end of each one. Steve’s
crazy idea may be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and
certain hope of the resurrection to come… Darren’s Dad tosses a handful
of earth down onto the coffin.</p>
<p><strong>darren inside the closed coffin</strong>: The lid an inch
from his face. His eyelid twitching as we hear shovelfuls of dirt hit
the lid. The sound growing duller at each turn. Then, as Darren’s eye
flickers open…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: On your feet.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: My legs are asleep.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Walk it off. I’ll fill this back in. Go.
Breathe some air. Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as
Darren ambles off. Not exactly the start of his best day.</p>
<p><strong>move with darren</strong>: Passing among the graves,
stretching his arms, twisting. Really beat up. He looks about, the names
and dates on the headstones popping into focus even from far away. Night
vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something: Steve. On the other side
of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Vampire hunting. Steve rushes the last step,
a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high over his head. He knocks Darren back on
the ground. Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake. Darren catches
hold of Steve’s wrist. Stops the point of the stake just over his heart.
Steve puts his weight into it. A desperate moment of struggle, but
Darren’s strength is resurgent. He throws Steve off. Steve rolls to his
feet, comes at him again. Darren catches his wrist with one hand, his
throat with the other. He slams him up against the mausoleum, holds him
there.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What do you have against vampires? You
wanted to become one yourself.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah, I wanted to, but you did. You stole my
dream. You stole my destiny.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Are you crazy? I did it to save your life.
That was the deal. Me for you.</p>
<p>****: Liar. You told him I was evil. You planned this all along. And
you’ll pay! You’ll pay – Darren jams the stake under Steve’s throat.
That stops him struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I want you to leave… Steve is just beginning
to realize how strong Darren is now.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I want you to leave and forget you ever saw
me. Understand? Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the
stake in two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I’m going to hunt you, Darren. You and the
other one. Crepsley. I’ll put a stake in you and burn you to ashes. I’ll
make sure you never come back from the grave again. WHAM. Steve walks
right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by the shoulders, pulls him
close. With a voice like Death…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: If we ever meet again, I will show you
loneliness you cannot imagine. Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go.
Steve takes off running. Crepsley looks to Darren.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Do you still question his blood?
Darrenthoughtful, doesn’t know what to think.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Would a stake through the heart kill a
vampire?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes. But so would getting hit by a truck
if it was going fast enough. Steve finally disappears from sight.
Crepsley sighs.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: He’ll be trouble before it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Before what’s over?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: This adventure we’re on. Shall we start?
Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You’ll get used to it after awhile.
Vampires are always saying goodbye. A beat, then Darren looks back at
him.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>the sun</strong>: As it blisters up into, then rises above
the horizon. Sunrise. Ominous if you’re a full vampire.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How’s that? Dark enough?</p>
<p><strong>crepley’s voice</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>crepley’s voice</strong>: I know the time. I know more about
the sunrise than anyone alive.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Maybe I’ll wait until noon and then open
every door and curtain in the place. A long tense silence as Darren
awaits Crepsley’s reply.</p>
<p><strong>motel bedroom</strong>: Crepsley is a shadow among the
shadows. He climbs into bed.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes, sunlight would kill me. My electrons
are different than a human’s. But it would take several hours of
exposure. I’d have plenty of time to kill you before I closed the
curtains and went back to bed. Crepsley pulls the blanket up over his
head.</p>
<p><strong>motel living room</strong>: As Darren considers this…</p>
<p><strong>doorway - later</strong>: Darren doing pull-ups, a hand on
either side of the top jamb.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Minnesota… Darren jots this state down on a
LIST he’s keeping. About twenty state license plates so far.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: We can die violently. Accidentally or
otherwise. But we also grow old. A full vampire will age one year for
every ten human years he’s alive. A half-vampire like you: one for every
five.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I was born in 1774. I became – Crepsley
looks back to where Darren has stopped short.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Should we do the math or not? Darren nods.
Crepsley motions him to keep up.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I became a vampire when I was 20 years
old. In 1794.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: In Paris. The days of the Terror. Heads in
baskets. Guillotines up and down all day. Really when humans put their
minds to it, we vampires can hardly compete.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Math. 1794. So I’ve been a vampire now for
211 years. Hmm? Darren nods again, still with him.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211 divided
by 10, I’ve aged about 21 years in that time. That 21 plus my first
human 20 makes me look about 40.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: But altogether you’re 211 plus 20. You’re
really 231 years old.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Exactly. You’re going to be a teenager for
a very long time. They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this
over.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Where do you keep your car anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What car?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The one you were driving around my town in.
The old black one.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’ve never owned a car, Darren. I don’t
need one.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It was near school one day. It followed me
home a few days later.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: And you saw me behind the wheel?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I couldn’t see who was driving.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: It wasn’t me. As Darren considers this,
Crepsley stops suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: There… Ahead: just more parking lot. A
WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Dinner.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes? Only nobody’s there. She shrugs it off,
closes the back door. But hesitates at the driver’s side door. Then she
starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; crepsley</strong>: Watch from a dumpster by the
loading dock. She walks right toward them. One look at Crepsley’s face
and we know he must be willing her over. Darren looks terrified. But the
air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared. The woman steps up, stops
across from Darren. As she frowns, tries to figure out who he is and how
she got here…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Go. Run. But Crepsley appears beside her. He
‘breathes’ into his hand, ‘guides’ the air into her face. He catches her
as she passes out. Darren is horrified.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I put her to sleep. She’ll be like this 15
minutes. When she wakes up, she won’t remember a thing.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Will she become a vampire?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No. She’d have to share y blood for that
to happen.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Don’t take too much.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: A vampire who feeds often can control
himself. One who drinks only when he must can end up feeding wildly. He
uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The hunger inside us must be fed to be
controlled. To be civilized. It’s what separates us from… the
others.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What others? But as blood oozes, he takes
the woman’s wrist td his mouth. Darren is repulsed, but can’t look away.
Crepsley takes a few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to
Darren.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Darren…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’ll never do it. Crepsley runs his tongue
over the cut, rubs the saliva in.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You can lead a vampire to blood, but you
can’t make him drink.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m only half-vampire.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No matter, you need blood to live now.
You’ll drink eventually. When you’re hungry enough. The wrist is clean,
the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’ll die first.</p>
<p>****: Don’t be stupid. You may abstain tonight, but you must feed
soon. Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks about,
more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What is it? As the woman starts to stir…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Nothing. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Something out there scares you. What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The thought of spending another minute
with you. Crepsley turns and walks, but Darren’s right.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: We still need to eat food, too. I just
don’t need it tonight. Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin
to run down his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The blood… I wanted it. I wanted to drink
it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Of course you did! You’re a Crepsley
catches himself. He is not without some compassion.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’m sorry. It was wrong of me to blood
you. You’re too young. But it’s done. Like the entire history of the
world up to this moment. Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper
napkins from the dispenser, hands them to him.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Thank you. Darren turns to face the window
as he wipes his eyes, nose. Then he sees it: parked across and down the
street… A black 1966 Lincoln Continental. Darren looks back at
Crepsley.</p>
<p>****: Eat. Let’s not waste anymore food tonight.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The car… Crepsley follows the finger as
Darren points. DING DING! The bell over the diner door rings…</p>
<p><strong>close on darren</strong>: As he looks back over his shoulder
at the door.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: MR. TINY comes through the front door
pimpin’. Peter Lorre on steroids. Scary, done up like a Las Vegas high
roller.</p>
<p><strong>table</strong>: Darren knows trouble when he sees it. He
looks back at Crepsley, but the vampire is gone! Vanished.</p>
<p>****: Darren Shan, we meet at last. Darren just looks up at him. The
guy is practically leaking nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to
be.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: You’re quite a boy. Sacrificed everything
to save a friend.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Where’d you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: A little bat told me. Mr. Tiny takes a
french fry off Darren’s plate, eats it. Darren looks around. Where the
hell did Crepsley go at a time like this? Mr. Tiny knows what he’s
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Oh, he’s still here.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Crepsley. Trying to stay alive. It’s so
quiet around them Darren can hear a clock TICKING. It’s a heart shaped
POCKET WATCH Mr. Tiny holds on a chain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Would you like to see?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: See what? The air seems to buzz as something
‘passes’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Why the fight of course. Boys like to
watch fights, don’t they? Mr. Tiny hefts his watch. It almost seems to
melt into his palm. As he pulls the winding knob out with a CLICK… As
Darren and Mr. Tiny blink out, disappear from the booth…</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Smell the blood. The lovely blood. His
eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening to show two
rows of sharp filthy teeth. Darren needs to do something. He eyes the
watch in Mr. Tiny’s hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view… The WINDOW EXPLODES
as Sinewy Two hurtles out. Darren tosses the watch high in the air.
Mr. Tiny releases him to move to catch it. Darren rushes back toward the
restaurant. Mr. Tiny catches his watch. Crepsley meets Darren.
Crepsley’s broken arm hangs uselessly from his side. Murlough appears
alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat, lifts him off the ground.
Crepsley arcs the knife into Murlough’s shoulder. Murlough staggers,
lets go.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: Murlough follows. Closing ground.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s behind us! Crepsley bears down, the
buildings streaking by. But…</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Closes regardless, relentless, death in
his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Almost out of gas. But looking ahead.
Clocks in an instant: a RED LIGHT AHEAD. Cars STOPPED. A CAR FROZEN
having just crossed the INTERSECTION. HEADLIGHTS from a blind corner.
Crepsley slows. Just as Murlough’s about to catch him from behind…
Crepsley comes out of flit mode, disappears. As Murlough FADES after
him.</p>
<p>****: Hey, man, are you okay?! He stops short when he sees Murlough’s
face. Murlough stands, SWATS the driver aside. The Lincoln screeches to
a halt alongside him. Murlough climbs in. The Lincoln tearing away.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Find a blanket. A rug. Cover it.</p>
<p><strong>root cellar</strong>: It goes black except for a glint in
Crepsley’s eyes. He sighs, settles down on the ground. Worn out.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s voice</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: My arm’s broken. But it should be fine in
a day or two.</p>
<p><strong>intercut the following:</strong>: Sunlight fills the kitchen.
Darren sits, exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Who were they? Vampires?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No. The one with the watch was Mr. Tiny.
Very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How dangerous can a man named Mr. Tiny
be?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Who said he was a man?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Then what is he?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Mr. Tiny can’t be explained. He needs to
be experienced.</p>
<p>****: And the purple guy. What was he?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: A vampaneze.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Yeah? Keep talking.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Long ago humans were looked upon as
animals by some vampires. Cattle to be slaughtered. Laws were passed to
forbid needless killing. It made it easier to pass unnoticed among
humans if we didn’t murder them. Most vampires obeyed…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: But some didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Seventy vampires broke away, declared
themselves a separate race. The Vampaneze. Over time their appearance
changed, their numbers grew. They believe it’s wrong to feed from a
human without killing it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What? That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: They believe those of us who feed in small
amounts live like leeches. In shame. It led to war. Crepsley touches the
scar on his face, remembers.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: The last one nearly destroyed us all.
There’s been a truce for many years now.</p>
<p>****: Will you be alright while I sleep? Darren looks around at the
dilapidated crap heap he’s in. As he tries to hold his heart
together…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh yeah… This is so much better than where I
used to be… Crepsley hears the strain in his voice. Knows what’s best
for both of them..</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What do you think of rejoining the Cirque
du Freak? Until you get on your vampire feet so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Half vampire.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes, yes. Three-eighths if you want. What
do you think? As Darren thinks…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Show time in twenty minutes. Someone tell
Rhamus to get his stomachs in gear! He’s surprised to see Crepsley and
Darren walk up the road. Crepsley’s arm seems much better now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Larten’Crepsley! As I live and breathe. I
thought it would be years before I saw you again. Mr. Tall looks to
Darren, throws a surprised look to Crepsley. Crepsley nods. ‘Yes’.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Darren Shan. You’ve come a long way since
the last time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I liked it better where I was.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Do you still have my coffin?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Of course. You’re really back?</p>
<p>****: Perhaps you could do the show tonight? A few of us are absent
or ill this evening.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’d be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Mr. Shan will have to pull his weight as
well. I’ll give him to Evra. Evra! EVRA!</p>
<p>****: I hope I haven’t gone from one unreliable boy to two.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Evra, my industrious wonder. Here is
Darren. Put him to work with you. Show him the snakey ropes. As the two
boys consider each other…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Off with you. Go! As the boys head off,
Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: You blooded a child, Larten? What were you
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You don’t approve?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: I don’t matter. What will the vampire
generals say when they hear about it?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’m no longer part of their domain.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: So you say. They may disagree.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: What do you do? Me? I’m a snake boy. I do a
whole snake thing. Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps
to illustrate. It’s strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Do you eat mice?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Big Macs actually. They share a LAUGH. Evra
‘high fives’ Darren. Fast friends.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I caught your act in the last town. Pretty
cool.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Thanks. I’m not doing it tonight. My snake
caught a cold.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Snakes can catch cold? Evra nods, then
SNEEZES himself.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Still gotta work the floor though. Ushers. We
get the seats filled. They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the
camp.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Who are they all?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: The backbone of Cirque du Freak. They do the
driving, the tent pitching, the potato peeling even.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How did they end up here?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Most wandered in. If Mr. Tall likes them, they
stay. Darren’s eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He’s being pushed toward
the factory building by several of the blue-robed LITTLE PEOPLE. The
wolfman’s yellow eyes are on Darren as he rumbles a low, guttural growl.
Darren is so taken that he almost walks into… Madam Truska. He stops
short. In costume, beardless, even more beautiful than when we first saw
her. She considers Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes
her head, smiles. As she continues…</p>
<p><strong>debbie &amp; sam</strong>: About the same age as Darren and
Evra, they’re here for the show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is
sarcastic to cover his insecurities. Right now it’s hard to find a seat.
And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green sharkskin,
Darren still wearing his burial suit.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Can we help you find a seat?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Are there any left?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Only the best seats in the house. He leads
them a few steps over toward a column.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You guys are with the Cirque? Darren nods.
Sam’s a little sarcastic and skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Cirque is French, right? Are you guys
French?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous sommes les
serpents frangais. That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small
platform eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Cool… I’m Debbie, this is Sam.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Evra Von. She looks at Darren, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh, I’m Darren.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Is the show great? Say yes. We had to sneak
out to see it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I snuck out to see it once, too. And I’m
still here. An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Good one, Darren. Hey. Debbie and Darren. Like
Bonnie and Clyde. And their friend Evra Von what? That breaks the
moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar. Sam looks Darren over a beat,
picks a thread off his lapel.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dude, it looks like the kind of suit you’d wear
to a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You have no idea… Evra smiles, sticks out
his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries
to smile, then starts up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra
laugh…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We are an
ancient circus. Bringing the remarkable to generations…</p>
<p><strong>back row</strong>: Darren and Evra watch from the back,
whisper to each other.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How long have you known Mr. Tall?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Five years.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How do you meet someone like him?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: I was raised in a circus, but not a nice one
like this. The owner used to beat me and keep me in a glass cage. I felt
like a useless freak. One night I looked out of my cage and saw Mr. Tall
just standing there. He watched me until the owner came over and asked
if he could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed him by the throat and strangled
him to death. Then he opened the cage and said, “Let’s go, Evra.” He
named me that. I added the Von. I’ve been with him ever since. Darren
looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley’s voice</strong>: Darren… Darren turns. Crepsley’s
back there in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: How do you feel about show business?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: To be poisoned by a spider may be my fate.
It’s Darren’s cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit, he walks out
carrying Madam Octa’s cage at arm’s length.</p>
<p><strong>debbie &amp; sam</strong>: As she realizes it’s Darren.
Cool.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Darren sees Debbie who gives a little wave.
As he smiles…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Look glum… Miserable…</p>
<p><strong>a bonfire</strong>: Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The
freaks are eating, drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy
camp. Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
watching everyone else enjoy themselves. Evra munches on a sausage he
grills on the end of a stick. Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes
these people. And he’s certainly never experienced anything like this.
Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum. Madam Truska
starts to dance, the fire flickering against her as are all eyes. Then
she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the hand. A few moments later, the
two of them are engaged in a mad TANGO. It takes the camp’s collective
breath away. Even Darren can’t help but enjoy it. Crepsley’s arm gives
him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Almost done. Crepsley looks to the sky.
Still dark. The moon setting.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Darren…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’m not going to sleep here. We’ll find a
nook in the factory. Crepsley starts off. Darren starts to follow.</p>
<p><strong>crespley</strong>: Mattress. Darren sighs, goes back to the
van to retrieve the mattress. He starts to pull it out, then stops,
nearly doubled over. Concerned, Crepsley steps over. Darren waves him
off, straightens as whatever it was passes.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I just felt sick for a second.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You need blood. Darren gives him a dirty
look, grabs the mattress. They start walking toward the factory.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You think Mr. Tiny might come? Crepsley
shrugs, doesn’t answer.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Who is he? What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What we want is who we are, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Can’t you give me a straight answer just
once?!</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You won’t learn by me telling you. You
must live some things to know what they are. Darren sighs in deep
frustration. Crepsley has a thought.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Okay. Why do you like spiders?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Did you ever think there was a particular
reason? It seems Crepsley knows the answer even if Darren doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No. I never thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: That’s the trouble with children. They
don’t think about things.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m not a child. Theystop by the
shadows.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Are you a man? If you’re not a man, you’re
a child.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m in between.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: In between does not exist! The words echo
a moment. Darren no closer to understanding.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’ll sleep in here tonight. But sit
outside the van tomorrow and make it look like I’m there. It’s just
caution. Old habits die hard.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And old vampires? Without a sound, someone
has reached around the two of them from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to
each of their throats. They stand dead still. We can make out the shape
of a head as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Gavner Purl, as always I heard you coming
from a mile away. CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a
thin SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We’ll call it a draw then. The ‘voice’ pulls
back his knives, steps out. It’s GAVNER PURL. He was once handsome, but
those days are long gone. His face is crossed with scars. They vary in
size, thickness and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: It’s been too long, Larten.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Decades now. They embrace. Darren’s trying
to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You guys are friends?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: I suppose. We once shared a coffin
together. For six months.</p>
<p>****: Like roommates? To save money?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: We were being hunted.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Who was hunting you?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl. Gavner
extends his hand to shake. Darren sees’the scars on Gavner Purl’s
fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so Gavner can see his scars.
Gavner looks at Crepsley.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: A half-vampire?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Of course. We don’t make full vampires of
our assistants. Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Nor do we make assistants of
children.</p>
<p>****: A child, Larten? Why?!</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I have my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: And they are?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I don’t owe answers to vampires anymore.
I’m exiled from our kind</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Self-exiled. And I at least am owed an
answer. There’s a personal history being called upon here. Crepsley is
well aware. Darren again is left out.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: All I care to say is a boy sought me out,
knew who I was. He asked me to make him my assistant. Gavner looks to
Darren, suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: And how did you know –</p>
<p>****: It wasn’t Darren. Another boy. His blood was bad. I should have
killed him, but I didn’t. Darren reacts. Gavner considers it all.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I met Darren shortly after. His blood was
good or I certainly would have killed him. Darren reacts again.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: How could a boy find you? Crepsley
shrugs. Of course he had help.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Tiny?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He tried to kill us.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: He tried to kill me. What he wanted with
you wasn’t determined.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Perhaps you chose the wrong boy. In
Mr. Tiny’s eyes. A moment as they consider the unspoken
implications.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What are you guys talking about!? No answer
as Crepsley and Gavner lock each other in a look.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What’s important enough to track down an
exile? What is your news?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: War.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’m not interested in your wars.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Well the other side is interested or
they wouldn’t be trying to get rid of you. Crepsley gets suddenly very
angry.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’ve had enough killing! No more! You’ve
come to the wrong place. I am the wrong place… Gavner raises his hands
in surrender.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Even so, I’m glad you’re alive.</p>
<p>****: The sun is coming. Will you stay?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: I can still make miles. The war won’t
wait. And neither will bad news. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Then travel safely.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Would you mind if I walk a bit with
your assistant?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Take him with you if you want. He’s of
little use to me.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: You look sick. Doesn’t Larten feed
you?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I won’t drink blood if that’s what you mean.
I promised myself.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’ll get insulted. As Gavner waits for
Darren to tell him…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m afraid if I drink blood, I’ll become
evil. Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: The only thing drinking blood will do
to you is keep you alive.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That’s how it would start. I would swear it
was just to stay alive. But what’ll I turn into? You’re on one side of
the fence or the other. My father used to say that and now I know what
he meant. The ‘father part’ chokes Darren up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: You’ve already turned, Darren. You need
to accept what you’ve already become. There’s no going back. They walk
in silence a moment. Then:</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Why did Crepsley make himself an exile
anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: He was tired of all the killing. We
were at war.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: With the vampaneze?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Crepsley was once a Vampire General.
One of our great leaders. He may seem reluctant, but I assure you, no
one is as skilled at killing vampaneze than Crepsley is. I think that’s
why they’d like to get him out of the way. Kill him off before the new
war starts.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’ve known him a long time?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: I was his assistant. He blooded me, as
he blooded you. There’s almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Why’d he choose you?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up until
now, it’s the only reason he ever chooses anyone.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Is it why he chose me? Gavner hesitates, not
sure.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: That’s for Crepsley to say. Not me.
Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Do you know what the biggest danger is
to a vampire, Darren?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: No. It’s that they live so long they no
longer care. Everything they love is left behind until they finally have
nothing left to live for. Except death. The fact that he’s taken an
apprentice seems, to me, a good sign. A sign that he’s thinking of
living not dying.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Lucky for me. Glad I could help. All the
same Darren considers what he’s heard. Gavner, meanwhile, considers the
open countryside ahead.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: A clear run. Good. Gavner gives Darren
one last appraising look.</p>
<p><strong>gavner purl</strong>: Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his image
bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating up. And then he’s
gone.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That part is definitely cool.</p>
<p>****: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p>****: It’s smells like burnt hair.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Don’t know. I’m congested.</p>
<p>****: Hey… Evra follows his gaze, turns just in time to see:</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: Debbie and Sam ducking inside the
factory.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; evra</strong>: Exchange a look. Start after
them.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Let’s scare the crap out of him… They begin to
creep in, flanking the unsuspecting Sam. But as they get close, a SHAPE
drops down behind them!</p>
<p><strong>arrrgggh!</strong>: Darren and Evra are the ones who jump.
The shape is Debbie! She almost falls over laughing. So does Sam.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You should see the look on your faces. But
Evra and Darren are not laughing.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: What’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We could ask you the same thing. We come
here all the time. My grandfather used to work here.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Must’ve been a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He says now it’s like one of those bombed
out World War II cathedrals. Empty of what is used to be. An odd little
moment till Sam breaks it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey, we loved the show, man. It was off the
hook.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Off the hook, huh? I’ll tell all the freaks
you said so.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you guys on your own? Just traveling. No
parents or nothing?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No. No parents. He says it with a little
twinge that Debbie picks up on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: School?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: No school either.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re the luckiest guys on earth. Wanna switch
places?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You have to be different to be here.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Different how? Evra steps into a slash of
sunlight and his skin flashes to life, the green of his scales catching
the rays. Debbie’s mouth drops. They couldn’t see it in the dark last
night.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Everyone has a place they belong. The Cirque
du Freak is ours.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I think your skin is beautiful. That wins
Evra over.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Can I touch it? Evra holds out his arm.
Debbie traces a finger across it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Wow. Has it always been this way?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He’s a snake-boy.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You shouldn’t call him names because he
looks different.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: It’s okay. I am a snake boy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You could say you’re dermatologically
challenged. They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then
Darren.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: What about you, Darren? How are you
different?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I get scared easy. Darren looks up toward
the rafters. From where she dropped.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: How’d you get up there anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You mean, how did a girl get up there?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Hey, be careful.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t worry. She’s like a gymnast. Debbie moves
slowly at first, her arms stretched out for balance. Then she does a
hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp. She gets to the other side, turns and
bows.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I got nothing to prove.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: But it’d be easier for you than me.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Because chickens have wings. She starts
chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a rafter, starts across. He
stops in the middle, spins around. Aided immeasurably by his
half-vampire skills.</p>
<p><strong>angle overhead</strong>: The vertigo angle as Debbie walks
back out on her rafter. Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; debbie</strong>: Darren crosses his arms across
his chest. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Let’s play mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I do something and you have to copy me. Like
this. Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He uncrosses them
as he realizes. Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs,
then does the same, gets a good look at the floor below. Debbie takes
one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top of it with one hand,
raising the other arm out for balance. Looks like a ballerina. Evra
doesn’t like this daredevil stuff.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Come on, guys… Darren hesitates. Not because
he won’t do it, but because maybe for the first time in his life, he’s
really fascinated by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly. Without warning, Debbie
leaps the gap, lands on the rafter alongside Darren. As she struggles a
bit for balance, Darren reaches out and steadies her. As they come face
to face.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: There definitely something different about
you. I just can’t figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Is Sam your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He’s my cousin.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh… A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter.
Finally…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: We should get off this. She nods, a bit
smitten. Darren turns. As they start off…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything
starts spinning.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: The area is like a big drain and he’s
whirling down it.</p>
<p><strong>rafter</strong>: Darren legs go out and he falls off. As
Debbie screams… Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past
it.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hold on. Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts
out to help, but the rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the
obvious.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t think it’ll hold you, dude.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Thanks for the heads up… Bro.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s okay. I’m okay. Darren swings up a leg,
hooks it over the rafter. A beat and he’s back on top. Debbie relieved.
Evra backs up the way he came and in a few seconds they’re all safely
off the rafter.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I don’t know how you hung on. I couldn’t
have.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You wouldn’t have fallen in the first place…
I just got dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Maybe you need to eat something. Darren
looks at her. She has no idea.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Well, the food’s down on ground level. Let’s
get out of here. Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As
Sam and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: She’s kind’of cool, huh? I mean, for a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: I like her. She asks a lot of questions
though.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: She’s just curious.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: There’s no such thing as ‘just’ with a
girl.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What makes you such an expert?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: My snake’s a girl.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Good morning, Darren.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What’s good about it? Crepsley looks him
over, doesn’t like what he sees.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with
him.</p>
<p><strong>sam debbie</strong>: Hey, Darren. Hi… Darren’s happy to see
them.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You guys are coming to the show again
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Of course. Evra’s doing his snake act
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh, you came to see Evra.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: And you… Darren smiles shyly at that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I was hoping for Amanda Bynes. Darren sees
Crepsley watching him from the tent.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Hey, I’ll catch up with you later. I got
some stuff I gotta finish up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s gonna be gone in another day or two.
Tonight’s the last show.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: I know that. So?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So stop looking at him like you love him.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: You’re such an idiot, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>tent opening</strong>: Darren joins Crepsley, a little
unsteady.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Look at you. You can barely stand.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You need to feed. You need blood..</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No! I won’t let you hunt some poor person
down for me. I – Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into…</p>
<p><strong>the tent</strong>: Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered.
Medieval.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No need to hunt. There’s someone here
willing to save you. From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly
beautiful. She steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her
wrist.</p>
<p><strong>madam truska</strong>: By my own free will, Darren Shan. As
Crepsley’s fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein. Darren shakes his
head. ‘No’.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Drink or you’ll die.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No. I can’t. I’m human. Crepsley releases
Truska’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: You’re not! And you’ll be nothing! Darren
stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I am human. In my heart I am. A great big
TEAR rolls down Truska’s cheek. That’s the last thing Crepsley needed to
see. He’s defeated.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: An usher in the house of usher. And I can’t
seem to find a seat. Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the
aisle.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: This way. Darren brings him down to a
handful of seats. The figure looks up from under the brim of his hat.
It’s Mr. Tiny.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Join me.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I don’t think so. As Darren moves to go,
Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling
Darren down beside him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: It’s time we had a few moments. Folks
involved in epic struggles should get to know each other. Darren doesn’t
answer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Has Crepsley told you about me? Explained
me?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He said you can’t be explained. You need to
be experienced.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: He gives me too much credit.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Hey, Darren. Darren looks up to see Debbie
and Sam. Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: We’re gonna sit on this side.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Cuz we miss you so much. She digs Sam with her
elbow. They sit just a row in front.</p>
<p>****: Choosing sides can only lead to trouble. Never, ever choose
sides unless it’s your own.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You’ve chosen the vampaneze. Mr. Tiny
laughs, slaps his knee even.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Is that really what you think? A smart boy
like you? And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.</p>
<p><strong>on the stage</strong>: The little people wheel out a CAGE.
There’s a gurgled GROWL. The little people retreat. Several audience
members lean in, then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the
cage.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: .subjugators and saps…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Welcome to the Cirque du Freak. We are an
ancient circus… As Mr. Tall drones on…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Oh, his speeches are impossible. Mr. Tiny
opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into view from his palm.
Time begins to speed up around them. Mr. Tall’s voice speeds to a BUZZ
as he ‘keystone cops’ off the stage and Rhamus ‘keystones’ on. The
audience’s small movements become rattles and shakes. Only Darren and
Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: I’m not so complicated, Darren. During war
there are those who profit. A war between vampires and vampaneze would
have terrible consequences. Therefore…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Terrible profits.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Excellent. I am a profiteer. I exact fees
and gains. I’m simple. On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra ‘keystones’
through his performance with his snake.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Did Crepsley tell you of the prophesy?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: What prophesy?</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: They say the final battle between vampires
and vampaneze will be decided by a child. That’s why the vampires won’t
blood children. To avoid the end of the world. As these words are
pondered by Darren…</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: I think I underestimated you. I think you
could be wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I think you’re a creep. I think you
suck.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Too bad. Mr. Tiny closes his hand around
the watch. Time returns to normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to
normal speed. As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at
Darren.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: He was great! As she looks back to the stage
someone sits on Darren’s other side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a
scarf. Murlough!</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Is it Dar-wren’s girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Forget about her – Murlough takes hold of
Darren’s other wrist. Still low:</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: She has plenty of lovely blood inside.
Inside, outside, hmmm? Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close,
HISSES in his ear, flashing those filthy teeth.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: I don’t care about humans. I don’t care
about you. But the vampire - Larten Crepsley - him I care about.</p>
<p>****: Murlough is a vampire killer.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You guys are in trouble. There’s more than
one vampire now. Gavner Purl is here. Murlough reacts to the name. Does
not like it.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Have you seen Purl Gavner’s face? Young
Murlough sliced it for him.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Darren, you’re a liar. He’s a thousand
miles gone by now. And master Crepsley is right there. As he points at
Crepsley…</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Holding Madam Octa’s cage. Aware
something’s ‘in the air’.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Shimmers, phases into flit mode.
Disappears.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Crepsley! Look out! The audience LAUGHS.
Like Darren’s worried about Madam Octa. Debbie looks back, knows
something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny’s hand around Darren’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: As Murlough ‘appears’ alongside Crepsley.
Madam Octa’s cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks Crepsley fifteen
feet through the air. He lands flat on his back. The audience CHEER!
Think it’s part of the show. Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces
a razor-sharp LONG KNIFE in either hand. Crepsley pops to his feet. As
his own single BLADE ‘switches’ to life in his hand…</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; mr. tiny</strong>: As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny
switches his grip to the back of the boy’s neck. That holds him.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long
knives pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as it comes.
Sparks fly as the blades connect. From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a
BACKHAND to the mix. It catches Murlough hard across the chops.</p>
<p><strong>off stage</strong>: Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what
to do.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches
the blade in Murlough’s left hand with the one in his right. Crepsley
catches Murlough’s left wrist, the second blade dangerously close to
retracing the scar on Crepsley’s face. Crepsley throws himself back,
sending Murlough head over heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a
concrete wall.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Concentrating. Trying to flit.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It’s
brute force versus style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough’s
not so brutish after all. He matches the move – Buries one of his knives
into Crepsley’s stomach. Crepsley reacts, frozen in shock.</p>
<p><strong>darren &amp; mr. tiny</strong>: The audience around them
unsure. Many shocked. It’s part of the show, right? Darren sees Murlough
raise the other knife to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
And Mr. Tiny’s holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Speeding down to the stage. The dagger
descends in slo- motion, but it’s only a centimeter or two from it’s
target.</p>
<p><strong>stage</strong>: Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough’s back,
knocks him off target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers
left. Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears. ROARING, Murlough
grabs Darren. They disappear as well.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tiny</strong>: Sighs. This is not how it’s supposed to
go. Sam and Debbie leave their seats, head for the stage.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: His back to a wall. Trying to hold it
together. Frozen PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he’loses his flit
power, the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Reacting to Murlough’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>boiler room - factory</strong>: Murlough twists Darren’s arm.
Darren SCREAMS out in pain.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Reacting as Debbie and Sam arrive. They move
toward it.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Listening as the scream fades off.
Clutching his stomach, Crepsley moves.</p>
<p><strong>boiler room - factory</strong>: Murlough pulls Darren a
little higher. They’re face-to-face, though Darren is upsidedown.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Crepsley will come for his assistant.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He doesn’t care about me.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Murlough has an assistant, too. A smart
one, smarter than you. As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as
stepping up, grinning, is Murlough’s assistant.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Steve? Steve! Steve holds up his hands so
Darren can see the WHITE SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets
closer.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Mr. Tiny made my dream come true. Only
better. I’m half vampaneze instead of a stupid half vampire. Mr. Tiny
says I have a destiny. He says he’s gonna make sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Is that who you talked to? Was that the
internet guy? Mr. Tiny?</p>
<p>****: Pretty funny, huh? He introduced himself after you left
town.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: But, I think I’ve known him a long time in my
head. In my bad, bad blood. Chilling. Maybe Steve is evil. He leans in
even closer.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He gave me back the dream you stole. Murlough
motions Steve quiet, slaps a hand over Darren’s mouth. Listens. Smiles.
Whispers.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Crepsley comes.</p>
<p><strong>evra, debbie &amp; sam</strong>: Freeze as Crepsley looks
back in the direction from which they follow. From their POV, Crepsley
suddenly disappears.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where’d he go? They jump as Crepsley appears
right in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Evra… Get them out of here.</p>
<p><strong>but –</strong>: Evra knows it’s useless. As he nods, Crepsley
turns and strides back toward where he had been. Sam and Debbie exchange
a look. What the Hell?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: You guys better go back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Darren’s my friend.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Ours too. Sam’s not so sure, but he nods in
agreement.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s pov</strong>: Sweeping the room. Wait! It fixes on a
doorway. There’s Crepsley. Looking about, everywhere but at Darren.</p>
<p><strong>boiler room</strong>: Crepsley speaks to ‘the room’.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I can smell it. Why does it hide?</p>
<p>****: The vampire is here. WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands
ten feet in front of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each
other.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: The vampire will die.</p>
<p>****: Let’s get readyyyyy to rumble! Crepsley looks up, reacts.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Even the creatures of the night watch too
much TV. Darren swings past through the middle of it all. Murlough
charges. Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher. He
leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks. Murlough follows.
They use the room steel as monkey bars as they climb, clash. Violent,
quick attacks. Crepsley gaining a position, abandoning it as Murlough
SLAMS in.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the
battle now. He reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Sam, unhook his legs. As Sam struggles, Debbie
pulls the rag from Darren’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: It’s against our code. Suddenly unhooked,
Darren hits the ground. He looks up at Evra who grins down at him.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Never leave a freak behind.</p>
<p><strong>ceiling superstructure</strong>: On the catwalks Murlough
draws his knives. Crepsley jumps to the space he wants to defend, draws
his own. Murlough counters. Two very serious predators’-at work. The
animal kingdom at its killing best. A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley
a matador. He redirects one of Murlough’s arcing arms, smashing it
against a metal housing. One of the vampaneze’s knives clatters away.
It’s not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley’s knife finds its
way into Murlough’s body. It enrages him, but Crepsley continues dealing
out punishment. He’s now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
inadvertently backs his way into a corner. But as quarters close in,
Murlough’s rage works to his advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his
lowered shoulder sending Crepsley through the air and into… And through
a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still raging, Murlough nearly
falls through himself. Instead, he slips, drops about twenty feet down
inside the building!</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Evra. I think I’m dying. He looks
horrible.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Let’s carry him if we have to. Evra and Sam
support him on either side. They continue, start across part of a
darkened backstage area. A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a
GUTTURAL GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: It’s okay. It’s the wolfman. He’s in his cage.
They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But another SHAPE
beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the cage’s heavy latch. He’s going
to open it.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: No don’t!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ooops… Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn’t
expect the force the wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It’s out.
Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying. Sam can’t hold
Darren up by himself. He doesn’t even see the Wolfman leap over. As
Darren sinks to the floor… The wolfman tears into Sam…</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Reacts in horror.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: He’s more surprised than shocked. Until the
wolfman looks his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie. She backs away, takes off up
a rickety stairway. The wolfman HOWLS, then follows. Darren’s too weak
to follow, near tears in frustration and regret. He watches after them,
then he looks over at Sam. Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His
eyes flicker to Darren’s. He tries to say something, but can’t.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Oh Sam. Oh no… Darren crawls over, takes
Sam’s bloody hand.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Go save Debbie, Darren… Sam manages the
smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think she loves you… From above, we hear
Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam’s blood, knows what he has to do.
Leave his humanity behind and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam’s
blood.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Forgive me, Sam, but I need strength. I need
blood. As Darren extends his nails over Sam’s wrist…</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: We’re going to save her together.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Is Crepsley dead?</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: Who knows? Young Murlough lives, but he’s
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: What can Dar-wren’s girlfriend do? We need
to get the blood inside outside. Don’t we? Then we hear it: a
blood-curdling scream filters up. It’s:</p>
<p><strong>darren! - backstage area</strong>: He’s drunk Sam’s blood. He
rises. His sickness wicking off him. Strength descending. Empowered.
Furious. He screams again, the sound taking shape into words.</p>
<p><strong>factory stage space</strong>: The audience who haven’t left
react as the chilling sound reaches them.</p>
<p><strong>backstage area - factory</strong>: Fully 1/2 vampire powered,
he takes the stairs two at a time.</p>
<p><strong>upper floor</strong>: Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles
as Darren arrives.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Stop being a big shot. This isn’t like
stopping some fight at school.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Shut up, Steve.</p>
<p><strong>murlough</strong>: You need to stand still so you can die.
But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can’t. He frowns.
Then his eyes widen in pain. Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he
can. The wall smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>factory space</strong>: The audience who remain chanting:
“Refund! Refund!” They react as debris falls from above, smashes to the
stage.</p>
<p><strong>upper floor - factory</strong>: Crepsley brings up his knife.
Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand. With the other he grips
Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him hard into an I-beam pillar. Again.
Then he squeezes. We can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley’s
throat. But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He drives
the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH’S HEART! Murlough looks down at the handle
of the knife, then back at Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back, falling
through one of the holes in the floor. Taking Crepsley with him.</p>
<p><strong>factory space</strong>: SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough
descends. Somewhere in mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When
Murlough hits the center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead. As people
start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny’is among them.</p>
<p><strong>upper floor</strong>: But as Darren stands, it’s not over.
Steve grabs Debbie, pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Stay back! Or I’ll throw her off! I mean it!
It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie. She looks back.
Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS. Understanding, Debbie tears
herself away. To the precipice. But instead of falling, she continues
out on a rafter. Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her,
she deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor. Before
Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them: rows of jagged, rusty
pipes. The remains of a pumping station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting
to impale.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s over, Steve.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Is it? Steve lunges. They come together,
trading shots, stumbling but still having to make the rafters. A missed
footfall will be their last. They separate, try to gain position.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You wanna hear something funny? After your
funeral, I went to see your parents. They continue circling.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: And they were fine. They acted like they
barely remembered you.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p>****: And your sister. She was moving into your room. They had a yard
sale. I bought some of your stuff. Steve’s foot on his hand. Darren
about to die. Oddly:</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Did you steal money from my mom’s purse?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Did you? Darren hanging there, dead grim.
Steve’s curious.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Why do you ask? Is knowing that gonna help
you rest in peace?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: No. It’s just practically the last thing
that ever happened between me and my dad was I was arguing with him.</p>
<p>****: Least you had a dad to argue with. A fury building in
Darren.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I was telling him he was wrong about you.
That’s the last time we had together. Fighting about you.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Hate to tell ya. Your dad was right. How do
you think we got the money for the dumb tickets? I took it. Just like
I’m gonna take you. Steve jams his foot down into Darren’s face, but
Darren hangs on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
no matter how many times Steve hits him.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I miss him.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: I miss him so much. WHAM! Steve’s arm
pinwheel for balance. He’s going over. But just as he pitches off the
end rafter… Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will fall into the
spikes below. Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should
do.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you won’t
have to do it later. Darren looks at Steve. A moment they’ll remember
forever.</p>
<p>****: No. He used to be my friend. Darren flings Steve back the other
way. To safety.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Start running. Don’t ever stop. Steve
hesitates. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Darren starts off the
rafter toward him. One last look of hate.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Next time… And he’s gone. Disappearing into
the dark. Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Sam? Darren shakes his head. Sam didn’t make
it.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Are you gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I just need to catch my breath. For a few
days. Maybe a week.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You think I made a mistake, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: No. I think that you proved yourself human
after all. Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Half human. What now?</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: There’s a war on, isn’t there? Crepsley
shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: This world is crossed by fences. You have to
decide which side you stand on.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Yes, yes. Black and white fences crossing
very gray fields.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: It’s not gray. I’ve met the bad guys. They
need to be stopped.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: I’m not sure it’s my fight.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: But you said it. There’s no in between. And
the power of being alone is never going to be greater than the weakness.
It’s our fight.</p>
<p>****: He was a good kid. It’s weird, but I remember things about him
even though I wasn’t there when they happened. Even though it’s
impossible. A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular
boy.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: His blood is in you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: I’ll deal with the police when they come.
What I’ll say, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>debbie</strong>: Say what happened. Some crazy guy showed up.
Sam was in the wrong place at the wrong time. They’re all quiet a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>evra</strong>: He was brave.</p>
<p>****: For the only time in his life.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: He didn’t die in vain. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>mr. tall</strong>: Time to fly or flit or whatever you call
it. The sun won’t wait all night.</p>
<p><strong>crepsley</strong>: Actually, that’s exactly what it does.
Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.</p>
