<p><strong>ben</strong>: - and today it is right that we should ask
ourselves the one most important question: What is the purpose of these
years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the
sacrifices made those who love us? Were there NOT a purpose, then all of
these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom-
promising ambition would be mean- ingless. But, of course, there is a
purpose and I must tell it to you. I ask you to remember this purpose
always and I pledge that I shall endeavor to carry it with me
forever.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The purpose, my fellow graduates - the purpose
is -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - there is a reason, my friends, and the reason
is -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - the reason is - the purpose is -</p>
<p><strong>captain’s voice</strong>: The sound you have just heard is
the landing gear locking into place. The Los Angeles weather is clear
and the temperature is a pleasant 72. We do not expect any traffic delay
and will make our four hour and eighteen minute flight plan smack on the
nose. We enjoyed having you on board and look forward to seeing you
again in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess’ voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen please
fasten your seat belts in preparation for the landing and observe the no
smoking sign. After we land, you will notice an increase in the sound
level as the thrust of the engines is reversed to help reduce forward
speed.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Your attention, please! American
Airlines Flight Number 4, 21 Club service, non-stop to New York is now
leaving from Gate Number 40. All aboard, please.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: The guests are all downstairs,
Ben. They’re all waiting to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, Dad - could you explain to them that I
have to be alone for a while?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: These are all our good
friends, Ben. Most of them have known you since - well - practically
since you were born.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: What is it, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m just -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: - worried?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know. I want it to be -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: To be what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Different.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: No! No - we’re just on our way
downstairs!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: The Carlsons’ are here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: They are? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: They came all the way from
Tarzana.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: It’s a wonderful thing to have so many
devoted friends.</p>
<p><strong>mr. carlson</strong>: Hey - there’s our award winning
scholar.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carlson</strong>: We’re all very proud of you, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. carlson</strong>: Is that the new car out there? The
little red Wop job?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: That’s Ben’s graduation present.</p>
<p><strong>mr. carlson</strong>: Won’t have much trouble picking them up
in that, will you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. carlson</strong>: The girls. The chicks. The - the teeny
boppers.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. carlson</strong>: I think Ben has gotten beyond the
teeny bopper stage - haven’t you, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me - I think I’d just like to check
something on the car for a minute -</p>
<p><strong>mr. loomis</strong>: Here’s the track star himself. How are
you, track star?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Just fine, Mr. Loomis.</p>
<p><strong>mr. loomis</strong>: I want to get a drink and then I want to
hear all about that thing you won. That Hopperman award.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Helpingham.</p>
<p><strong>mr. loomis</strong>: Helpingham! Right! Now you wait right
here.</p>
<p><strong>lady 1</strong>: Ben - we’re all so proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>lady 2</strong>: Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.</p>
<p><strong>lady 3</strong>: What are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was going to go upstairs for a minute -</p>
<p><strong>lady 3</strong>: No - I meant with your future.</p>
<p><strong>lady 2</strong>: With your life.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - that’s a little hard to say -</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Ben!</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mr. McQuire.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Ben - I just want to say one word to
you - just one word -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Are you listening?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Plastics.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Exactly how do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: There is a great future in plastics.
Think about it. Will you think about it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
<p><strong>mr. mcquire</strong>: Okay. Enough said. That’s a deal.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Here he is now. Here’s Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Excuse me just a minute -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Oh. I guess this isn’t the bathroom,
is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: How are you, Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the
end of the hall.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don’t mean to be rude
but -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Is there an ashtray in here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Oh - I forgot. The track star doesn’t
smoke.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Is it a girl?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is what a girl?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Whatever it is you’re upset
about.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - no. I’m just sort of disturbed about
things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: In general.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, I want to ask you
something.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Will you take me home?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: My husband took the car. Will you
drive me home?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here - you take it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you know how to work a foreign shift?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Dad - Mrs. Robinson needs a ride home. I’ll be
right back.</p>
<p>****: Wonderful party.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Will you come in, please?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I want you to come in till I get the
lights on.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Because I don’t feel safe until I get
the lights on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Would you mind walking ahead of me to
the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But it’s light in there now.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What do you drink? Bourbon?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - I drove you home. I was glad to do it.
But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right then.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What do you drink?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin - I’m sorry to be this way,
but I don’t want to be alone in this house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Please wait till my husband gets
home.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When is he coming back?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you always this much afraid of being
alone?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, why can’t you just lock the doors and go
to bed?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’m very nuerotic.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: May I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What do you think of me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You’ve known me nearly all of your
life. You must have formed some opinion.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I’ve always thought that you were a very
- nice - person.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Did you know I was an alcoholic?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - I think I should be going -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Sit down, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson - if you don’t mind my saying so
- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I’m sure that
Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: My husband will be back quite
late.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: He should be gone for several
hours.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson, you didn’t - I mean you didn’t
expect -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean - you didn’t really think that I would
do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: For God’s sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are,
you’ve got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music,
now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your
husband won’t be home for hours.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson - you are trying to seduce
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Why no. I hadn’t thought of it. I
feel rather flattered that you -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I
just said?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not all right, it’s the worst thing I’ve
ever said to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don’t
think of you that way. But I’m mixed up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: All right. Now finish your drink.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said
that to you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: We’ll forget it right now. Finish
your drink.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What is wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Have you ever seen Elaine’s
portrait?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Her portrait?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: We had it done last Christmas. Would
you like to see it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t remember her as having brown eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Will you unzip my dress?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I think I’ll go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Well, goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Won’t you unzip my dress?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d rather not, Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: If you still think I’m trying to
seduce you -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I don’t. But I just feel a little
funny.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin - you’ve known me all your
life.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know that. But I’m -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: It’s hard for me to reach.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What are you so scared of?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not scared, Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Then why do you keep running
away?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because you’re going to bed. I don’t think I
should be up here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Haven’t you ever seen anybody in a
slip before?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, I have -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But I just - Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked
in right now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What if he did?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t you think he trusts us
together?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course he does. But he might get the wrong
idea. Anyone might.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t see why. I’m twice as old as
you are. How could anyone think -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But they would! Don’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin - I’m not trying to seduce
you. I wish you’d -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is
difficult for me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Why is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I am confused about things. I can’t
tell what I’m imagining. I can’t tell what’s real. I can’t -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Would you like me to seduce you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Is that what you’re trying to tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going home now. I apologize for what I
said. I hope you can forget it. But I’m going home right now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Will you bring up my purse
before you go?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I have to go now. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I really don’t want to put this on
again. Won’t you bring it up?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: On that chair in the hall.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: I’m in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well here’s the purse.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Could you bring it up?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well I’ll hand it to you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come to the railing and I’ll hand it up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Benjamin - I am getting
pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won’t do me a simple
favor I don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m putting it on the top step.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: For God’s sake, Benjamin,
will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m putting it here by the door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Will you bring it in to
me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d rather not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: All right. Put it in the room
where we were.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let me out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t be nervous.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Get away from that door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I want to say something first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin - I want you to know I’m
available to you. If you won’t sleep with me this time -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: If you won’t sleep with me this time,
Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and
we’ll make some kind of arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you understand what I said?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. Yes. Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Because I find you very attractive
and any time -</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson’s voice</strong>: Is that Ben’s car in
front?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She
wanted me to drive her home so I - I drove her home.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Swell. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She’s upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here
till you got home.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Standing guard over the old castle,
are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Here. It looks like you need a
refill.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Is anything wrong? You look a little
shaken up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. No - I’m just - I’m just a little worried
about my future. I’m a little upset about my future.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Come on. Let’s have a nightcap
together.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you very much, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Ben - how old are you now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Twenty. I’ll be twenty-one next week.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: That’s a hell of a good age to be.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I wish I was that age again. Because,
Ben -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: You’ll never be young again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Ben, can I say something to you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: How long have we known each other
now?</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: How long have you and I known each
other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I’ve watched you grow up, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: In many ways I feel as though you were
my own son.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: So I hope you won’t mind my giving you
a friendly piece of advice.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d like to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Ben - I think - I think you ought to
be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Sow a few wild oats. Take things as
they come. Have a good time with the girls and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t get up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I was just telling Ben here he ought
to sow a few wild oats. Have a good time while he can. You think that’s
sound advice?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: You have yourself a few flings this
summer. I bet you’re quite a ladies’ man.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: What? You look like the kind of guy
that has to fight them off. Doesn’t he look to you like the kind of guy
who has to fight them off?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes, he does.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Oh say - Elaine gets down from
Berkeley on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Ben - I want you to give her a
call.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you for taking me home.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’ll see you soon, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen - your
attention, please - for this after- noon’s feature attraction.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Hey, over there – I mean you! Your
attention please!</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Are you ready in there, feature
attraction?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Could I speak to you for a second,
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: - what was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. arnold</strong>: Feature attraction.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Right. Hey - I’m glad to see you’re
paying attention. A feature attraction that will be one of the most
astounding events ever to take place in this particular backyard.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Now I’m going to ask for a big round
of applause to bring this boy out here - wait a minute - let me amend
that - to bring this young man out here - because today he is
twenty-one-years- old -</p>
<p><strong>mr. arnold</strong>: Let’s get on with the show!</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Just hang on a minute because I have a
few words to say -</p>
<p><strong>mr. arnold</strong>: You always do.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Dad - could we just talk about this for
a second?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and
gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather
extraordinary things at one of our nation’s leading seats of learning
-</p>
<p><strong>mr. arnold</strong>: Bring him out!</p>
<p><strong>peter and louise</strong>: On with the show! On with the
show!</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: I can’t hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: I’d like to discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: This boy - I’m sorry - this young man
- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halping- ham Award
Scholar - but before he does -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: - before he does - You’re
disappointing them, Ben. You’re disappointing them.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Dad - can you listen -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: I’ll give you ten seconds. He is going
to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a
pretty exciting birthday present - and it better work or I’m out over
two hundred bucks - so let’s hear it for -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: - Benjamin Braddock!</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Folks - this remarkable young man is
going to perform for you some spectacular and amazing feats of daring in
water that is over six feet deep -</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: the rythmic PUMPING of air, obliterating the
SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and
chattering noiselessly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson - I don’t quite know how to put
this -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - I was thinking about that time after the
party -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - and I was wondering if I could buy you a
drink or something -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Uh - The Taft Hotel.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Did you get a room?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. Now I know it’s pretty late and if you’d
rather -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Give me an hour.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: I’ll be there in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Can I help you, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What? Oh - no - I’m just -</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Are you here for an affair, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: The Singleman party, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - yes. The Singleman party.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: It’s in the main ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ahh - thank you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: You must be one of the Porters.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - actually I’m not -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: I’d like you to know my sister, Miss
DeWitte -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you do, Miss DeWitte?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: - and my husband, Mr. Singleman
-</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - sorry -</p>
<p><strong>jeffrey singleman</strong>: Fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: That’s Jeffrey, of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mr. singleman</strong>: I didn’t get your name, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Benjamin Braddock, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: Braddock - Braddock?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes, but I’m afraid -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: I’ll find your table in a moment.
Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - actually I’m just looking for a
friend.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not with your party - I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: Hey - I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. singleman</strong>: Angela - please!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Hello, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Hello. Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: May I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Very well. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: May I have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A drink? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He didn’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Waiter!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I will have a martini.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You don’t have to be so nervous, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it’s
- it’s pretty hard to be suave when you’re -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Did you get us a room?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Have you gotten us a room yet?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I haven’t. No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you want to?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I don’t. I mean I could. Or we could
just talk.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you want me to get it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You? Oh no. No. I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you want to get it now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Why don’t you get it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t I get it? Well - I will then. If
you’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A room. I’d like a room, please.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: A single room or a double room?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A single. Just for myself, please.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Will you sign the register, please?</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Is anything wrong, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What? No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Do you have any luggage, Mister –
Gladstone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Where is your luggage?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well it’s in the car. It’s out in the car.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Very good, sir. I’ll have a porter bring
it in.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean I’d - I’d rather not go to the trouble
of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it my- self.
If that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: I’ll have a porter show you the
room.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Well actually, I’d just as soon find it
myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage
it myself.</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Whatever you say, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Mrs. Robinson?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: It’s Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Benjamin Braddock.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin – where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Can you look through the glass.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Can you see me now?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes, I can.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I got a single room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But there’s one thing. The desk clerk seemed to
be a little bit suspicious. I mean - I don’t know what their policy is -
but -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well - do you want to go up
first?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes - I think that would be good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’ll be up in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - goodbye then -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Isn’t there something you want to
tell me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: To tell you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I want you to know how much I appreciate
this - really -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: The number.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: The room number, Benjamin. I think
you ought to tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh? You’re absolutely right. Absolutely. It’s
512.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re welcome. Well - I’ll see you later,
Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I say I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The toothbrush. I got it all right.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. Well - goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Goodnight, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’ll get undressed now. Is that all
right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure. Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here?
I mean - I don’t know what you want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Why don’t you watch?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - sure. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Will you bring me a hanger?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: A hanger.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - yes. Wood?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wood or wire? They have both.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Either one will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Will you help me with this,
please?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Would this be easier for you in the
dark?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson - I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is all terribly wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin - do you find me
undesirable?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think - I think you’re
the most attractive of all my parents’ friends. I just don’t think we
could possibly –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Are you afraid of me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - but look - maybe we could do something
else together, Mrs. Robinson - would you like to go to a movie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, is this your first
time?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is this - what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: It is, isn’t it? It is your first
time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That’s a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That’s really a
laugh. Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You can admit that, can’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: It’s nothing to be ashamed of -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: On your first time -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who said it was my first time.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That you’re afraid -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: - of bring - inadequate - I mean just
because you happen to be inadequate in one way -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: teenagers YELLING and swimming in nearby
pools; a radio PLAYING rock and roll; a television set TUNED to a ball
game.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock’s voice</strong>: Ben - what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Well - I would say that I’m just
drifting.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - here - in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - it’s very comfortable - just to drift
here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Have you thought about graduate
school?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Would you mind telling me then - what
were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that
hard work?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Now listen, Ben. I think it’s a very
good thing that a young man - after he’s done some very good work -
should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and
drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would
want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to
think about getting off his ass.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: The Robinson’s are here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Hi, Ben. What are you doing with
yourself these days?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - not too much. Taking it easy.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: That’s what I’d do if I could. Nothing
wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine’s coming down from Berkeley soon. I
want you to call her up this time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Because I just think you two would hit
it off real well together.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Say hello to Mrs. Robinson,
Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Hello, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Can I talk to you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Benjamin? I’m going to ask you
something but you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Well I’m going to ask you what you do
when you go off at night.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When I go off?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: You don’t have to tell me if you
don’t want.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I do. I want to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I drive around.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Well you don’t drive around from
midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Then what do you do? Do you meet
someone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Meet someone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why did you say that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Well this is your business, Benjamin.
If you -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No wait. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t meet anyone, mother, but why did you
say that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Benjamin, I’m not going to pry into
your affairs, but I’d rather you didn’t say anything at all than be
dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, wait.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You think I’m being dishonest?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well why do you - why do you think that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Because I know you don’t drive around
for twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Well, I don’t. Shall I tell you what I
do?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Not if you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: But I don’t want you to make up
something.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not. But I’m - I’m not very proud of what I
do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and
go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I
won’t have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to
drive home after -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Goodnight, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You believe me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But I want you to. Please. Please will you
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute. Sit down a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you please sit down a minute.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you leave that shoe on for a minute.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now - do you think we could say a few words to
each other first this time?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good. I mean are we dead or something?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well I just don’t think we have much
to say to each other.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All we ever do is come up here and throw off
the clothes and leap into bed together.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Are you tired of it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not. No. But do you think we could liven it
up with a few words now and then?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well what do you want to talk
about?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Anything. Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you want to tell me about some of
your college experiences?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson. If that’s the best we can do
let’s just get the god- damn clothes off and –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing.
We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: How about art.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Art. That’s a good subject. You start it
off.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You start it off. I don’t know
anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Go ahead then.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Art. Well what do you want to know about
it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are you interested more in modern art or more
in classical art.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Neither.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re not interested in art?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then why do you want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Can I take off my clothes now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you
did today.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you really want me to?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I got up.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you want to hear it or not?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a
little originality.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I got up. I ate breakfast and went
shopping. During the after- noon I read a novel.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What novel did you read.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Then I fixed supper for my husband
and waited until -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There’s something
we could have a conversation about.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Him?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean everything. I don’t know anything about
how you - how you work this. I don’t know how you get out of the house
at night. I don’t know the risk involved.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: There isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There’s no risk?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you get out of the house?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I walk out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You walk right out the door.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you say to him?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: He’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Always?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, this isn’t a very
interesting topic.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won’t
wake up sometime and follow you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Because he takes sleeping pills. He
takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But what about the noise from the car. What if
-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: The driveway’s on my side of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re talking, Mrs. Robinson. We’re
talking.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Calm down, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now let’s keep going here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Can I undress and talk at the same
time?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now. You say the driveway’s on your side of the
house. So I guess you don’t sleep in the same room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: We don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So you don’t - I mean I don’t like to seem like
I’m prying but I guess you don’t sleep together or anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well how long has this been going on.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: About five years.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You have not slept with your husband for five
years?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Now and then. He geats drunk a few
times a year.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How many times a year.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: On New Year’s Eve. Sometimes on his
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Man, is this interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So you don’t love him. You wouldn’t say you
-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: We’ve talked enough, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute. So you wouldn’t say you loved
him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But you don’t hate him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No, Benjamin. I don’t hate him.
Unhook my blouse.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well how do you feel about him, then?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well that’s kind of a bad situation then, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean it doesn’t sound like it could be much
worse. If you hated him at least you’d hate him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well you loved him once, I assume. When you
first knew him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I never did, Benjamin. Now let’s
-</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, wait a minute. You married him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: See if you can guess.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Think real hard, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I can’t see why you did, unless …you didn’t
have to marry him or anything, did you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t tell Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no. You had to marry him because you got
pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Are you shocked?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as
the kind of people who…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: All right. Now let’s get to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it
happen?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean do you feel like telling me what were
the circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Was he a law student at the time?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And you were a student also.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: At college.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What was your major?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Why are you asking me all this?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I’m interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what
was your major subject at college?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Art.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Art?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But I thought you - I guess you kind of lost
interest in it over the years then.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well how did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: How do you think.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean did he take you up to his room with him?
Did you go to a hotel?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, what does it possibly
matter?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m curious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: We’d go to his car.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no. In the car you did it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t think we were the first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What kind of car was it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you remember the make of the car?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Really. I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: It was a Ford, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That’s
great!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: So old Elaine Robinson got started in a
Ford.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t talk about Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t talk about Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Because I don’t want you to.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I wish you’d tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: There’s nothing to tell.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a
sudden?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I guess I’ll have to ask her out on a
date and find out what’s –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, don’t you ever take that
girl out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well look. I have no intention of taking her
out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was just kidding around.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But why shouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I have my reasons.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then let’s hear them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because
I think I know what they are.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not good enough for her to associate with,
am I? I’m not good enough to even talk about her, am I?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Let’s drop it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’re not dropping it. Now that’s the reason,
isn’t it? I’m a dirty degenerate, aren’t I? I’m not fit to -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m good enough for you but I’m too slimy to
associate with your daughter. That’s it, isn’t it? ISN’T IT?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You go to hell. You go straight to hell,
Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I’m proud of myself? Do you think I’m proud
of this?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You’re not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time
with a broken- down alcoholic!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: And if you think I come here for any reason
besides pure boredom, then you’re all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because - Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest,
most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want
but I’m getting the hell out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re goddamn right I am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That’s how you feel about me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That I’m a sick and disgusting
person.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now don’t start this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t start acting hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Don’t you expect me to be a little
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I’m
not good enough for your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Did I say that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course you did.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin, I want to apologize to you
if that’s the impression you got.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn’t good
enough for your daughter. Now you say you’re sorry I got that
impression.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I didn’t mean it. I don’t think you’d
be right for each other. But I would never say you weren’t as good a
person as she is.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Of course I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Well it’s pretty obvious you don’t
want me around any more.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well look - I was kind of upset there. I’m
sorry I said those things.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: If that’s how you feel -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: That’s all right. I think I can
understand why I’m disgusting to you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no. Look - I like you. I wouldn’t keep
coming here if I didn’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: But if it’s sickening for you -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it.
It’s the one thing I have to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: You don’t have to say that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well I wouldn’t. I would never say it if it
wasn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: May I stay then?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. Please. I want you to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well don’t thank me, because I want you to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: But you won’t ever take out Elaine,
will you? I want you to promise me that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It
never occured to me to take her out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Then give me your word you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This is absurd.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Promise me, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right, for christ’s sake. I promise I will
never take out Elaine Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Thank you. Benjamin -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s not talk about it. Let’s not talk at
all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Elaine’s back from school. I think it
might be a nice gesture if you asked her out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Don’t you think that she’s a terribly
attractive girl? Because I think she’s one of the prettiest girls I’ve
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: It’s pretty embarrassing. I really
don’t know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It’s ackward and strained for me
every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Next time he suggests it, I’ll tell him I have
no intention of ever calling her up in my life.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: I guess she’s not good enough for you,
is that it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - Elaine Robinson and I do not get
along.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: How do you know? You haven’t seen her
since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are
just too valuable.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That has nothing to do with it -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: I guess I’ll just tell Mr. Robinson
that you’re just too busy every evening - doing God knows what -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Don’t go on like this. Now if
Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: - then I’ll simply invite all the
Robinsons’ over for dinner on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll go call Elaine now.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Ding dong of the Robinson door chimes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Well, Braddock - it’s about time you
got around to this. Come on in. I’m afraid the young lady isn’t quite
ready yet -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: What would you say to a short one?
Bourbon still your drink?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I’ll see if she’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>ben mr. robinson’s voice</strong>: Now listen – this was not
my idea. It was my father’s Hey – there she is. Miss idea. America –
that’s who it is. It’s definitely Miss America.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Benjamin – I thought I made ELAINE’S
VOICE myself perfectly clear about Daddy - can you fix this? this. The
clasp is broken I think.</p>
<p><strong>ben mr. robinson’s voice</strong>: I’ll do it - I’ll do it.
Look, we’ll go out to dinner and have a drink and I’ll ELAINE’S VOICE
bring her back. Because it Is Ben here? was either that or a dinner
party for the two families. MR. ROBINSON’S VOICE And I’m afriad I

with your mother. don’t mind. I have no intention of ever taking your
precious daughter out again in her life. So don’t get upset about
it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: But I am. I’m extremely upset about
it, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson’s voice</strong>: Well - I want you to keep your
wits about you tonight. You never know what tricks Ben picked up back
there in the East.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’re living at home now. Is that
right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you know what you’re going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you going to graduate school?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you always drive like this?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you want some dinner?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’d love some.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Bring a menu.</p>
<p><strong>waiter #2</strong>: Dinner for two, sir?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. Just for her.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Aren’t you eating?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If it’s all right with you, I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ve changed my mind. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t you watch the show?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - do you dislike me for some
reason?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - why should I?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re missing a great effect here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How do you like that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Could you do it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Will you take me home now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m sorry I took you in there.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I think I’d better go home now please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But, Elaine -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Where is the car?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just want to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But could I just tell you this one thing?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: This whole idea - this date and everything. It
was my parents’ idea. They forced me into it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh - that’s very nice of you to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. What I mean is - that’s why I’ve been
acting this way. I’m not like this. I hate myself like this.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen - could you stop crying, please?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But could you try?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Not here. Not here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve had this feeling - ever since I’ve
graduated - this - kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the
time. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s like I’ve been playing some kind of - game
- but the rules don’t make any sense to me -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - they’re being made up by all the wrong people
- no - I mean no one makes them up, they seem to have made themselves
up.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Say - I wonder if I could request you to turn
that down a little?</p>
<p><strong>sounds</strong>: Cars GUNNING their ENGINES; horns HONKING;
radios PLAYING; waitresses YELLING orders; customers YELLING at
waitresses; kids LAUGHING and TALKING from car to car; MOTORCYCLES
driving in and out, TRAFFIC.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well - maybe I’d better go in.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Would you like to come in? I could make some
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I mean - I wouldn’t want to wake anyone
up.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: We won’t. Let’s go inside.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - I was just thinking - look - it’s still
early - we could do something - go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m trying to think of where there’s a place to
have a drink around here.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Isn’t there one in the Taft Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What is the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Nothing. I’m just wondering if they have a bar
or not. I mean let’s go see. Let’s go see if they do or not.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen, Elaine - it seems to me that there
isn’t a bar in here. I mean - as far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Of course there is. Look - The Veranda Room
- right there.</p>
<p><strong>car parker</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Hello, how are you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>room clerk</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Hi, Mr. Gladstone. How are you this
evening?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Let’s get out of here, Elaine. Let’s go
somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - do they know you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>voice #3</strong>: Good evening, sir.</p>
<p><strong>voice #4</strong>: Mr. Gladstone - how are you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come on, Elaine. We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Ben - what’s happening? Who is
Mr. Gladstone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know. They must think I look like this
guy Gladstone.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Car STARTING noisily.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - I like you. I like you so much. Do you
believe that?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’re the first - you’re the first thing for
so long that I’ve liked. The first person I could stand to be with.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I mean my whole life is such a waste. It’s just
nothing. I’m sorry. I’ll take you home now.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - are having an affair with
someone?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry. That is not my business.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It just happened. It was just this thing that
happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Was she married or something?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: With a family?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. She had a husband and a son.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Did they ever find out?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: And it’s all over now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Can we do something tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: During the day? We’ll go for a drive or
something.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You sure you really want to?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because I wouldn’t want you to do it unless you
really wanted to!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - I really do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Drive down the block.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson - I have a date with Elaine.
We’re going for a drive.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Do exactly what I say.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now it seems to me -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Listen to me very carefully,
Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is
that clear?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I can makes things quite
unpleasant.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: In order to keep Elaine away from you
- I am prepared to tell her everything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Then you’d better start believing
me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mrs. Robinson, don’t wreck it. I’m asking you
please not to wreck it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Go home now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I just don’t believe you would do that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Try me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s voice</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m coming up.</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s voice</strong>: I’m not dressed yet.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - I said I wasn’t dressed -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ve got to go over the back fence and I’ll
meet you on the corner.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hurry up. Put your shoes on.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why aren’t you ready?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Because I want to know what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: There isn’t time!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - I have to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That woman -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: That woman. The older woman.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You mean the one who -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes. The married woman - it wasn’t just some
woman -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Please - will somebody tell me -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh - no.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh my God -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - don’t cry -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Goodbye, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Say that again.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going to marry Elaine Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Well - well - well -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Ben says he and Elaine are getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: That what he says. Right?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m going up to Berkeley today.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Oh, Ben - this is so - exciting -</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Come on, let’s call the Robinsons.
We’ve got something to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. I think you’ll want to wait on that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: They don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: Well - when did you decide all
this?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: About an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. She doesn’t know about it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: She doesn’t know that you’re coming up
to Berkeley?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. Actually - she doesn’t know about us
getting married yet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: When did you two talk this over?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. braddock</strong>: Ben - this whole idea sounds pretty
half-baked.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No - it’s not. It’s completely baked. It’s a
decision I’ve made.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. braddock</strong>: But what makes you think she wants to
marry you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: She doesn’t. To be perfectly honest, she
doesn’t like me.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Dear Elaine - I am now visiting
Berkeley, after growing somewhat weary of family life. I have been
meaning to stop by and pay my respects but am not entirely certain just
how you feel about seeing me after the incident involving myself and
your mother. It was certainly a serious mistake on my part but not
serious enough. I hope –</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. G. L. Robinson take great
pleasure in announcing the wedding of their daughter…</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Honey - I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s voice</strong>: Hi - Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Where are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s voice</strong>: Oh, they’re having a wonderful time
- spending the day at Mother’s - she’s teaching them to…</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Dear Mom and Dad. You may have wondered
why Elaine and I haven’t written in such a long time, but the postal
sytem here in Greenland isn’t the most efficient. Life among these
wonderful natives…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Do you, Benjamin Braddock take this
woman, Mrs. Robinson, for your Mother-in-law, to love, cherish and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: Benjamin - you and Elaine
have made such a wonderful marriage. I often laugh when I remember those
nights at the Taft.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Yes - how long ago that all seems.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson’s voice</strong>: I’ll never forget how peeved
I was when I first…</p>
<p><strong>lady receptionist no. 1</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>lady receptionist no. 1</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine Robinson. Does she live here?</p>
<p><strong>lady receptionist no. 1</strong>: Three-oh-eight. Shall I
call her for you?</p>
<p><strong>153 int. rooming house hall and stairs - night - ben
and</strong>: MR. McCLEERY</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I said - not exactly - no.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - I’m just sort of traveling through.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ahhh.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’m not up too much, actually, I’m just
visiting. I mean - I’ve always wanted to see Berkeley.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - no sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine. Hey - what a surprise. Say - I thought
I remembered that you were going to school up here - well - we’ll have
to get together sometime - I’ll be up here myself for a little
while.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - it certainly has been nice - I think I’m late
- yes, I am -</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: Footsteps running, a door opening and
closing, footsteps running upstairs, a door opening and slamming.</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: he moves past people Excuse me - I’m
sorry - I wonder if I could get by - excuse me -</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: Well - how about this for a
coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I was wondering where you were headed.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m meeting someone.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Ah. Where?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where are you meeting this person?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: At the Zoo.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do
they?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ve never been to it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh. Well, I haven’t either. I might just ride
out there with you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is that him over there?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where did he say he was going to meet you?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I thought he said by the monkey house.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - I would like to know what you’re
doing here.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here? In Berkelely?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter
Street - and I’ve been getting to some classes -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: But you’re not enrolled.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. I just sit in. They don’t seem to mind.
They’ve been very congenial about it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - you’re - I don’t know what to say
- you’re –</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Maybe we could get together some time and talk
about it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: - really incredible -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ve got a real feeling that this is the
fellow.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Elaine!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: He certainly is a good walker.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Am I late? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We thought you said by the monkey house.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: This is Benjamin Braddock. Carl Smith.
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Glad to meet you, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Great meeting you, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Swell seeing you. Have a good time.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I want to ask you a question.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No. I want to know why you’re here in
Berkeley?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because - I am.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Is it because I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I said I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right then! Yes!</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well, I want you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - I love you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: How could you do that, Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Do you just hate everything? How could you
possibly rape my…</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t understand -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Did you say rape her?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: - how you - how anyone - could do a thing
like that.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Let me go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You’ve got to tell me what she said.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Because it isn’t true.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t feel well.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: She said she was having a drink in the hotel
with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she
was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the
night.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Then you took her upstairs and you raped
her.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - that is not what happened.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Please let me go.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: All right - but listen to me. What happened was
there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home - then we
went upstairs to see your portrait -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t tell me -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - and when we got up in the room she starts
taking her her clothes off - and -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - this is my mother!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: - suddenly there she was without any clothes on
- I mean really naked -</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A KNOCK on the door.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh - hello, Mr. McCleery.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It’s all right, Mr. McCleery.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was just a visitor. But it’s all right
now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - she’s all right. She’s upset and she
screamed. But she’s okay now.</p>
<p><strong>a boy</strong>: Shall I get the cops?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>a boy</strong>: I’ll get the cops.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hey - wait a minute. Now damn it - look.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: See - she’s just having some water. Now there’s
no need for the cops or anything.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mr. McCleery?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’m sorry I screamed.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin, when you came up here, what did
you think was going to happen between us?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - right now I don’t feel like talking
much. I’m sorry about everything but I think I’ll just do this now.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Can I just sit here while you’re
packing?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: If you want.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: My belt.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Don’t you have it on?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No. I have two. The other one is the one I’m
looking for. What’s this? It’s from my grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: The marble?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The belt I’m looking for was from my
grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: What are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Are you going home?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well - where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - you’re going to have to stop asking me
that.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t want you to leave tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t want you to go anywhere until you
have a definite plan.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But Elaine -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Will you kiss me!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You won’t?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But you might.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I might.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is that so? You might marry me?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How about tomorrow? I don’t mean to be pushy
but -</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know what’s
happening.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You mean you’re confused?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - look - don’t be confused. We’re getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I don’t see how we can.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We just can.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I have to go back now.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - are you serious about this?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You really will?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well - let’s get together sometime.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: FOOTSTEPS descending stairs. Someone
WHISTLING. The FOOTSTEPS and WHISTLING get nearer and stop.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We could go down and get our blood tests
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Or this afternoon. It’s a good day for it.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Benjamin - I haven’t even said I’ll marry
you yet.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: We’ll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to
have mine with me. Where’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I just don’t think it would work.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: I just don’t think it would…</p>
<p><strong>192- omitted</strong>: 193</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Tomorrow then - can we get our blood tests
tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Why don’t you just drag me off if you want
to marry me so much?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why don’t I just drag you off? All right - I
will. Right after we get the blood tests.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well - I have to see Carl first.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Carl who?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Carl who?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Carl Smith. He’s a medical student. We’ve
known him for years.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Who - that guy at the Zoo?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Why do you have to see him?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Well – I said I might marry him.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You WHAT?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees?
He didn’t get down on his knees, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Well, what did he say? I’m curious.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: He said he thought we’d make a pretty good
team.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Oh no. He said that.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Shhhh.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where did he do it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’d like to know where it happened?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It wasn’t in his car, was it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Are we getting married tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The day after tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Maybe we are and maybe we aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Do you want - do you want to try and
tell me why you did it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mr. Robinson?</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Do you have a special grudge against
me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, it’s not –</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Is there something I’ve said that’s
caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you
despise?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It was nothing to do with you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do
with me.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Now look - please -</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Ben, I think we’re two civilized human
beings. Do you think it’s necessary to threaten each other?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am not threatening you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Do you want to unclench your fists,
please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I’ve been here quite
a while.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I am trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not
resent you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: You don’t respect me terribly much
either, do you?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Well, I don’t think we have a whole
lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the
consequences of what you’ve done. I do think you should know that my
wife and I are getting a divorce soon.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: It shouldn’t make any difference what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: That’s quite a statement.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen to me. We got - we got into bed with
each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might - we
might just as well have been shaking hands.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Shaking hands. Well, that’s not saying
much for my wife, is it?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You miss the point.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Don’t shout at me, Ben.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: The point is - I don’t love your wife. I love
your daughter, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Well - I’m sure you think you do, Ben,
but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you’d get
over that as quickly as you -</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I think I’ve talked about this enough.
I don’t know how far I can go, Ben. I don’t know if I can prosecute or
not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what’s happened I think
maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I
have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to
insure…</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: Stay away from me, Ben!</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I don’t want to mince words with you.
As far as Elaine’s concerned you’re to get her out of your filthy mind
right now. Is that perfectly clear ro you? That’s all, Ben. You’ll
pardon me if I don’t shake hands with you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I think you are filth.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: I think you are scum.</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson</strong>: You are a degenerate!</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Mr. McCleery - do you have some change? I need
to use the phone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Look - I’ll give you ten dollars for a dime -
I’ll give you twenty - for God’s sake, will you let me use that
phone?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Could I make one phone call first?</p>
<p><strong>202- omitted</strong>: 209</p>
<p><strong>lady receptionist #2</strong>: Elaine Robinson has left the
school.</p>
<p><strong>lady receptionist #2</strong>: Her roommate is coming down
with a note for you.</p>
<p><strong>elaine’s voice</strong>: Dear Benjamin - I promise you some-
say I will write a long letter about everything but right now I can’t
thank and all I can say to you is please forgive me because I know what
I’m doing is the best thing for you. My father is so upset you’ve got to
understand. I love you, but it would never work out.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine - Elaine -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Hello, Benjamin.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Hello. Get me the police, please.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Where is Elaine?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’ll be with you in a moment,
Benjamin. Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We
have a burgler here. Just a second. I’ll ask him. Are you armed? No - I
don’t believe he is. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What have you done to her?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I think we have everything quite
under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you
go?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You can’t stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson. I’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I’m sorry we won’t be able to invite
you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed
-</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: What the hell have you done?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: Ahh. I don’t think you’ll have time
for that drink after all.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: I’ll find her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. robinson</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Wedding! God Damn it - wedding!</p>
<p><strong>mr. robinson’s voice</strong>: Carl - I think you and Elaine
will make a good team.</p>
<p><strong>carl’s voice</strong>: Your father’s right, Elaine. You and I
will make a darned good team.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: We have two Carl Smiths. Is it Carl
with a “C” or a “K”?</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: The Karl Smith with a “K” teaches
History of Advertising -</p>
<p><strong>ben’s voice</strong>: And the other?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: The one with the “C”, Carl Smith
Junior, is in our medical school. He lives at Gamma Delta Tau.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Say - fellows -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do any of you fellows know where Carl Smith
is?</p>
<p><strong>frat brother #1</strong>: He took off in the middle of the
night to get married.</p>
<p><strong>frat brother #2</strong>: Proabaly one step ahead of the
shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Do you happen to know where he’s getting
married? I’m supposed to be there.</p>
<p><strong>frat brother #2</strong>: Why don’t you ask Carter?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Would you happen to know where I might find
him?</p>
<p><strong>frat brother #2</strong>: He’s probably still in the sack.
He’s always in the sack.</p>
<p><strong>frat brother #3</strong>: Or in the can.</p>
<p><strong>man at sink</strong>: Hey, Carter - where’s the Make Out King
getting married?</p>
<p><strong>carter’s voice</strong>: Santa Barbara.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: You don’t happen to know exactly where the Make
Out King is getting married, do you? I’m supposed to be there.</p>
<p><strong>carter’s voice</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe at his old man’s
home.</p>
<p><strong>man at sink</strong>: You going to the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man at sink</strong>: Give the bride a message for me. Tell
her to act surprised.</p>

<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: 657-2036</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Hello - who is this?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: This is Dr. Smith’s answering
service.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Is the doctor anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Well - you see - the doctor is at his
son’s wedding, but I’m sure it’s over by now. He should be checking in
any moment -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith’s brother -
Reverend Smith - and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got
in - from - Portland - and I’ve forgotten what church - you see?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh. Well - I’m not sure - but you
might try the First Presbyterian. That’s on Allan Street.</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I certainly hope you -</p>
<p><strong>ben</strong>: Allan Street. Where is it?</p>
