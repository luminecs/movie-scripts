<p><strong>male voice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: ….never mind. I’ll replace these later.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: You ought to eat.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I started your dinner for you.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Well it’s fixed, so you’ll have to eat it.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: No, your going to eat it, or it will go to
waste.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: ….in the constant striving for
perfection in the AIA.PB848’s which have been built this year. Five
felons have been caught fleeing rehabilitation center dd2. All five have
been undergoing treatment for drug offenses, two of the felons were
products of the sex act, the other three….</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: Two of the felons are products of the
sex act, the other three are from reproduction clinic nineteen. The
quintet escaped from compound 545 and were all subsequently destroyed.
Reports indicate….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What’s this? Why did you change it?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: You’ve seen enough.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: You know I don’t feel well.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Eat your dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mannequin one</strong>: ….and then my request for new arms
and legs finally came through.</p>
<p><strong>mannequin two</strong>: Well that’s great then.</p>
<p><strong>mannequin one</strong>: No. It’s terrible. I ordered two arms
and a new leg, and they sent me two legs and a new arm.</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: THX is expressionless.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: That was very funny.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: What?</p>

two more. Help is on the…</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Concourse 5…..Cross 3…..Monitor
concourse 5…..3417 are you there? Relate….relate…..</p>
<p><strong>close angle</strong>: LUH reaches for a container of yellow
pills, she thinks for a moment, then returns the pills to the container.
On the monitors there is much confusion in the destroyed passageway.
People move along the corridor to get a better look at the accident. LUH
pushes a button and a tape activates.</p>
<p><strong>tape voice</strong>: Do not enter this area without consuming
j23. This is a traumatic area. Do not enter this area without….</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Radiation suppress. Seal chamber 5G,
seal chamber 5G. Exterminate occupant.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Fire in sub-station 35k, command 13, we’ve got
73 men down here…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are a true believer, blessings of State,
blessings of the masses Thou art a subject of….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stay calm, correct procedure is essential. Do
not fail to remove auxiliary command circuit before evacuation. Vacuum
detail and suppression units for your area have been notified and are on
their Way.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: My time is yours, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Very good, proceed.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Well…. I slipped on a T5 transfer this morning.
It’s never happened before.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: ….going well. How could I be so wrong. SCO 1202
cross wired a 904. He’s been receiving extra credit. He offered me
some.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I did not accept any. I… I wanted… to. But I
didn’t. You know I didn’t. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: My mate has been acting very strange. I can’t
explain it…..but. I haven’t been feeling very well myself. I don’t know,
maybe it’s me. I needed an SP9 last night. I feel as if something odd
were happening to me. Something….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I can’t understand. The sedatives….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: ….I’m taking SP5, but it doesn’t seem strong
enough. I have a hard time concentrating. Please forgive me, I slipped
on….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are a true believer. Blessings of the
state, blessings of the masses. Thou art a subject of the divine.
Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be
thankful we have an occupation to fill. Work hard; increase production;
prevent accidents, and be happy.</p>
<p><strong>scheduling office</strong>: THX is in a large hall, crossing
over to a bank of small boxes along the wall. He attempts to open one of
the boxes with a plastic badge from his lapel, and struggles for a
moment before finally getting it open. He pushes some buttons inside the
box, then closes it. He is very tired; almost unable to cope with the
trivia of daily life.</p>
<p><strong>med angle</strong>: THX turns around to leave and is
confronted by LUH, who has been standing directly behind him. She is
holding a punch card.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What do you want?……</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What did you get?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I have to see SEN. I’ve just been given a shift
change.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: He wants me to come to his quarters.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: A shift change should come through the
scheduling office.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I have to… he’s a G-34</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: You don’t have to… I don’t trust him. You ought
to file a report.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: No, don’t make trouble. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Then why did you bring it up?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I didn’t. You asked me about the card. You’re
going to get us into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Don’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: ….to stimulate the arithmetical and logical
processes as an extention of the 5141. Never before have we been so
contented, never before has life been so satisfying… there is a jump in
the man’s movement - a reminder that he is only a hologram. …so
satisfying. A referendum of bliss, a fabrication of gratification
sustained by the benevolence of authority…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: a referendum of bliss, a fabrication of
gratification sustained by the benevolence of authority…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …the inadequacies of the human</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: LUH?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …an infinite translate in mathematics of
tolerance and charity among artificial memory devices is ultimately
binary. Stimulating…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: LUH? is that you?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: LUH?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: sealed personal effects: 3 styrenes; an
occupational syntax; a red magna base - old style; a box of neons; a
variation; 23 hunter portapods.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: It’s you, come in, come in…you know, this is
really odd. I was just thinking about you. What in the world are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: For the moment, I thought you were one of the
others. You look much… different - in person.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Sit down, why don’t you?…. Anyway… I must
apologize for all this chaos. They materialized this morning and it’s
been going on all day. Well, it’s cross I have to bear - the roommate
was destroyed, you know.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: No…I guess you wouldn’t. Terrible
inconvenience. I could never understand why it all must be created and
filed if it’s going to be destroyed anyway. When I pass on, I certainly
don’t want anyone going through my things…. It’s a strange life. I
really cannot understand why you don’t sit down.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: You never answered my question.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Well, at least you’re sitting down… You must
excuse my going on like that…. with ONA gone I feel as if I have no one
to talk to. You’re perspiring, aren’t you? My goodness, it’s not very
hot in here. Are you sick?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I’m sure it’s warmer in her than outside,
though. I haven’t been out yet, but it usually is…the control is
fouled…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Where is LUH?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Count concluded.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You must keep this.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: They really smell. It’s disgusting. Did you
notice it?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Why did you have LUH come here?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Why are you so concerned?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I want you for my roommate.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Where’s LUH?</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: It will be good for both of us. I’ve got it all
arranged.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I don’t understand. Living….selection is
computed. You can’t… What have you done to LUH? She was here..</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: We had a long talk and she agreed that it would
be a good idea for you to switch. She felt that you had not been
accurately mated to her in the first place… You’re upsetting yourself.
Would you like something?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: You’re in violation.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Don’t say that. You look… You’re not well.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I know what you’re thinking… Program shifting
isn’t that major a crime is it? LUH is a problem for you. I’ve watched
her during work. She’s been acting very strange.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I won’t have another mate like ONA. You rate
very high in sanitation. I’ve checked. In fact, I am surprised that you
were ever matched with LUH. Her ratings are very erratic - you know what
I mean. We’ll be happy.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I don’t feel well.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: ….with me? What am I to her or she to me?
Nothing. She’s an ordinary roommate. I..I share…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: …rooms with her. Our relationship is normal,
conforming. We share nothing but space. What is she doing to…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: …to me. I think I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You are a true believer. Blessings of the
state. Blessings of the masses. Thou art a subject of the divine.
Created in the image of man, by man, for man. Let us be thankful we have
commerce. Buy more. Buy more now. Buy more and be happy.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Idiot machine! Someone ought to fix this
machine!</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: LUH?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I need help.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Nothing. I was looking for my tenser. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If you have a problem….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Violation…violation…You’re bouncing
in…violation..</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I’ve never been under the table before.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Look,dirt!</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: That’s not dirt…Can’t be dirt.. Dirt is a
violation.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Looks like dirt.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Look, food!</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: That’s not food. Can’t be food.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Looks like food.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Tastes like food.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Produced to be consumed!</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Hey! Wait a minute. Not all of it. I’m
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: The pain, no…the pain, I can’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Why did you do it? It’s wrong…. we’re wrong.
We’re felons now.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Now…now, I’m sorry…don’t - don’t….please. It’s
just… I was happy. Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren’t
satisfied with me.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: What?…Oh, no, THX. That’s not true. Not
satisfied? THX, I need you so much.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I was so scared…I didn’t know what would happen
with you…once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will
be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: But it’s so hopeless…you’re so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I said what time is it? How long was I out?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: It’s 3+27 hundred</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Three! I’m going to be late for my shift.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: No! Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: They’ll come for me right away if I’m not
there. I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Don’t take anything.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Promise…please don’t THX leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What are you doing here? Is anything wrong?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: No….I though I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: You’re not cleared for this precinct. Let’s
cross over first.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: You slipped on a T297 transfer just before
lunch, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the
T297.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What do you think you’re doing? You’re going to
get us arrested.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: But…you…</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I can’t work this way. I need something. I’m
losing control.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I can’t go on like this. I can’t…. I don’t just
sit around and watch people. If I make a mistake, it’s all over. You see
it every day. Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I don’t want to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: ….and it all happened so slowly that most men
failed to realize that anything had happened at all.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: They had never known what all know within,
that to know is not to know, not to know is to be known.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: To remain still is to flow with the will of
OMM. The breath of OMM is infinitely slow, yet he breathes.</p>
<p><strong>voice/congregation</strong>: Before OMM was OMM, after OMM
will be OMM, within OMM is OMM, without OMM is OMM. OMM is one. We are
one, Mass is one, All are one….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I don’t want to lose you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Unity of minds, unity of thought, unity of
occupations, unity of OMM A man. Blessings of the state. Blessings of
the masses, Thou art subjects of the divine.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What am I going to do?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: If you….if you go back on sedation, you won’t
feel the same way about me. You’ll report me for drug evasion.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I’ve got a slip movement to install on my next
shift. I’ll never make it the way I am now.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I couldn’t turn you in, not now. I….I know I
wouldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: You don’t know. You don’t….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: If I take something, you suffer. If I don’t, I
stuff….</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: I know you can do it without sedation, You can,
I know you can.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Then what? It can’t go on forever. You know it
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: We could leave, and live in the
superstructure….</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: ….My series is over, you only have one shift
left, don’t you? We could be gone before our next series started.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: It’s all right now, shhhh it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: Don’t let them separate us.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: AH UGH.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: They know. They’ve been watching us. I can feel
it.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: They don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>luh</strong>: They’re watching us now.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: No one can see us now we’re alone.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …..This is a reminder of the precision which
must be taken at this stage. Three operating cells have already been
destroyed in this shift. Mercicontrol is supervising all operations
during this phase. Prevent accidents, and be happy…..This is a reminder
of…..</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: What are you doing here? You’re not cleared for
this area!</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: You know I have a way with the computers. I can
clear myself for any area…..almost.</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: I’ll report you. It’s….</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: Listen to me….You have no need to distrust me.
We’re going….</p>
<p><strong>thx</strong>: Get out of here, Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I’ve taken care of LUH…..</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: ….I’ve programmed her to level 5450. Her
transfer should go through by the next series. You’re going to need a
new roommate. Everything…..</p>

perversion, unconditional response and transgression. Justice proceed.
Pontifex 606 presiding.</p>
<p><strong>proctor</strong>: Begin.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Mercicontrol respectfully places its
evidence before you.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: 9198,5116, and 1447. These negative
documents are certified by A.N.- O,T.O. and registered at files, tomb
34.</p>
<p><strong>defense</strong>: ….nondrug, nondrug total excuse. 1138 is
unstable condition…not responsible for acts. Nondrug,
asylum….asylum.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Mercicontrol respectfully submits a
5254, immediate destruction, on the basis of an ECO TR-X 314; totally
incurable chemical imbalance with socially deteriorating
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>defense</strong>: Reject, reject. Inefficient unwarranted
destruction. Must be saved…mass is one… can be productive. Name of
economics; cure this soul…malignant cure. There is a heritage of good
and economic efficiency…. net gain.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Insane.</p>
<p><strong>pontifex</strong>: Granted.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Immediate destruction is the only
efficiency. The crimes are of secondary importance. The issue is one of
genetic inferiority. This man is of womb.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: He is the product of an illegal sexual
perversion and should have been destroyed at the moment of conception.
What is in question here is a concept in economic efficiency and
procedure that has allowed these erotics to exist and dilute this great
society.</p>
<p><strong>defense</strong>: Inane…inane…</p>
<p><strong>pontifex</strong>: Rejected.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: The services performed by these erotics
must be automated. If sexual perversion is to be stamped out, the
products of this perversion must…</p>
<p><strong>defense</strong>: Reject…reject…reject… What is the
prosecution doing? This is not a race issue….not here. Remember sanctity
of the individual regardless of race. A nonresponsible act…simple case.
Birthborn citizens are physically compatible with clinic types and must
be consumed, not destroyed. Econ equilibrium status 542 through 691
apply to case. Defendant used, not destroyed. Case rest.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: The perversions committed by this
obsolete race have a definite corrosive effect on our society. If he is
not destroyed, his deviate characteristics will be transmitted to
others. We must not continue to consume these erotics.</p>
<p><strong>pontifex</strong>: Conclude.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: If 1138 is consumed and not destroyed,
this perversion will spread. He must be destroyed. It is the only
logical, efficient, and righteous verdict which can be reached.</p>
<p><strong>proctor</strong>: Concluded.</p>
<p><strong>pontifex</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>pontifex</strong>: OMM be praised. All are One. Praise be to
the masses.</p>
<p><strong>proctor</strong>: 1138 prefix THX stands convicted of index

<p><strong>pto</strong>: Umm…..</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: ….my friend? Your point of view….</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Yes, CAM. That’s it….Your point is well
taken…CAM, but it lacks the balance that a broader and a deeper range of
experience can lend it. When I first arrived here, I saw things as you
do now. I was confused and anxious about my predicament. I longed to
thrash out, to tear down, to destroy and annihilate; to ravage, wreak
havoc, and plunder. Being basically level- headed, however, I realized
that my first goal should be to study this place, where what seemed
blind circumstance had placed me. To follow the train of events and the
ever-changing display of characters that I saw before me - of which I am
of course a part - and to try to discern a pattern within the
confusion.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: I set forth on a program of study which
continues up to this very day and which has afforded me a few glimpses -
if not actual insights - into the nature of the world around us. I never
regretted my youthful passion - quite the contrary, it provided me with
the original spark which has since settled down to a comforting and
enduring glow. But I would caution you that spark - if uncontrolled -
may leap into flames of senseless and disastrous action and consume what
you are endeavoring to conserve.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Listen to the mumblings of an old man and bank
those flames with earnest inquiry and honest observation.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Mumblings is right!</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Do you know how many times we’ve had to listen
to that speech?</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Do you know how many times? ….We’ve had to
listen to that speech? He thinks everyone’s as stupid as he is. You know
what you are? You make me sick. If we all thought like you they could
come in here and…and… do whatever they wanted!</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Sooner or later, you’ll be taken away and
destroyed just like the others.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: In the years to come you will be grateful for
what may now seem like senseless sacrifices. With a passion such as
yours, I don’t think it would be foolish to say that you might see
further and deeper than any of us, right to the heart of Truth
herself!</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: You’re frightened. You’re frightened that at
any moment you’ll be taken away. I know, I’ve felt that way. I couldn’t
eat. I still have trouble. It goes right through, all the time. I know
all right, but I’m better now. I can more or less regulate it. I don’t
think you can understand. …..Terrible, terrible, terrible…. I’ve been
thinking about you.</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: You seem alone. I know. I’ve felt that way. At
work…they told me I was a first class transport regulator. Yes, a tram
pilot. What do you think? Between level 3472 and level 3500, module
center 55 - the big one. A toilet: it’s a toilet. Still, bad air is
better than no air. And the time- tables. Shall I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: What? He’s not very friendly, is he? He said
you were roommates. Was he always so…strange? All he does is save his
food. He eats a little…. very little. He may die. Of course, he may
change. Things do change. I’m the same… Have my plycron…what do you want
me to say? Could we be friends? We could leave together. I have a plan.
See this? I’m making it sharp. We’ll dig..</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: I should have known…You’re with them. You
want….</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Then SLE and RNH, who came between PRT and MNH,
but not before ALF, FRG, and MLK. ALF, FRG, and MLK went before SAM,
RNG, NUR, and KLM. Then RRG, STK, OUN, and FLT. And after them
came….came….</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Four quick felons prepare the bed modules to be
cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Four quick felons prepare the bed modules to be
cleaned. Four: F; Quick: Q; Felons: F…..</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Four….quick….felons prepare. FRK, QUM, FLN,
PSK, and TEL; BGL, MLT, TRN, BRK, and CLS.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Yes, fine! You see, history is not only
important, it can be fun as well.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I can’t believe it! MRK CRK TRK SRK BRK…..</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: You know what I want? Ideas….</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: We’ve just got to be sure it’s the right idea.
But we’ll find it. We’ll know it when we see it. I’ll know it when I see
it. Clear and straight forward and plain as the nose on your face.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Of course it is true that no one has ever
returned once they were taken away, history tells us that, but it is
idle to speculate about the reasons why and absurd to torture oneself
over an idle speculation as NIN is doing. NIN has in fact destroyed
himself many times over with worry.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: That’s what I mean by the wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: I am not going to try to prove the usefulness
of history, it is genuinely too obvious to need proof. We see before us
innumerable scenes, like what we just witnessed, that succeed each other
in endless repetition. Where we see the same faults followed regularly
by the same misfortunes, we may reasonably….</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Don’t you think you could do something about
that? It’s very distracting.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: …we may reasonably think that if we could have
known the first we could have avoided the second. The past should
enlighten us on the future, knowledge of history is no more than an
anticipated experience.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: You’re wrong! They’re going to destroy him!</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I can just barely see him. I think he’s
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: I can’t see him at all. He’s been
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: No, look! Three degrees from the central
azimuth.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: He’s free! Can’t you see: he’s free!</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: I can see him. He’s coming back.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Where? Oh…there he is. He must have been
stopped. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: He was stopped. He was stopped.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: He’s coming back for the rest of us. He can’t
make it alone.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: I wonder how far he went. He’s gathered
invaluable information out there.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: The reckless fool. I’m not responsible.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: What stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: How far did you go? Was it cold?</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: You have nothing to fear. You’re safe
again.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Wait! I’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Ask him about the air. He looks out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Can you speak? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I want to help you. You can help us. Here, take
a biscuit.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: You understand me, can you speak?</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: I think he’s deficient.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I don’t think so. Why don’t you go find
something else to do?</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: Then why doesn’t he speak? Can’t he hear? I
don’t think he knows.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: He took my food. He stole it.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Now, now.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I thought you were through with it!</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be
destroyed. You can work with us. An organized plan of escape must be
devised first. Could you see anything? You want to leave. You’re not
like them. You must have left something, or someone.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: A plan…..an organization. I will see to it that
we all get out of here safely. As soon as you give us a detailed
description of the barrier, we can begin. Information is the key. We
must concentrate on gaining information. You’re with us, I know. I have
a contract..</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: All it says is: you’re with us. We can only
make it together. We must convince the others. Well, later, then.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Without most of us realizing it, a “new
alignment” has been formed… and it is an exciting, healthy development..
this alignment is already a new majority; it will effect the future of
us all for generations to come. We need a new unity, but not a unity
which discourages dissent. We Need dissent.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are
not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences
of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment’s greatest need
is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in
parallel line that never converge. Tomorrow as we focus the new movement
more clearly, we will gain a new unity.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: A nondescript: 364-1399284 The policeman
exits; the freak stands helpless and frightened.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Good Lord!</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: A shelldweller. They live in the outer shell of
the city. Quite unique, there have been two here before. They smell.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Interesting….</p>
<p><strong>dwy</strong>: Get….get away, get, get, get, get away….</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Leave it….for a while.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I think that a leader must, whenever he
possibly can, make the decision for more knowledge rather than less, but
he must also have the wisdom to limit freedom so as to insure freedom.
That is what will keep us strong and give us direction.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Out of a random selection of 150 locations with
150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four
conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages
of the experiment and can be largely discounted.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Not very encouraging.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: On the contrary! It absolutely proves what I
have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no
visible limits. We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of
ignorance and perceive the truth. We must continue the search.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I have always tended to believe that this kind
of knowledge is all well and good in its place, but anything can be
taken too far, and when you’ve got everyone looking off into telescopes
and not tending to business right here, then, I believe, we have gone
too far.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: The sighting of a fixed point beyond our
confines is fundamental to all other problems and issues. It would
instantly determine whether we are, whether this world is, in fact,
moving or standing still.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: I have been thinking seriously recently about
the role we are expected to play as individuals and as a unit within the
broader outlines of society.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Each of us, of course, feels very strongly as
an individual, but I think we could all agree that there is something
here that binds us all together. In this way, we are a whole made up of
different parts. But in the way that each of us relates to all of us
together, all of us together are but a part of society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: Now I come to my point: each one of us can be
in unity with the rest only if there is a leader who can the unifying.
When Posterity judges our actions here it will perhaps see us not as
unwilling prisoners, but as men who, when faced with the choice,
preferred, for whatever reason, to remain as non-contributing
individuals on the fringe of society. We must not let this happen,
gentlemen. The choice is there, make no mistake about it!</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: We must first choose a leader to unite us
together, and then venture out and return once more as contributing and
vital members of the greater organism of society.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: Aha!</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: ……because of the great pressure and bad air,
they never attain a height greater than four feet although some of them
are ferocious fighters and show great courage and skill. Whether they
are descendants of those who lost them- selves in the superstructure, or
whether they are actually a separate race, no one can tell. They depend
on their strange appearance and peculiar smell to fend off any
intruders, and they make the city shell a most unpleasant place in which
to be lost. The authorities tolerate a moderate amount of them at any
one time, but they must be kept under control with occasional sweep
campaigns, which is probably where this one came from.</p>
<p><strong>cam</strong>: Because of the great pressure and bad air, they
never attain…</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: I’ve got it! Astounding!</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: No one could have imagined anything
one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient
inquiry. This world is in a state of static-mobility: we are at the same
time moving and standing still.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind,
but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an
apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and
design.</p>
<p><strong>twa</strong>: However, for myself there is a great deal more
that I would like to know.</p>
<p><strong>nin</strong>: There goes another of your disciples.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: It seems I am destined to endure many
frustrations….but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the
thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if
it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.</p>
<p><strong>pto</strong>: Our life is brief and powerless. On all of us,
the slow, sure doom falls pitiless and dark. Blind to good and evil,
reckless of destruction, omnipotent authority rolls on its relentless
way. Condemned today to lose our friends, tomorrow ourselves to pass
through the gate of darkness, it remains only for us to cherish, before
the blow falls, the lofty thoughts that ennoble this little day;
disdaining the coward terrors of the slave of fate, to worship at the
shrine that our own hands have built; undismayed by the empire of
chance, to preserve a mind free from the wanton tyranny that rules our
outward life; proudly defiant of the irresistible forces that tolerate,
for a moment, out knowledge and our condemnation, to sustain alone,
weary but unyielding, the world that our own ideals have fashioned
despite the trampling march of unconscious power.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: What is the Freak doing? He chews, but he
doesn’t seem to eat. The longer it stays, the greater the mess. Nobody
lifts a finger. Isn’t anybody going to get rid of the damn thing? All of
its leavings are piling up.</p>
<p><strong>sen</strong>: I can’t do a good job. As soon as I get things
cleaned up….it’s hopeless, a hopeless task. I’m going to tell them I’ve
had it. They don’t know any better. Countless diversions. Deciding where
we are. Arguing about leaving. Trying to determine the future.
Ridiculous. What about keeping things livable here? Now? can’t hide
anything. I can’t put anything aside. Nothing can be saved, nothing….can
be hidden. They’re beginning to go into my corner and look for things.
Their things. They’re my things….. They’re going to take it all. I know
what they’re planning. After all my saving, starving…there must be
something else. Don’t you agree? You’re calculating…</p>
