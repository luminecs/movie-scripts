<h1 id="american-beauty">american-beauty</h1>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I need a father who’s a role model, not some
horny geek-boy who’s gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a
girlfriend home from school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
him out of his misery.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Want me to kill him for you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, would you?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
neighborhood. This is my street. This… is my life. I’m forty-two years
old. In less than a year, I’ll be dead.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Of course, I don’t know that yet. He rolls
over, looks up at us and sighs. He doesn’t seem too thrilled at the
prospect of a new day.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And in a way, I’m dead already.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Look at me, jerking off in the shower. This
will be the high point of my day. It’s all downhill from here.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: That’s my wife Carolyn. See the way the
handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That’s not
an accident.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: That’s our next-door neighbor Jim.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And that’s his lover, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: What in the world is wrong with her? She had
a walk this morning.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: And a jerky treat.</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: You spoil her. Bitsy. No bark. Come inside.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Good morning, Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Morning, Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I just love your tie! That color!</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: I just love your roses. How do you get them
to flourish like this?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle
Grow.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Man. I get exhausted just watching her.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: She wasn’t always like this. She used to be
happy. We used to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: My daughter Jane. Only child.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Janie’s a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that’s all going to
pass…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: But I don’t want to lie to her.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
unattractive?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, congratulations. You’ve succeeded
admirably.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester, could you make me a little later,
please? Because I’m not quite late enough.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Nice going, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Both my wife and daughter think I’m this
gigantic loser, and… they’re right.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I have lost something. I’m not exactly sure
what it is, but I know I didn’t always feel this… sedated. But you know
what? It’s never too late to get it back.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media
Monthly magazine, I’m calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?… Well, we’re all
under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information
about the product launch that isn’t even covered in your press release
and I… Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
’Cause he doesn’t ever seem to come in… Yeah, okay, I’ll leave my
number…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank
you!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Hey Les. You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: For you, Brad? I’ve got five.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m sure you can understand our need to cut
corners around here.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta
free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Exactly. So…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the
company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card
numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three
months?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: That’s unsubstantiated gossip.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: That’s fifty thousand dollars. That’s
somebody’s salary. That’s somebody who’s gonna get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Jesus. Calm down. Nobody’s getting fired yet.
That’s why we’re having everyone write out a job description, mapping
out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who’s
valuable and–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Who’s expendable.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s just business.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’ve been writing for this magazine for
fourteen years, Brad. You’ve been here how long, a whole month?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I’m one of the good guys, Les. I’m trying to
level with you. This is your one chance to save your job.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: –there is no decision, you just write the
damn thing!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You don’t think it’s weird and kinda
fascist?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Possibly. But you don’t want to be
unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, well, let’s just all sell our souls and
work for Satan, because it’s more convenient that way.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Could you be just a little bit more
dramatic, please, huh?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: So we’ve finally got new neighbors. You
know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of– –“The Real
Estate King,” that house would never have sat on the market for six
months.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, they were still mad at you for cutting
down their sycamore.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Their sycamore? C’mon! A substantial
portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How
can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn’t have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn’t partially mine, which of course it was.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Mom, do we always have to listen to this
elevator music?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No. No, we don’t. As soon as you’ve
prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I’m about to eat, you can
listen to whatever you like.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So Janie, how was school?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It was okay.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Just okay?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, you want to know how things went at my
job today?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: They’ve hired this efficiency expert, this
really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he’s basically
there to make it seem like they’re justified in firing somebody, because
they couldn’t just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that
would be too… honest. And so they’ve asked us– –you couldn’t possibly
care any less, could you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, what do you expect? You can’t all of a
sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I mean, hello. You’ve barely even spoken to me
for months.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, what, you’re mother-of-the-year? You
treat her like an employee.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m going to get some ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Honey, I’m sorry. I…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m sorry I haven’t been more available, I
just… I’m…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You know, you don’t always have to wait for
me to come to you…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, great. So now it’s my fault?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I didn’t say that. It’s nobody’s fault.
Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I will sell this house today.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I will sell this house today. I will sell
this house today. I will sell this house today.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I will sell this house today.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Welcome. I’m Carolyn Burnham!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: This living room is very dramatic. Wait
’til you see the native stone fireplace!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: A simple cream would really lighten things
up. You could even put in a skylight.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, why don’t we go into the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: It’s a dream come true for any cook. Just
filled with positive energy. Huh?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: …and you’ll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You know, you could have some really fun
backyard get-togethers out here.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: The ad said this pool was “lagoon-like.”
There’s nothing “lagoon-like” about it. Except for maybe the bugs.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: There’s not even any plants out here.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What do you call this? Is this not a plant?
If you have a problem with the plants, I can always call my landscape
architect. Solved.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: I mean, I think “lagoon,” I think
waterfall, I think tropical. This is a cement hole.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I have some tiki torches in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Shut up. Stop it. You… Weak!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Who are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: My parents are coming tonight. They’re trying
to, you know, take an active interest in me.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: They’re such assholes. Why can’t they just
have their own lives?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What makes you so sure she wants us to be
there? Did she ask us to come?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Of course not. She doesn’t want us to know
how important this is to her. But she’s been practicing her steps for
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, I bet money she’s going to resent it.
And I’m missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester, this is important. I’m sensing a
real distance growing between you and Jane.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Growing? She hates me.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: She’s just willful.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: She hates you too.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now, for your half-time
entertainment, Rockwell High’s award- winning Dancing Spartanettes!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: We can leave right after this, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh shit, they’re still here.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Janie!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Hi! I really enjoyed that!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Congratulations, honey, you were great.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I didn’t win anything.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hi, I’m Lester. Janie’s dad.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: This is my friend, Angela Hayes.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Okay, good to meet you. You were also good
tonight. Very… precise.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey, I’m so
proud of you. I watched you very closely, and you didn’t screw up once.
Okay, we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So, what are you girls doing now?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: We’re going out for pizza.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh really, do you need a ride? We can give
you a ride. I have a car. You wanna come with us?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thanks… but I have a car.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, you have a car. Oh. That’s great! That’s
great, because Janie’s thinking about getting a car soon too, aren’t
you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dad. Mom’s waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.
Any, uh, friend of Janie’s is a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well… I’ll be seeing you around then.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Could he be any more pathetic?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I think it’s sweet. And I think he and your
mother have not had sex in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s the weirdest thing.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I feel like I’ve been in a coma for about
twenty years, and I’m just now waking up.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Spec-tac-ular.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m sorry my dad was so weird tonight.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s okay. I’m used to guys drooling over
me. It started when I was about twelve, I’d go out to dinner with my
parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would
stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking. Just
like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Vomit.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: No, I liked it. And I still like it. If
people I don’t even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I
really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there’s
nothing worse in life than being ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I really think it’ll happen for you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, I know. Because everything that was
meant to happen, does. Eventually.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why’d you call me?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Well, my phone just rang and I answered it
and somebody hung up and then I star sixty-nined and it called you
back.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I was in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, gross.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Rick-y! Break-fast!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Be right there.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t eat bacon, remember?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m sorry, I must have forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What’s new in the world, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: This country is going straight to hell.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Are you expecting anyone?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: Welcome to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Just a little something from our garden.</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: Except for the pasta, we got that at
Fallaci’s.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: It’s unbelievably fresh. You just drop it in
the water and it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down. Welcome to the
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Nice to meet you. And this is my
partner…</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Let’s cut to the chase, okay? What are you
guys selling?</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new
neighbors–</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you’re
partners. So what’s your business?</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Well, he’s a tax attorney.</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: And he’s an anesthesiologist.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: How come these faggots always have to rub
it in your face? How can they be so shameless?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: That’s the whole thing, Dad. They don’t feel
like it’s anything to be ashamed of.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Well, it is.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah, you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Don’t placate me like I’m your mother,
boy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly, but
those fags make me want to puke my fucking guts out.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Me too, son. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m serious, he just pulled down his pants
and yanked it out. You know, like, say hello to Mr. Happy.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It wasn’t gross. It was kind of cool.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Of course I did. He is a really well- known
photographer? He shoots for Elle on like, a regular basis? It would have
been so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hey. That’s how things really are. You just
don’t know, because you’re this pampered little suburban chick.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Cunt! I am so sick of people taking their
insecurities out on me.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God. That’s the pervert who filmed me
last night.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Him? Jane. No way. He’s a total lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You know him?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I
was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird
things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie
Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental
institution.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why? What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, they can’t put you away just for saying
weird things.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You total slut. You’ve got a crush on
him.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What? Please.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You were defending him! You love him. You
want to have like, ten thousand of his babies.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi. My name’s Ricky. I just moved next door
to you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know. I kinda remember this really creepy
incident when you were filming me last night?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I didn’t mean to scare you. I just think
you’re interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Thanks, but I really don’t need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m not obsessing. I’m just curious.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What a freak. And why does he dress like a
Bible salesman?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He’s like, so confident. That can’t be
real.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I don’t believe him. I mean, he didn’t even
like, look at me once.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I’m sorry, what?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom. Nobody said anything.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: –everyone here is with their spouse or
their significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no
one?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, you always end up ignoring me and
going off–</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Now listen to me. This is an important
business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And
part of my job is to live that image–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Just say whatever you want to say and spare
me the propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Hi, Shirley! Listen, just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I am happy, honey.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh! Buddy!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’s so good to see you too, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Carolyn! Of course. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.</p>
<p><strong>christy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: My husband, Lester–</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, we’ve met before, actually. This thing
last year. Or the Christmas thing at the Sheraton.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s okay. I wouldn’t remember me
either.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Honey. Don’t be weird.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: All right, honey. I won’t be weird. I’ll be
whatever you want me to be.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: We have a very healthy relationship.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well. I don’t know about you, but I need a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Whoa. Put a little more in there,
cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Excuse me. Don’t you live on Robin Hood
Trail? The house with the red door?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the house
next to you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I’m Lester Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi, Lester Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Do you party?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Do you get high?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You know, I probably wouldn’t even tell you
this if I weren’t a little tipsy, but… I am in complete awe of you. I
mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate
firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. You
know, I’d love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you’d
ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I’m the “competition,” but… I
mean, hey, I don’t flatter myself that I’m even in the same league as
you…</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Absolutely. Call my secretary and have her
schedule a lunch.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I’ll do that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: …did you ever see that movie, where the
body’s walking around holding its own head? And then the head goes down
on that babe?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Re-Animator.</p>
<p><strong>catering boss</strong>: Look. I’m not paying you to… …do
whatever it is you’re doing out here.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine. So don’t pay me.</p>
<p><strong>catering boss</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I quit. So you don’t have to pay me. Now,
leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>catering boss</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I think you just became my personal hero.
Doesn’t that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I
guess when you’re all of, what? Sixteen?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Eighteen. I just do these gigs as a cover. I
have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when
I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Honey, this is… Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky
Fitts.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the house
next to you. I go to school with your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: With Jane? Really?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yeah. Jane.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Hi. I’m ready to go. I’ll meet you out
front.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Uh-oh. I’m in trouble. Nice meeting you,
Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Any time.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Lester. If you want any more, you know where
I live.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh, shit. They’re home. Quick, let’s go up to
my room.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I should say hi to your dad. I don’t want to
be rude.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’re looking good, Mr. Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Last time I saw you, you looked kind of
wound up. Ooh, is that root beer?</p>
<p><strong>back in real time</strong>: She grabs the root beer and
smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I love root beer, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Mom, you remember Angela.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Yes, of course!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I forgot to tell you, she’s spending the
night. Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m sorry about my dad.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Don’t be. I think it’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, to you, he’s just another guy who wants
to jump your bones. But to me… he’s just too embarrassing to live.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Your mom’s the one who’s embarrassing. What
a phony.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Your dad’s actually kind of cute.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: He is. If he just worked out a little, he’d
be hot.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, come on. Like you’ve never sneaked a
peek at him in his underwear? I bet he’s got a big dick.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You are so grossing me out right now.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: If he built up his chest and arms, I would
totally fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I would! I would suck your dad’s big fat
dick, and then I would fuck him ’til his eyes rolled back in his head!
What was that noise? Jane.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I swear I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, it was the sound of you being a huge
disgusting pig.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh my God. Jane.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: It’s that psycho next door. Jane, what if he
worships you? What if he’s got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded
by dead people’s heads and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Shit. I bet he’s filming us right now.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Shit. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Welcome to America’s Weirdest Home
Videos.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Ricky!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Coming, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You know I don’t like locked doors in my
house, boy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I’m sorry, I must have locked it by accident.
So what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I need a urine sample.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wow. It’s been six months already. Can I give
it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yeah, I suppose. Well. Good night, son.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’ve been waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You’ve been working out, haven’t you? I can
tell.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I was hoping you’d give me a bath… I’m very,
very dirty.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You were masturbating.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I was not.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Yes, you were.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: All right, so shoot me. I was whacking
off.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: That’s right. I was choking the bishop.
Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my monster.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: That’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, excuse me, but I still have blood
pumping through my veins!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: So do I!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Really? I’m the only one who seems to be
doing anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is
not a marriage.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: This hasn’t been a marriage for years. But
you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I’ve
changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you’re
obviously not going to help me out in that department.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh. I see. You think you’re the only one
who’s sexually frustrated?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m not? Well then, come on, baby! I’m
ready.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Do not mess with me, mister, or I will
divorce you so fast it’ll make your head spin!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: On what grounds? I’m not a drunk, I don’t
fuck other women, I don’t mistreat you, I’ve never hit you, or even
tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how
unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got
your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of
what’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Turn out the light when you come to bed,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s a great thing when you realize you
still have the ability to surprise yourself. Makes you wonder what else
you can do that you’ve forgotten about.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hey! You guys!</p>
<p><strong>jim #2</strong>: Lester, I didn’t know you ran.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, I just started.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I figured you guys might be able to give me
some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>jim #1</strong>: Well, are you just looking to lose weight,
or do you want have increased strength and flexibility as well?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I want to look good naked.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What is this, the fucking gay pride
parade?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hey! Yo! Ricky! My entire life is passing
before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next door.
We haven’t met.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the, uh…
I was gonna… the movie we talked about…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Re-Animator.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want to borrow it? Okay, it’s up in my
room. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Can you hold this for a sec?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t think my dad would try to come in
when somebody else is here, but you never know.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Urine. I have to take a drug test every six
months to make sure I’m clean.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Are you kidding? You just smoked with me
last night.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s not mine. One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician’s office. I cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean
piss.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You like Pink Floyd?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I like a lot of music.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Man, I haven’t listened to this album in
years.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How much do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I don’t know, it’s been a while. How much is
an ounce?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Well, this is totally decent, and it’s three
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But this shit is top of the line. It’s called
G-13. Genetically engineered by the U.S. Government. Extremely potent.
But a completely mellow high, no paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Is that what we smoked last night?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This is all I ever smoke.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Two grand.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Jesus. Things have changed since 1973.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You don’t have to pay now. I know you’re good
for it.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: There’s a card in there with my beeper
number, call me anytime day or night. And I only accept cash.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, now I know how you can afford all this
equipment. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer just to be
able to buy an eight track.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: That sucks.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: No actually, it was great. All I did was
party and get laid. I had my whole life ahead of me…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: My dad thinks I pay for all this with
catering jobs. Never underestimate the power of denial.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Uh-oh, mom’s mad.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Bench presses. I’m going to wail on my pecs,
and then I’m going to do my back.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I see you’re smoking pot now. I’m so glad.
I think using illegal psychotropic substances is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You’re one to talk, you bloodless, money-
grubbing freak.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester. You have such hostility in you!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Do you mind? I’m trying to work out here.
Unless you want to spot me.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You will not get away with this. You can be
sure of that!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: That’s. What. You. Think.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: “…my job consists of basically masking my
contempt for the assholes in charge, and, at least once a day, retiring
to the men’s room so I can jerk off, while I fantasize about a life that
doesn’t so closely resemble hell.” Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Brad, for fourteen years I’ve been a whore
for the advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if
I start firebombing.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end
of the day.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, just what sort of severance package is
“management” prepared to offer me?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Considering the information I have about our
editorial director buying pussy with company money.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Which I’m sure would interest the I.R.S.,
since it technically constitutes fraud. And I’m sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications might like to know about it as well.
Not to mention, Craig’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: One year’s salary, with benefits.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: That’s not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, what do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Against who?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Against you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Can you prove you didn’t offer to save my
job if I’d let you blow me?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Man. You are one twisted fuck.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Nope. I’m just an ordinary guy with nothing
to lose.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy left
for New York this morning, and… let’s just say things were very hectic
around the house.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What’s she doing in New York?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: She’s moving there. Yes. We are splitting
up.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Buddy. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yes, according to her, I’m too focused on my
career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw.
Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my
success afforded her. Oh. Wow. Ah, it’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: When I saw you two at the party the other
night, you seemed perfectly happy.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Well, call me crazy, but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful, one must project an image of success, at
all times.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I was filming this dead bird.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Because it’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I think maybe you forgot your medication
today, mental boy.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Hi, Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look. I want you to stop filming me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Well, whatever. This is boring. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Do you need a ride?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Are you crazy? I don’t want to end up hacked
to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s okay. I’ll walk. But thanks.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Yeah, see? He doesn’t want to go anyway.
C’mon, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I think I’m going to walk, too.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What? Jane, that’s like, almost a mile.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Yes! Oh, God! I love it!</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You like getting nailed by the king?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh yes! I love it! Fuck me, your
majesty!</p>
<p><strong>drive-thru girl</strong>: Smile you’re at Mr. Smiley’s.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>drive-thru girl</strong>: Would you like to try our new bacon
and egg fajita just a dollar twenty-nine for a limited time only.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Uh… no. But thank you. I’ll have a Big Barn
Burger, Smiley fries, and an orange soda.</p>
<p><strong>drive-thru girl</strong>: Please drive up to the window,
thank you.</p>
<p><strong>drive-thru girl</strong>: Smile, you’re at Mr. Smiley’s,
that’ll be four eighty-nine, please.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl</strong>: Would you like some Smiley Sauce?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: No. No, actually… I’d like to fill out an
application.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl</strong>: There’s not jobs for manager, it’s
just for counter.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Good. I’m looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I don’t think you’d fit in here.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I have fast food experience.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yeah, like twenty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Well, I’m sure there have been amazing
technological advances in the industry, but surely you have some sort of
training process. It seems unfair to presume I won’t be able to
learn.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: That was exactly what I needed. The royal
treatment, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I was so stressed out.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Know what I do when I feel like that?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I fire a gun.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range
downtown, and I just pop off a few rounds.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I’ve never fired a gun before.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Oh, you’ve gotta try it. Nothing makes you
feel more powerful. Well, almost nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: So how do you like your new house?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: The people who used to live there fed these
stray cats, so they were always around, and it drove my mother nuts. And
then she cut down their tree.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Have you ever known anybody who died?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, but I did see this homeless woman who
froze to death once. Just laying there on the sidewalk. She looked
really sad.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I got that homeless woman on video.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why would you film that?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Because it was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What was amazing about it?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: When you see something like that, it’s like
God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you’re careful,
you can look right back.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: And what do you see?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Beauty.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom, I want you to meet somebody. Mom.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I want you to meet somebody. This is
Jane.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, my. I apologize for the way things look
around here.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: This is where my dad hides out.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I take it he’s got a thing for guns.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You got to see this one thing…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: My dad would kill me if he knew I was in
here.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Did you steal his keys?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He was
short on cash one night, so I let him pay me in trade.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Turn it over.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s like official state china of the Third
Reich. There’s a whole subculture of people who collect this Nazi shit.
But my dad just has this one thing.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, you’re scared of me.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You want to see the most beautiful thing I’ve
ever filmed?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It was one of those days when it’s a minute
away from snowing. And there’s this electricity in the air, you can
almost hear it, right? And this bag was just… dancing with me. Like a
little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That’s the
day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this
incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason
to be afraid. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Video’s a poor excuse, I know. But it helps
me remember… I need to remember…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Sometimes there’s so much beauty in the world
I feel like I can’t take it… and my heart is going to cave in.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh my God. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No, no, that’s quite all right, dear. Your
father and I were just discussing his day at work. Why don’t you tell
our daughter about it, honey?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Janie, today I quit my job. And then I told
my boss to fuck himself, and then I blackmailed him for almost sixty
thousand dollars. Pass the asparagus.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Your father seems to think this kind of
behavior is something to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And your mother seems to prefer I go through
life like a fucking prisoner while she keeps my dick in a mason jar
under the sink.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: How dare you speak to me that way in front
of her? And I marvel that you can be so contemptuous of me, on the same
day that you lose your job!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Lose it? I didn’t lose it. It’s not like,
“Oops, where’d my job go?” I quit. Someone pass me the asparagus.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for putting
me under the added pressure of being the sole breadwinner now–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I already have a job.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No, no, don’t give a second thought as to
who’s going to pay the mortgage. We’ll just leave it all up to Carolyn.
You mean, you’re going to take care of everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I
don’t mind. I really don’t. You mean, everything? You don’t mind having
the sole responsibility, your husband feels he can just quit his
job–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Will someone pass me the fucking
asparagus?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Okay, I’m not going to be a part of this–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m sick and tired of being treated like I
don’t exist. You two do whatever you want to do whenever you want to do
it and I don’t complain. All I want is the same courtesy–</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, you don’t complain? Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if you don’t complain. What is
this?! Am I locked away in a padded cell somewhere, hallucinating?
That’s the only explanation I can think of–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Don’t interrupt me, honey.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh, and another thing. From now on, we’re
going to alternate our dinner music. Because frankly, and I don’t think
I’m alone here, I’m really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Go. Away.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Honey, please let me in.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I wish that you hadn’t witnessed that awful
scene tonight. But in a way, I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad
really are?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Aw, Christ, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: No, I’m glad because you’re old enough now
to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone
except yourself. You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It’s sad,
but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look, Mom, I really don’t feel like having a
Kodak moment here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You ungrateful little brat. Just look at
everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn’t
even have our own house.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You little bastard–</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: How did you get in there?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: How!? How?! C’mon, get up! Fight back, you
little pussy!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, sir. I won’t fight you.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: How did you get in there?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I picked the lock, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What were you looking for? Money? Are you
on dope again?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend your
Nazi plate.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes, sir. She lives next door.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Her name’s Jane.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: This is for your own good, boy. You have no
respect for other people’s things, for authority, for…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Sir, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You can’t just go around doing whatever you
feel like, you can’t–there are rules in life–</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You need structure, you need
discipline–</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for trying to
teach me. Don’t give up on me, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Oh, Ricky…</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You stay out of there.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first
came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you’re a natural.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, all I know is… I love shooting this
gun!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Ah, whose car is that out front?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I
always wanted and now I have it. I rule!</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Where’s the Camry?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I traded it in.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Shouldn’t you have consulted me first?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hmm, let me think… No. You never drove it.
Have you done something different? You look great.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Where’s Jane?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Jane not home. We have the whole house to
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Christ, Carolyn. When did you become so…
joyless?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens
to be a lot about me that you don’t know, mister smarty man. There is
plenty of joy in my life.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Whatever happened to that girl who used to
fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up
to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic
helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I
haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester. You’re going to spill beer on the
couch.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So what? It’s just a couch.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: This is a four thousand dollar sofa
upholstered in Italian silk. This is not “just a couch.”</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s just a couch!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: This isn’t life. This is just stuff. And
it’s become more important to you than living. Well, honey, that’s just
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m only trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: It’s weird, watching myself. I don’t like how
I look.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I can’t believe you don’t know how beautiful
you are.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m not going to sit here for that shit.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Ha. How does it feel now?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You don’t feel naked?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I am naked.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Tell me about being in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking
dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I
told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right? Well, of
course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me…
and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut,
and… I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him.
If they hadn’t pulled me off. That’s when my dad put me in the hospital.
Then they drugged me up and left me in there for two years.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Wow. You must really hate him.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: He’s not a bad man.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well… you better believe I’d hate my father if
he did something like that to me. Wait. I do hate my father.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: He’s a total asshole and he’s got this crush
on my friend Angela and it’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You’d rather he had the crush on you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Gross, no! But it’d be nice if I was anywhere
near as important to him as she is.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I know you think my dad’s harmless, but you’re
wrong. He’s doing massive psychological damage to me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, now, I too need structure. A little
fucking discipline.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m serious, though. How could he not be
damaging me? I need a father who’s a role model, not some horny geek-boy
who’s gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from
school. What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his
misery.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Want me to kill him for you?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, would you?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’ll cost you.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, I’ve been baby-sitting since I was about
ten. I’ve got almost three thousand dollars. ’Course, I was saving it up
for a boob job.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: But my tits can wait, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You know, that’s not a very nice thing to do,
hiring somebody to kill your dad.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, I guess I’m just not a very nice girl,
then, am I?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You know I’m not serious, right?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Do you know how lucky we are to have found
each other?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Remember those posters that said, “Today is
the first day of the rest of your life?” Well, that’s true of every day
except one. The day you die.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Jane, hurry up. I’ve got a very important
appointment–</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Well, of course, she’s always welcome. You
know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven’t seen her around
here in a while.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’ve been too embarrassed to bring her over.
Because of you, and the way that you behave.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: What are you talking about? I’ve barely even
spoken to her.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dad! You stare at her all the time, like
you’re drunk! It’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You better watch yourself, Janie, or you’re
going to turn into a real bitch, just like your mother.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: You ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Oh, I don’t need a ride. I’m going to go in
with Jane and her mom.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yo, Ricky. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>co-worker</strong>: Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with
cheese, A.S.A.P.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You need more than that, my little
hombre.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: What’s good here?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Then I guess we’ll just have to be bad,
won’t we? I think I’ll have a double Smiley Sandwich and curly fries,
and a vanilla shake.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Make that two.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl</strong>: Please drive around thank you.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I think we deserve a little junk food,
after the workout we had this morning.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m flattered.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Smile! You’re at Mr. Smiley’s!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Would you like to try our new beef and
cheese pot pie on a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a limited time
only?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is
my–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Her husband. We’ve met before, but something
tells me you’re going to remember me this time.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl</strong>: Whoa. You are so busted.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: You know, this really doesn’t concern
you.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru
manager, so you kind of are on her turf. So. This makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, Lester–</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Honey, it’s okay. I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Lester, just stop it!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Uh-uh. You don’t get to tell me what to do.
Ever again.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’m sorry. I guess we should cool it for a
while. I’m facing a potentially very expensive divorce.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Oh, no. I understand completely. In order
to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all
times.</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: Stop it. Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I have to run next door. Jane left her
geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: So you and psycho boy are fucking on like, a
regular basis now, right?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a
big dick?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Look, I’m not gonna talk about his dick with
you, okay? It’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Not like what? Doesn’t he have one? Why
don’t you want to talk about it? I mean, I tell you every single detail
about every guy that I fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yeah, and maybe you shouldn’t, all right?
Maybe I don’t really want to hear all that.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend, you’re
like, above it? We gotta get you a real man.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You got any papers?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there.
You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. “No I can’t.
Really. Okay.”</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You should learn to roll a joint.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Oh. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Where’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Hi, Mr. Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wow. Look at you. Have you been working
out?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Some.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You can really tell. Look at those arms.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You like muscles?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I–I should probably go see what Jane’s up
to.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Where’d you get that?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: From my job.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Don’t lie to me. I saw you with him.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You were watching me?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: What did he make you do?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Dad, you don’t really think… me and
Mr. Burnham?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Don’t you laugh at me!</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I will not sit back and watch my only son
become a cocksucker!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Jesus, what is with you–</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: I swear to God, I will throw you out of
this house and never look at you again.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You mean that?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Damn straight I do. I’d rather you were
dead than be a fucking faggot.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: You’re right. I suck dick for money.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Boy–</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Two thousand dollars. I’m that good.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: And you should see me fuck. I’m the best
piece of ass in three states.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Get out!! I don’t ever want to see you
again!!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: What a sad old man you are.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom, I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Okay, wear a raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I wish things would have been better for you.
Take care of Dad.</p>
<p><strong>tape voice</strong>: –disinvesting problems of their power,
and removing their ability to make us afraid. This is the secret to “me-
centered” living.</p>
<p><strong>tape voice</strong>: Only by taking full responsibility for
your problems–and their solutions–will you ever be able to break free
from the constant cycle of victimhood.</p>
<p><strong>tape voice</strong>: Remember, you are only a victim if you
choose to be a victim…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I don’t think we could be friends anymore.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You are way too uptight about sex.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Just don’t fuck my dad, all right? Please?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Dad! Leave us alone!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: If I had to leave tonight, would you come
with me?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: If I had to go to New York. To live. Tonight.
Would you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You guys can’t be serious. You’re just a
kid. And he’s like, a mental case. You’ll end up living in a box on the
street.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: I’m no more a kid than you are! We can use my
plastic surgery money.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: We won’t have to. I have over forty thousand
dollars. And I know people in the city who can help us get set up.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What, other drug dealers?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Jane, you’d be out of your mind to go with
him.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Why do you even care?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Because you’re my friend!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: She’s not your friend. She’s somebody you use
to feel better about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Go fuck yourself, psycho!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: You shut up, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Jane! He is a freak!</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Well, then so am I! And we’ll always be freaks
and we’ll never be like other people. And you’ll never be a freak
because you’re just too perfect.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, at least I’m not ugly.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Yes, you are. And you’re boring. And you’re
totally ordinary. And you know it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You two deserve each other.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Jesus, man. You’re soaked.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You want me to get Ricky? He’s in Jane’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Where’s your wife?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Uh… I don’t know. Probably out fucking that
dorky prince of real estate asshole. And you know what? I don’t
care.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Your wife is with another man and you don’t
care?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Nope, our marriage is just for show. A
commercial, for how normal we are. When we are anything but.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You’re shaking.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: We really should get you out of these
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Just tell me what you need.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. I’m sorry. You got the
wrong idea.</p>
<p><strong>tape voice</strong>: “I refuse to be a victim.” When this
becomes your mantra, constantly running through your head–</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I refuse to be a victim.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I hope you don’t mind if I play the
stereo.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Not at all. Bad night?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Not really bad, just… strange.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Believe me. It couldn’t possibly be any
stranger than mine.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Jane and I had a fight. It was about
you.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She’s mad at me because I said I think
you’re sexy.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Do you want a sip?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: So… are you going to tell me? What you
want?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Are you kidding? I want you. I’ve wanted you
since the first moment I saw you. You are the most beautiful thing I
have ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: You don’t think I’m ordinary?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You couldn’t be ordinary if you tried.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Thank you. I don’t think there’s anything
worse than being ordinary…</p>
<p><strong>carolyn</strong>: I refuse to be a victim. I refuse to be a
victim. I refuse to be a victim… Lester, I have something I have to say
to you…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I don’t get scared.</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: My parents will try to find me.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mine won’t.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: This is my first time.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I still want to do it… I just thought I
should tell you… in case you wondered why I wasn’t… better.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What’s wrong? I thought you said I was
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You are beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You are so beautiful… and I would be a very
lucky man…</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I feel so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You have nothing to be sorry about.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: It’s okay. Everything’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Wow. I was starving.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Do you want me to make you another one?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: No, no, no. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I mean, I’m still a little weirded out, but…
…I feel better. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: How’s Jane?</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I mean, how’s her life? Is she happy? Is she
miserable? I’d really like to know, and she’d die before she’d ever tell
me about it.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: She’s… she’s really happy. She thinks she’s
in love.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Good for her.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: God, it’s been a long time since anybody
asked me that. I’m great.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: I’ve gotta go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I’m great.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Man oh man… Man oh man oh man…</p>
<p><strong>jane</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I had always heard your entire life flashes
in front of your eyes the second before you die.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: First of all, that one second isn’t a second
at all, it stretches on forever, like an ocean of time…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: For me, it was lying on my back at Boy Scout
camp, watching falling stars…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And yellow leaves, from the maple trees,
that lined my street…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: Or my grandmother’s hands, and the way her
skin seemed like paper…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And the first time I saw my cousin Tony’s
brand new Firebird…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And Janie…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And Janie…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: And… Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: I guess I could be pretty pissed off about
what happened to me… but it’s hard to stay mad, when there’s so much
beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m seeing it all at once,
and it’s too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that’s about to
burst…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: …and then I remember to relax, and stop
trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I
can’t feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid
little life… You have no idea what I’m talking about, I’m sure. But
don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>lester</strong>: You will someday.</p>
