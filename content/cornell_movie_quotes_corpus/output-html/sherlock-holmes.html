<h1 id="sherlock-holmes">sherlock-holmes</h1>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The year was 1891. London was the capital of
the world – the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of
coal in the air. It was also the great cesspool into which all the
sinners and criminals of the empire drained.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I had come to London, ten years prior, to
find a life after the Afghan war. I had hoped to start a medical
practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. The life I found was
anything but nice and steady.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And that had everything to do with one man.
My friend, my partner, my burden…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: … Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>1 continued: 1</strong>: The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to
assist, but instead just picks up the smoker’s broken umbrella and
studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat’s eyes widen as he recognizes
his famous assailant.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sherlock Holmes?!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson,
221B Baker Street.</p>
<p><strong>int. carriage - closeup on the officers - night</strong>:
inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry – a 19th century
SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader, older than the rest,
INSPECTOR LESTRADE.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Head cocked to the left, partial deafness in
right ear. First point of attack.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Then throat, paralyze vocal chords, stop
screaming.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker – knuckles
to liver.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: What’s goin’ on, John?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson. Perfect timing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nice hat.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Just got it. Where’s Lestrade?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Getting his troops in formation. Is that
your blood or theirs?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I don’t know. It’s an old shirt.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You left this behind.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Knew I’d forgotten something. Thought I’d
left the stove on.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Right. Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Des?</p>
<p><strong>7 continued: 7</strong>: He can see the hat, but not the man
underneath.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yeah, s’me.</p>
<p><strong>7 continued: 7</strong>: Watson takes out the two men. He is
more of a brawler, using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but
no less effective.</p>
<p><strong>a woman in white lies inside a crudely-painted
pentacle</strong>: , lit with candles at each corner. Her eyes roll back
in her head, trance-like. A sword has been placed at her feet.</p>
<p><strong>int. cathedral crypts</strong>: The second hooded figure
moves back and melts into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The girl.</p>
<p><strong>9a continued: 9a</strong>: The girl bends with alarming and
mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready
to plunge the point into her heart.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Lord Blackwood?!</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
well.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Stay right there.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how
did you like my work? The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before
I’d finished the first incision.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>9a continued: 9a</strong>: Holmes seems to be pointing at
Blackwood. Watson looks, sees nothing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: What a shame. That would’ve been fun.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Impeccable timing, Lestrade.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Is that – ?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’ve gone for the doctor… And one for the
rope.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: You should’ve waited for my help.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If I had, you’d be cleaning up a corpse and
chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl’s parents hired me, not the Yard. I
can’t imagine why they thought you’d need any assistance.</p>
<p><strong>9a continued: 9a</strong>: Lestrade turns, frustrated. He
watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on
him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She’s still
mouthing the incantation.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: What do you make of that?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed
beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon. The double circle’s
for his own protection.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: London will breathe a sigh of relief –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: – at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As
usual.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>and doctor beat cops to the punch again! roommates
solve</strong>: BRIXTON MURDERS! Another picture of Holmes and Watson.
This time, they look more confident, the article bigger.</p>
<p><strong>int. lab</strong>: A negative is clipped over the paper. A
sudden flash of light as it is exposed.</p>
<p><strong>mystery… celebrated detective proves guilty man</strong>:
INNOCENT… More and more headlines, Holmes and Watson getting older,
solving crimes, and…</p>
<p><strong>ext. 221 baker st. - afternoon</strong>: Autumn has turned to
winter.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: 71 over 104… very good, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain philips</strong>: Me nerves are the best they been in
years, thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>12 continued: 12</strong>: Watson is pleased by that.</p>
<p><strong>captain philips</strong>: Tell me something – your new
offices. There won’t be so many stairs, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No – ground floor. And there’ll be a woman’s
touch, too.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I think we can start to wean you off the
medicine –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let’s give it a little longer, just to be
safe. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>12 continued: 12</strong>: He heads out, letting his
aggravation show once his back is turned to his patient.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: I won’t go in there by myself, not
while he’s in this state.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re not going in at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: What will I do when you leave? He’ll
burn the house down around me. What will he do? Couldn’t you have a
longer engagement?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: He just needs a new case, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I smell burning.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Why don’t you take Captain Philips and give
him a nice cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Come on, Captain, let’s go down. It’ll
be quieter.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And perhaps some tea and bread up here when
you can.</p>
<p><strong>13 continued: 13</strong>: Nonetheless, Watson stops, takes a
deep breath, gathers himself. Something like this has happened before
the difference being, now, that Watson is sick to death of dealing with
it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: May I join you in the armory?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Please… Watson, I’ve been working on a
device which will suppress the sound of a gunshot.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Please… Don’t, don’t, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It needs work. May I see?…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Gently, gently, Watson…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s been three months since the last case.
About time you found another one.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I can’t but agree. My mind rebels at
stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. The sooner the better.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Paper?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let’s see, we have a letter here from
Mrs. Ramsey in Queen’s Park – her husband has gone missing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He’s in Belgium with the scullery maid. Is
it December?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, Holmes. Lady Radford reports a missing
emerald bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Insurance swindle. Lord Radford likes fast
women and slow ponies. I see you’re the attending physician at
Blackwood’s hanging.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, it’s our last case together and I
wanted to see it through to the end.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mr. Lewis is seeking…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There is only one case that intrigues me at
present… the curious case of Mrs. Hudson, the absentee landlady.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I have been studying her comings and goings
and they appear most sinister.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: Tea, Mr. Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Is it poisoned, nanny?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: There’s enough of that in you
already.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t touch that. Everything is in its
proper place, as per usual.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. hudson</strong>: He’s killed the dog… again.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What have you done to Gladstone this
time?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I was simply testing a new anesthetic. He
doesn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! As your doctor…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He’ll be right as a trivet in no time.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: … and your friend, you’ve been in this room
for two weeks. I insist you get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There’s nothing of interest to me out there,
on earth, at all.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: So, you have nothing to do?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Then you’re free this evening.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: For dinner.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The Royale.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My favorite.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Mary’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not available.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re meeting her, Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Have you proposed yet?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m still looking for the right ring.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Then it’s not official.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s happening, like it or not. Half past
eight. The Royale.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And wear a jacket.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes! You’re early.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Fashionably.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: May I present Miss Mary Morstan.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My pleasure. For the life of me I don’t know
why it’s taken him so long to get us properly introduced.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The pleasure’s mine. It really is a thrill to
meet you, Mr. Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve a whole stack of detective novels at
home. Poe, Wilkie Collins…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They can seem a bit far-fetched sometimes,
though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, no no. The little details are by far the
most important. Take Watson…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: … see that walking-stick? A rare African
snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to
veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he’s a decorated soldier.
Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military
men. Then I check his pockets… ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can
infer he’s a bit of a gambler. I’d keep an eye on that, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Those days are behind me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, right behind you. He’s cost us the rent
more than once.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know
him. But what about a perfect stranger? What can you tell about me?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I don’t think that’s necessary –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, I doubt –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, it’d be wonderful. I insist.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You insist? She insisted. You’re a
governess.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, well done. So shall we –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Your student’s a boy of 8.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Charlie’s 7, actually.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s breathing. Then he’s tall for his
age.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He flicked ink at you today.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is there ink on my face?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with your face.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: The gentleman has already ordered for
himself. What would madam care for this evening?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Give us a few minutes, please.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There are two drops on your ear… India
blue’s nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by
the boy, but you’re too experienced to react rashly – which is why the
lady you work for lent you that necklace. It’s from Asprey’s, flawless,
not the gems of a governess. However, the jewels you’re not wearing tell
us rather more.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You were engaged.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where
it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Or at least until someone informed you of
its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the
engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor
perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Right on all counts but one. I didn’t leave my
fiance… he died.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well done, old man.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>15a-17 omittedint. punch bowl pub - bare-knuckle boxing fight
- 5a-17</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>15a-17 continued: 15a-17</strong>: He’s able to feel, not
just think. He is utterly in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well done. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank
you, it was most pleasurable.</p>
<p><strong>15a-17 continued: 15a-17</strong>: Face twisted in disgust,
McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him
on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hm. Plymouth gin.</p>
<p><strong>int. pentonville prison - corridor - night</strong>: A candle
shivers, casting jagged shadows. A row of stone cells. The sound of
prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A full-scale riot is on.</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: Charlie, what the hell’s going on
down here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from
doing his spells. And now he’s in some kind of fit.</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: the cell next to</p>
<p><strong>int. pentonville prison - blackwood’s cell - night</strong>:
Blackwood sits dead center in the dark. Eyes closed, WHISPERING ungodly
sounds.</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: All right, Blackwood, what’s this all
about?</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I’ve a request.</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: You don’t get nothin’ `til you stop
this devil nonsense. That’s a holy book –</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: – and you will respect it!</p>
<p><strong>guard captain</strong>: Boy, you want me to muzzle you –</p>
<p><strong>19 continued: 19</strong>: Blackwood keeps whispering. The
Captain falls to one knee, keeps coughing.</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Get him to the infirmary, now!</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I’ve a request.</p>
<p><strong>int. punch bowl pub - attic</strong>: Watson walks down a
dingy hallway towards a door. With a look of resignation, he opens the
door to see Holmes sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished
room.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You know this is for eye surgery?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I find that it lifts my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s a pathological amorbic process, it
increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction
comes on you afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale,
they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Really? What about when you – oops –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Let’s go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville
Prison.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s your job, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re Blackwood’s last request. Says he has
information he’ll give only to you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Look at that structure. What has it been?
Five years’ work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of
bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the
way. You weren’t there so I laid your customary bet –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’re right… I’ll keep it with your check
book, locked safely away in my drawer.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni
and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural
inclination this evening.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You have the grand gift of silence, Watson.
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And your grand gift is the uncanny ability
to demoralize people. I was aware she’d been engaged. She told me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So that’s a `no’ to the opera then?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’s my waistcoat.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s too small for you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well, it’s my property and I want it
back.</p>
<p><strong>23 continued: 23</strong>: Holmes hands him the waistcoat
which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns,
looks out the opposite window.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You go ahead. I’ve no business with him
while he’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where are all the other prisoners?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were
going to have a riot on our hands. There’s something about him… it’s
like he can get inside your head.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m sure I can find my own way from here, if
you have other duties to attend to.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>int. pentonville prison - blackwood’s cell - day</strong>:
Holmes approaches Blackwood’s cell, strolling insouciantly. No way this
creep’s getting to him. In the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood,
who’s reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: QUOTE from Revelations tbd…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Love what you’ve done with the place.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Thank you for joining me.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A small point of concern.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’d already followed the murders with some
interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I
couldn’t but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush –</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You’re too kind.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: However, by comparison, your work in the
crypt was akin to a finger painting.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: So now you’re curious as to whether
there’s a larger game afoot, and that’s why you’re really here.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead
shortly and I thought I might keep him company.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake
is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error
in judgement is to assume I’ve been holding the brush at all – I am
merely the channel.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My only wish is that I’d caught you earlier.
I might have spared five lives.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Those lives were a necessity, a
sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a
greater purpose.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I wonder if they’d let Watson and I dissect
your brain – after you’re hanged, of course. I’d wager there’s some
deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve
a greater purpose, too.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I’m
concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events. For you and I
are bound on a journey that will twist the very fabric of nature. I
sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel
your mind, Holmes, I need you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I must say, you’ve come a long way down from
the House of Lords.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: But I will rise again.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Bon voyage, Blackwood.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Pay attention! Three more shall die, and
there is nothing you can do to save them.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You must accept that this is beyond your
control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible
it will be the last sane thought in your head.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t think you’re needed, Father. Not for
this one.</p>
<p><strong>int. pentonville prison - gallows</strong>: The room where
the execution takes place is packed to the rafters with senior
officials, members of the government and cops. We get a good look at
some of the faces. Watson is there too. Blackwood walks up into the
noose.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Death is only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>int. 221 baker street - day</strong>: Holmes is out cold,
lying on his tiger skin rug.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: London’s so bleak this time of year.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the
stairs near Holmes’ lab, cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches
her every move as she crosses to him. She leans down, putting the
walnuts in front of him and flashes him a smile.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Not that I’m pining for New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I prefer to travel in the winter.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I brought a few souvenirs. Dates from Jordan,
tea from Ceylon and olives from Cyclades. I thought we’d have a little
tea party to cheer us up.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I came across this as I was setting up.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Theft of Velasquez portrait from the King of
Spain… Missing naval documents lead to resignation of Bulgarian Prime
Minister… Scandalous affair ends engagement of Hapsburg Prince to
Romanov Princess.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Simply studying your methodology for when
the authorities ask me to hunt you down.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I don’t see my name anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: But your signature is clear.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ah, the Maharajah’s missing diamond. Another
souvenir?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: He has a palace full of them. Let’s not dwell
on the past.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: By the looks of things you’re between cases
at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And you, husbands. No ring?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: He snored. I’m Irene Adler again and I need
your help to find someone. There’s nobody more brilliant or who knows
London better than you. Plus, it’s a wonderful opportunity to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Why are you so suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Should I answer chronologically or
alphabetically?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: This is all the information you need.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who are you working for?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’m my own man.</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: She stands and pulls out a large
bag of coins.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Keep your money. I didn’t say I’d take the
case.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: They gave me our old room.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Hello, John.</p>
<p><strong>int. carriage</strong>: Irene sits, turns to address a
man-shaped shadow filling the opposite corner of the carriage. Before
she can speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is</p>
<p><strong>moriarty</strong>: I assume he’ll do it?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Not for money, but for me. I wager he’ll find
our man within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>moriarty</strong>: You wager?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>moriarty</strong>: A better word. I sincerely hope it’s
accurate.</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: Ow, me leg!</p>
<p><strong>coach driver</strong>: Get out of it!</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: You run me over, sir, yes you did!</p>
<p><strong>coach driver</strong>: You fell right into the carriage!</p>
<p><strong>beggar</strong>: A little charity would go a long way, yes it
would, sir.</p>
<p><strong>34 continued: 34</strong>: He reaches toward the window.
Within a nanosecond, Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL
appears, delivered by a concealed mechanism .</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look at you, I can’t believe you ran after
her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a
masochist?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Allow me to explain.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Don’t you remember what she did to you? She
turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I’m sorry, you
were going to explain something…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you, I –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I know, instead of just being tricked into
being a witness at her wedding like last time –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I don’t believe –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You dress up as clergyman and actually
perform the ceremony. She’d love that.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’ve had your fun.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What’s she after, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now it’s time to press on.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now it’s time to press on.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Go on. I won’t interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It doesn’t matter –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What could she possibly need? An alibi, a
beard, a human canoe. She can sit on your back and paddle you up the
Thames…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Regrettably, we’ve had our last case
together. Those are my dates.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ve already read it. Luke Reordon, four
foot ten, red hair, missing two front teeth.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Case solved! You’re just not her type,
Holmes. She likes ginger dwarfs.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Midget!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: So you agree?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No, I don’t agree. It’s more than a
technicality. You’re misrepresenting the dimensions of foreshortened
people.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ve upset you, I can tell. I’ve said too
much.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No, I’m just saying, one has
disproportionate limbs the other does not.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Alright. What were you just doing?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Will you allow me to explain.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: That’s what I’ve been trying to do.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Why don’t I see myself out.</p>
<p><strong>man with roses</strong>: Got some roses for you, sweetheart.
Cut you a deal `cos you’re so pretty.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Oh, how nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>int. alley</strong>: The man with the roses beckons Irene
forward. Another man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
grab her –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn’t look like yours,
does it? And – naughty boy – here’s another one. I’ll return them, shall
I?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: These are lovely, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now, that’s the Irene I know.</p>
<p><strong>ext. london street</strong>: Holmes exits the alley, catches
a glimpse of Irene through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: This man intrigues me, Watson. He’s got
Adler on edge.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Which is no mean feat.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She’s intimidated, scared…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And yet she works for him. That’s bad money.
It’s nothing to do with me, but leave this case.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to
make a living. After all, I’ll be paying the rent entirely on my
own.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You know what, I’ve had just about enough
–</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Clarky!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mister Holmes, sir…?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Inspector Lestrade asks that you
come with me, at once.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What’s he done now, lost his way to Scotland
Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Us means you.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: It’s Lord Blackwood, sir. It
appears he’s come back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well that’s clever seeing as how I
pronounced him dead myself.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: A groundsman saw him walking
through the graves, just this morning.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ll leave this one in your capable hands. I
have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It is not my reputation at stake here.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Are you taking this seriously?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Like it or not, it’s a matter of
professional integrity. No girl wants to marry a doctor who can’t tell
if a man’s dead or not.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, you’d do well to hide your medical
certificates in case they’re revoked.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Look at this mess. Nothing but
standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have
been has been trampled.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Scotland Yard at their finest, once
again.</p>
<p><strong>42 continued: 42</strong>: Holmes offers Lestrade his
handkerchief, Lestrade waves it off.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Look at those slabs of marble – they’re
half a ton each if they’re a pound – smashed outward like they were
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Explain it if you can, Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And the coffin?</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: We’re digging it up now. The witness is
over there. You can question him if you like – but you won’t get
much.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: If you lot don’t stop behaving like a
bunch of superstitious milk maids, you’re on double-time! You’re an
embarrassment! Also, you’re forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not
a word. Are we bloody clear on that?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: He’s in shock. We should give him a few
moments.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: The witness stated that he saw Lord
Blackwood rise from the grave. Well? You pronounced the man dead.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: He had no pulse.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce
or a sycamore?</p>
<p><strong>42 continued: 42</strong>: But no one moves. The cops pass a
CROWBAR around as if it were red-hot. Watson’s had enough. He marches
forward –</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: That’s not Blackwood.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now that we have a firm grasp of the
obvious…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are
approximately – – three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death
at ten to twelve hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Inspector, may I see your pen?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Missing two incisors in the upper jaw…
Adler’s midget.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: All yours, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>42 continued: 42</strong>: Holmes and Watson begin walking
away from the crypt. Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the
dusty pocket watch.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Scratches around the keyhole where the watch
is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket
number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the
owner –</p>
<p><strong>groundskeeper</strong>: He was walking.</p>
<p><strong>groundskeeper</strong>: He was walking but his feet didn’t
touch the ground. And I’m not daft, I know what I saw and I know Lord
Blackwood. He was as alive as you or me. It’s not right. It’s not
natural. Our Father Who art in heaven…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now the game is afoot, Watson.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I fail to see how these fish and chips are
different from the three other places we passed along the way.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Just eat.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You know, I’ve seen things in war that I
couldn’t explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the
number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to
admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically
possible.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Never theorize before you have data.
Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts. Adler’s midget is the key to this.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hmm… scratches around the keyhole, what does
that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time
he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Very good, Watson! You’ve developed
considerable powers of your own.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let’s see now, there are several sets of
initials scored into the lid.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Pawnbroker’s marks.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The most recent is M.H…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Maddison and Haig.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us
an address.</p>
<p><strong>we see maddison &amp; haig, pawnbrokers,
respectable,</strong>: DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There’s one thing you’ve missed. On the
watch.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I think not.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The time. Which leads me to deduce that I’m
already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was
leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with
you.</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: Reckon your future, sir?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Perhaps we do need a little help from the
beyond.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: You need to hear what I have to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: I see two men, brothers. Not in blood
but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no… wait, a</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: I see madness. A man driven out of his
mind by a malign force.</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: I see a letter… the letter M… another
M… Mary? You will be married… I see… I see… Patterned table clothes,
china figurines, lace doilies…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You think you are clever don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: She turns to fat…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Do you have any changes?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: This is a new low – even for you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s the most honest prediction old Flora
has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely
the reason you can’t find a suitable ring. You’re terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Do you still have my cut from the fight?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why, do you –</p>
<p><strong>palm reader</strong>: I seen something in his hand. Darkness
and great pain. Mortal peril. Warn your friend, he’s not safe.</p>
<p><strong>ext. london east end - minutes later</strong>: Holmes and
Watson move down the street, the pawnshop behind them. Now Watson is
smiling, and Holmes is not. Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in
a box.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Not bad, eh?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Reordon’s lodgings should be right around
this bend. Here we are…</p>
<p><strong>52 continued: 52</strong>: He slows, looks up at a dark,
dingy LODGING HOUSE. Some windows are boarded up.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh,
well, give my regards to Mary.</p>
<p><strong>52 continued: 52</strong>: Holmes heads for lodging house.
Watson checks his watch.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I can spare ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>int. reordon’s rooms - day</strong>: The squalid doorway
opens into a series of dark rooms. Watson lights a lamp which reveals
details of an interior that stops them both in their tracks:</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He clearly felt something was coming to get
him.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Something did.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, come take a look at this –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Bloody hell…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ammonium sulfate.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Phosphorous… Formaldehyde… Hemlock…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Appears he was attempting to follow occult
formula with scientific practice.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Has he any hydrochloric acid?</p>
<p><strong>56 continued: 56</strong>: Holmes shuffles a few bottles,
tosses one to Watson. Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid,
another chemical on a clean sheet of paper.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Irene was here.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Why would she hire you to find him, if she
planned to do the job herself?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Maybe it’s not the man she’s after, but
something else. Something he was working on?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of
the ink. Long as it’s not too burnt…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: He worked for Blackwood.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There’s one odor I can’t put my finger on.
Sweet, almost like perfume… or sugar…. Barley sugar.</p>
<p><strong>58 continued: 58</strong>: They are followed by DREDGER, a
huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of
barley sugar .</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hello, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>dredger</strong>: Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Let me guess – you’re here to extinguish any
connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for?
Curious you’d still be running errands for a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>dredger</strong>: You do like to talk.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You take them, I’ll handle Mr. Sweet
tooth.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Seems about fair.</p>
<p><strong>int. reordon’s lab</strong>: Dredger bears down on Holmes.
Holmes reaches out for some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He
snatches a SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.</p>
<p><strong>58b int. reordon’s rooms 58b</strong>: Watson finishes off
his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as –</p>
<p><strong>58b continued: 58b</strong>: Watson spots the ring rolling
towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as –</p>
<p><strong>63 continued: 63</strong>: ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger’s
path, hitting him with the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!!
Holmes gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.</p>
<p><strong>ext. un-launched ship - slipway</strong>: A police WHISTLE
echoes through the air. Dredger turns for a moment, just long enough for
–</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>ext. second slipway - continuous action</strong>: We see the
chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the half-launched ship.</p>
<p><strong>66a continued: 66a</strong>: Nothing. No blood or trace. The
big man is gone.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I haven’t slept all night. I deserve this… I
clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could
meet Mary’s parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with
you. Now of course I’m in jail.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’re not implying that I am responsible
for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was
self- defense.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ve used the time to review my notes on our
exploits of the last seven months… and I’ve come to the conclusion that
I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Why else would I continually allow myself to
be led into situations where you’re deliberately withholding your
intentions from me?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’ve never complained about my methods
before.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m not complaining… I never complain… I
never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your
mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our
home on fire!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That was an accident…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The first time WAS an accident…</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: Remember me, boys? Put me away for robbery
a few years back?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most
dangerous man in London.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Who could forget that face? I told you, a
little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now,
if you’ll excuse us!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nor am I complaining about the fact that you
terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Gladstone’s my dog as well. It’s in the
interest of science.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What I do take issue with is your ruthless
campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, I completely understand now. You’re
overtired and feeling a bit sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What you need is a rest. You and I could go
out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near
Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could
throw a lamb on the spit.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: If I were going to the country, I would be
going with my future wife –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Certainly. We should have her along. Let’s
get Gladstone out of the house as well.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: No, Holmes. Not you. Me and her. You’re not
–</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Invited? Now you’re not making any sense,
Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother’s country home?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You’re not human. You don’t get it, do you?
You are this… … without this.</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: John Watson? You made bail.</p>
<p><strong>prison guard</strong>: Just Watson.</p>
<p><strong>int. london jail - corridor</strong>: Lestrade heads toward
the holding room, flanked by prison wardens.</p>
<p><strong>68 continued: 68</strong>: As the door is opened, the thug
blasts out backwards, having just been battered through it by
Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Lestrade – your usual impeccable timing.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: You know, in another life, you’d have made
an excellent criminal.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: And you, sir, an excellent policeman.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Tell me you have answers.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: All in good time.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: We don’t have time. I’ve an office full of
policemen hanging crosses over their desks. A public that’s working
itself into a frenzy…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Try to behave yourself. They just paid a
small fortune to bail you out.</p>
<p><strong>anonymous man</strong>: I’m afraid you’ll have to put this
on.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you
like this. I’m sure it’s quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I
am.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: As to where I am – I was, admittedly, lost
for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the
bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French
glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right,
a bump over the Fleet conduit – need I go on?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: As to who you are – that took every ounce of
my not- inconsiderable experience and skill… the letters on your desk
are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be
your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring,
you’re also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders – in whose
headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square.
And as to the mystery – the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me
in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Yes, well, it’s standard procedure, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: I think we have the right man.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish
from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: I suppose you already have some notion
as to the – practices of our Order?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes. They’re almost interesting.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Be as skeptical as you like – but our
secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for
centuries. The danger is that they can also be exploited for more
nefarious purposes.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: What some call the dark arts, or
practical magic.</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: We know you’re are a rationalist. We don’t
ask you to share our faith, only our fears.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Fear is the more infectious condition. In
this case, fear of your own child.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Blackwood is your son, yes? You have the
same colored irises – a rare dark green, with diamond- shaped hazel
flecks –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: – plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which
only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either
brothers, or, more likely, father and son.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Very few people are privy to that
information, and we want to keep it that way.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: He was conceived during one of our
rituals. His mother wasn’t my wife, but she shared our beliefs. She was
a powerful practitioner. Though not enough to survive giving birth to
him.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: We were young. It was before we fully
understood the powers we were dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Evidently.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: Death followed him wherever he went,
from his birth to arms he made and sold. What family he had tended to…
not survive. No one could prove anything of course, but we all knew
–</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: The boy was a curse. I didn’t have the
courage either to take him in or to –</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: All this is history. The present and
future are worse.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: We’ve done our best to stop him
ourselves, but it’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: His power grows daily and
exponentially. His resurrection is evidence of that. What he does next
will be far more dangerous –</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: – he’s going to raise a force that will
alter the very course of our world. We need you to find him and stop him
before he does.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: We’ll give you any assistance we can.
As Home Secretary, I have considerable influence over the police. Name
your price.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: One of the great benefits of my work is that
I can pick and choose my clients. I’ll get him, but not for you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I have one last question, Sir Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: If the rest of his family’s dead, why are
you still alive?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: If you’re going to watch me take my clothes
off, Sherlock, the least you can do is help me with the buttons.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: To watch a lady undress without her
permission is a criminal offense, Sherlock, and could get you into a lot
of trouble…</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: So why don’t you come over here and help me
instead.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You can stop looking for Reardon.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I knew I could count on you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He was buried in Blackwood’s tomb.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Wonderful. Case closed then. Your services
are no longer required.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I can’t help wondering if your employer will
be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at
ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I
couldn’t see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor
perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: The eye patch was a nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: But I’ve never known a professor to carry a
gun, and on such a clever contraption.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Let’s not argue.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’re not.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Tell me who you’re working for and what he’s
after.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That’s nobody’s business but my own.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I disagree.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You see, we are arguing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: When a man you ask me to find ends up dead
in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and
that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my
business, it’s the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of
the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to
be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this
magnitude would certainly mean prison time.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: This wine is excellent. You should really try
some.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: So what’s it to be?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Do we really have to decide now?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You’re in over your head this time,
Irene.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Much better.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: This is the only way it could ever work
between us, Sherlock – one in shackles, the other with the key.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ve NEVER been in over my head.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: How can you live like this – always a
fugitive.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: But free. And on my own terms. Just like you
– well, not you at this exact moment –</p>
<p><strong>75 continued: 75</strong>: She pulls at the front of his
trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: – but generally speaking.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: If anyone asks, please let them know that
Mr. O’Neil didn’t have time to check out. I hope you don’t mind settling
the bill.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What were you doing consorting with a married
business traveller in his hotel room is something you’ll have to explain
for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Where’s Watson when you need him?</p>
<p><strong>perigrine</strong>: Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey
with a nice glass of port? I’ve prepared a tray.</p>
<p><strong>sir thomas</strong>: No thank you, Perigrine, I’m going to
bed. You won’t let those figs go to waste, will you?</p>
<p><strong>perigrine</strong>: Nor the port, sir.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Hello, Father…</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You can’t fight it. It comes from a power
greater than yours. You can only surrender.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I’ve been imagining this moment for a
long time…</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: … I must admit, it’s better than I
thought it would be.</p>
<p><strong>int. the grand hotel - corridor - day</strong>: Carrying an
armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key into a lock and opens the
door…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t take this the wrong way, but might I
borrow your hand?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed.
Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: This is why I find this modern religious
fervor so troubling, there is no latitude for misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Faith runs riot over reason.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Well, it’s a good thing she was
offended or we’d never have found you. The inspector’s been over to
Baker Street himself this morning.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sir thomas’ house - day</strong>: Holmes steps out of
the coach, and is escorted inside by Constable Clark.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: We’ve checked everything. No sign
of a break-in. The Butler didn’t hear anything. The body was in the tub,
eyes wide open –</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: – only his ring was missing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why did you drain the water?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Out of common decency.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent
thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Uhhhh… jasmine?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger
cannister. It’ll either be in the pantry, high up where it’s warm and
dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check
the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks
without clay!</p>
<p><strong>78c continued: 78c</strong>: His eyes keep moving, noticing
something on a wall. He steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of
dust. The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.</p>
<p><strong>78c continued: 78c</strong>: FINGERPRINTS on one of the
panels.</p>
<p><strong>int. sir thomas’ bathroom</strong>: – Const. Clark and the
Officer return, the Officer proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE
BATH SALTS.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I have no idea what to make of that.
Excellent work.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Don’t forget the wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Figure of speech.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Since this room is no longer in use, do you
mind if I employ it?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Bring him in, boys.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Who was he?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My new roommate. He’s an inspiring
conversationalist.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No, he’s your friend from Reordon’s. He
didn’t survive Dredger landing on him. Poor fellow. But there is some
consolation in the knowledge that he can still be of service to his
fellow men.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Elbows and arms stained with blood, but
older than his own injuries. Plenty of it, layer on layer…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Though none of it human.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A butcher perhaps…? What else?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Hm – predominantly yellow flame, but with
distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around
industrial work and very little around a wash basin.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Coal… river silt…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That plus the river silt and industrial slag
on his trousers puts him squarely in…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nine Elms.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well done. Now, you didn’t happen to pack
the Lord’s Register of members’ interests, did you?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: See what Blackwood admits to owning.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s endless, he’s had a hand in just about
everything that’s not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Something brutal by the river…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Woolwich Arsenal… Limehouse Chemical…
Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That’s it, Watson! This should lead us right
to Blackwood.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Not us, you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Right. Well uh… best of luck with
everything, then.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Same to you.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Not again.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, I know. Don’t give me that look,
Gladstone.</p>
<p><strong>82a continued: 82a</strong>: A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle
down. He looks up, surprised by the rain. He raises his collar, and
keeps moving.</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: What’s the meaning of this? Why did you
call us here?</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: Sir Thomas is dead. Effective
immediately, I nominate Lord Blackwood as head of the Order.</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: Are you mad, Coward? Have you any idea
what he’s capable of?</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Of course he does. It’s why he’s
here.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I am humbled. I am honored. My powers and
my assets – munitions, shipping, industry – they were given to me for a
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: A magnificent and simple purpose. A
different future… a future ruled by us.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You’ve made policy in secret for
centuries. Now, you’ll make it openly.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: The first act is a necessary one, for
without death there can be no rebirth… … at noon tomorrow, we will take
the first step towards a new chapter in history. England will know our
power. Then, the whole world will. Across the Atlantic lies a colony
that was once ours, and will be again. Their civil war weakened them;
their government is as corrupt and ineffective as ours. We’ll take it
from them. With their resources and our power, we’ll remake the world,
we’ll create the future. Are you with me?</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: No, sir, we are not! The powers he’s
playing with are beyond any man’s control.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: They’re limitless – even death holds no
sway.</p>
<p><strong>standish</strong>: Help me stop him before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>83 continued: 83</strong>: In desperation, Standish pulls a
gun. But as he aims it at Blackwood -</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>int. temple of four orders headquarters</strong>: Blackwood
turns away from the window, surveys them. They are terrified, but they
are with him.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Come, drink your allegiance here.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You control the police. Use them.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Everything all right, Captain Tanner?</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Just a little leak, nothing to worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Not a great one for the water, are you,
doctor? Army type, aren’t you? You wouldn’t have lasted long in the
Navy.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: That’s as far as we can go.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There must be fifty yards of mud out
there.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the police
when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I know precisely how much money is in
there.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I am sure you do, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What are you doing with my gun?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It was an honest mistake –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There was nothing honest about it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Come on, let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>86 continued: 86</strong>: They look out at the thugs
guarding the door. Holmes whispers, trying to figure out the best
strategy.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The one on the left seems more attentive,
might prove easily distracted. The big one’s been drinking – whether for
courage or from habit… Watson?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: They cleared something out of here, not
minutes ago…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes. You need to see this.</p>
<p><strong>89 continued: 89</strong>: Holmes pulls out a CIGAR-CUTTER,
CLIPS off the rat’s TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins
Watson, stepping into –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: One-eighteen. It’s a date, a time?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s chapter and verse. Revelation 1:18. `I
am He that liveth, and was dead.’</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: `And behold, I am alive forevermore, and
have the keys of hell and of death. Amen.’</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I cautioned you to accept that this is
beyond your control. Now you see the truth for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I want you to bear witness. At noon
tomorrow, the world as you know it ends.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: And because I appreciate your help,
Holmes, I have a gift for you.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: She followed you. You led your little
lamb straight to slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>int. queenshithe slaughterhouse - assembly line</strong>:
Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to gear like
stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the conveyor, where Irene is
being pulled down the assembly line towards the flames.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It’s your turn in shackles this time.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: But this time no key, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’ve been meaning to ask you something –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Well, I’m a captive audience.</p>
<p><strong>90a continued: 90a</strong>: She’s suspended just above the
boiling water, with Holmes moving sideways, keeping pace with her.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You had a question.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain you’re not in
over your head?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: In some countries steam is considered
excellent therapy for the skin.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I have to say – it’s overrated.</p>
<p><strong>90a continued: 90a</strong>: – and Watson catches her feet,
pulls her horizontal, facing the other way just in time to avoid the
gush of boiling water.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Sherlock?</p>
<p><strong>90a continued: 90a</strong>: Gets a free haircut.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Thank you so much. I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You owe me information. No more games,
Irene.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Blackwood’s manufactured large- scale weapons
for years. Lately there’ve been rumors of something new. More powerful
than anything else. And… magical. My job is to find out if the rumors
are true.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I would say they are.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson!</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes…</p>
<p><strong>91 continued: 91</strong>: We see Lestrade and his men
swarming the scene, they spot Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has
disappeared. Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but –</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: There’s an order for your arrest
all the way from the top, sir – so you’ll have to hit me now.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: From Lord Coward?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Yes, sir, so make it look good.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you, Clarky.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - corridor</strong>: Two POLICEMEN
half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor. One reads the paper. The
headline: “AMERICAN AMBASSADOR</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: Watson is burned, cut, bruised,
scraped, pock-marked with shrapnel. He mumbles inaudibly, his eyes still
closed. He’s delirious, sweating.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What are you administering?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for the
pain.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: There are four pieces of shrapnel. The
surgeon should be along shortly.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They’re near the carotid artery.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Get a mirror, I’ll extract them myself.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I can’t authorize that, Doctor. We must
first manage the pain and combat the infection.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I haven’t time for that. My friend is in
dire –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Your friend? What kind of friend takes a
retired soldier, who’s served his country and deserves a peaceful,
private life, and puts him so directly in harm’s –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: The best and wisest man I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: But evidently not wise enough to value your
life over his misadventures.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It was worth a wound, worth many wounds…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I have other… patients.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you really? Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You have nothing more to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Um… I’ll check in on him again shortly.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is that the best you can do? I’m disappointed,
but not surprised.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If anything happens to him, both our lives are
lost. Do you understand that? Can you? –</p>
<p><strong>93 continued: 93</strong>: The Doctor can’t face her anger
any longer, turns, leaves fast.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: – or are you so selfish that’s just not
possible.</p>
<p><strong>95 continued: 95</strong>: Then he begins to chant. The words
are eerily reminiscent of Blackwood’s chanting.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: And now it dawns on you, you begin to
recognize your part in his play.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You see the path he chose for you.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Didn’t you wonder why it was so easy to
catch me? I told you I needed five lives for my resurrection. Why would
I take a sixth under St. Paul’s?</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Unless I simply wanted to be caught by
the great Sherlock Holmes…</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: … so I could die on the biggest stage of
all. You made me what I am.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson…?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Interesting artwork. You look bloody
awful.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What about the shrapnel in your arm?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Took it out myself. Mary said I had a lousy
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She brought you here?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Yes, oddly, it seems she might understand
the power of partnership.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The fair sex was always your department,
Watson.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you. You know, I dreamt that you were
strangling me.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I was… I had to get you to pass out to settle
down.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s half past nine.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Excellent brew, but I believe my head
requires something a bit stronger to clear the –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I brought you this…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Oh, I poisoned that one.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: With your own venom no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Better a snake than a lap dog.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There’s a new field in the treatment of
abnormal personalities – it’s called psychology. It appears you’re
what’s considered a para-neurotic deviant with anti-social proclivities.
Quite severe. And untreatable.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: No, doctor, I’m simply a woman.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Understand that, and you’ll have a happy
marriage.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Not quite, doctor. Let me make it simple for
you, with a lot fewer words – I’m what’s called a woman. Understand
that, and you’ll have a happy marriage.</p>
<p><strong>int. punch bowl pub</strong>: The music stops. Irene and
Watson notice the silence. They swap a glance. A beat. And Holmes
emerges.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I need a map of London.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now that you’re sitting comfortably, I shall
begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I
have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of
years of theological disparity. But that’s for another time. Blackwood’s
method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed
by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this
system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in
the crypt… with a few enhancements of my own.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: At minimum.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: My journey took me somewhat further down the
rabbit hole than I had intended.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Yes, your little white tail got rather
dirty.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: But I have emerged enlightened… The
fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the
Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to
another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power –</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the
Lion, the Eagle, and Man –</p>
<p><strong>102 continued: 102</strong>: He points out the individual
parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox
body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man’s face.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: In Sir Thomas’ secret chamber I found the
bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of
a man. Map!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Now, it is a widely held belief that within
the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this
system.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has
killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a
direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System. Reordon, the
ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore
the ox ring… he died here…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Standish was Ambassador to America, where
the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years – and
not by coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The headquarters of Temple of the Four
Orders where he died is here…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Man, Ox, Eagle…</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: And last on the list: the Lion.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Correspondingly, the map will tell us the
location of Blackwood’s final act. Right here.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Parliament.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What is the meaning of this circle?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: It is the fifth element – the ethereal. That
which can’t yet be known.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: It’s right in the middle of the River
Thames.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Police.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Ladies first.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Follow these plans.</p>
<p><strong>int. punch bowl pub - hall</strong>: Holmes races down the
hall toward the back door, but the door EXPLODES inward. Police fill the
hall. Holmes looks back, where more police block his path. He simply
raises his arms, and they drag him away.</p>
<p><strong>104 continued: 104</strong>: The carriage pulls up. Crowds
are gathering outside, hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and
enthusiasm. Holmes sees the hands of BIG BEN, climbing toward noon.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: Lestrade?</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Begging your pardon, m’lord, I know it’s
unorthodox, but Mr. Holmes has been making serious accusations about you
and the order, sir.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how
you became inspector.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: I have five minutes before my next
engagement, why don’t you regale me with your stories of conspiracies.
Thank you, Lestrade, if you could wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’m curious, Coward, did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented? Very
distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is
the unique imprint they leave.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Nonetheless, I confess to being completely
out-matched. I could deduce very little from my investigation.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Fortunately, there is nothing more
stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many
members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today? Man, ox,
eagle, lion – the lion is parliament, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: Very clever. But it’s not murder,
Mr. Holmes. It’s mercy. We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd.
Don’t you see it’s for their own good?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No, but I don’t care much what you think. I
simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood’s final ceremony, and
now you have given it to me.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: I have told you nothing.</p>
<p><strong>106 continued: 106</strong>: A pair of handcuffs, slide
across the floor to Coward’s feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to
be found. Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>series of flashbacks</strong>: Coward’s heel walking through
mud.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A touch of red stock brick dust on your
knee, from where you’ve been kneeling…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A small bandage on your thumb from where
you’ve been vowing…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A faint aroma of excrement, from where you
have been standing.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: It’s a shame you made an enemy out of
Blackwood, Holmes, you would have made a valuable ally. The powers at
our disposal are far greater than you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You and Blackwood laid the final touches to
your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour
ago.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Both Houses met today. The entire government
will be present.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: How terrible is wisdom, Holmes, when it
brings no profit to the wise. We take power at noon.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Well there’s no time to waste then, is
there?</p>
<p><strong>ext. thames - outside parliament</strong>: SPLASH! Holmes
dives into the river handcuffed. He disappears for a moment then
surfaces, looks about in the water. A moment of concern until we hear
the familiar “chug” of a struggling engine.</p>
<p><strong>107 continued: 107</strong>: Holmes looks in the water and
sees a rope trailing on the surface. He grabs it with his hands. And… it
pulls him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: I told you he’d be coming out the top
window, soldier boy. No way he’d be coming over the terrace.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How was Lestrade?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Performed his role perfectly. A little too
perfectly, come to think of it.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well, your instructions were fairly precise…
about everything except the window.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Where to, Sherlock?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Port side, Captain Tanner, into the
sewers.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Watson, did you bring my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>107 continued: 107</strong>: Then Holmes reaches inside a
pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that
he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Starting early, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Trust me, have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: What are we doing in the sewers?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Patience, Doctor. I am about to show
you…</p>
<p><strong>ext. houses of parliament - day</strong>: Expensive carriages
fill the courtyard. The entire government is here. We see familiar faces
from the Temple of Four Orders, heading into this epic building.</p>
<p><strong>tanner</strong>: Far as I can go.</p>
<p><strong>110 continued: 110</strong>: Holmes ducks around a corner,
stops. Irene and Watson flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a
long tunnel to:</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Behold, Blackwood’s magic.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: A chemical weapon. The first of its kind.
Cyanide, to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You can tell that from here?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: No. I can tell it from here.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at
the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of
bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That shaft leads directly to Parliament.
When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge
converting the cyanide powder into a gas.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: All of the people inside that building –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Will be dead at the strike of noon.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: As if by magic. There will be no one left to
stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Seven minutes to twelve…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’ll keep these under wraps.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Take this.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There’s never been anything like it. A
totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device
sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite –</p>
<p><strong>112 continued: 112</strong>: Irene shoots one point blank
with her Derringer, Holmes crushes the other’s larynx.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Keep at it.</p>
<p><strong>lord coward</strong>: Look.</p>
<p><strong>int. sewers - day</strong>: The chime echoes. Dredger charges
towards the device and Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first,
deflecting him for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Nine strokes left.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: You owe me for the ring.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>114 continued: 114</strong>: – which shatters against the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>int. sewer tunnel - day</strong>: Holmes rips the stem off
his pipe, places the open end of the bowl against the bolt holding the
cylinders in place. Shaped charge, Victorian-style.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We need a light, a match –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Got it…</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Two!</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You seem surprised. Did you really take
me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? I see
before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of
their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become
nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world’s stage
seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your
britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit
idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you
drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and
filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all
this.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I am the fourth horseman.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I am the pale rider.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: And my name to you is death.</p>
<p><strong>int. sewer tunnels - day</strong>: ZZZZP! The electrical
charge zaps through the device, electrodes sizzle, sending blinding
sparks through the cradle.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That was something new for us.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes… it was.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Watson –</p>
<p><strong>118 continued: 118</strong>: Holmes whips around – sees
Watson, seemingly dead. He goes to him, drops to his knees next to
Watson, feels for a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’m pretty sure I heard the last chime.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Yes, we made it. Just.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Come on, you’ve got to admit, you’re going
to miss this.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Which part? The stench of the sewers or the
broken bones? My ankle’s done.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Where’s Irene?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Holmes, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact.</p>
<p><strong>int. houses of parliament - day</strong>: Blackwood flashes
downward through the ornate official understory of the Houses, heads for
a staircase spiralling even further down.</p>
<p><strong>int. single sewer tunnel - day</strong>: Panting, Irene runs
along a tunnel that steps lower –</p>
<p><strong>int. hollow building - day</strong>: Irene emerges at the
base of a dark, hollow building full of construction equipment, and
sees, yes –</p>
<p><strong>118i int. cellar - day 118i</strong>: – just as Holmes pops
out of the pipe, vaults onto the fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger
lends him energy.</p>
<p><strong>sherlock</strong>: Woman!</p>
<p><strong>sherlock</strong>: It’s bad manners to leave without at least
saying `goodbye.’</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You of all people know I will pull this
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’d tell you I’m sorry, that I wish things
could be different but you wouldn’t believe me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Why hurry off, give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: You’re better off without her,
Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: I planned to kill a handful of senile old
men to make this empire strong… but now because of you thousands are
going to die.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: All I have to do is break this cylinder.
The wind will do the rest. And you’ll be the first.</p>
<p><strong>119h continued: 119h</strong>: Blackwood is DRAGGED down the
walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There was never any magic. Only conjuring
tricks.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The simplest involved paying people off,
like the prison guard…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Who pretended to be possessed outside your
cell. Your reputation and your jailers’ fear did the rest. Others
required more elaborate preparation, like the sandstone slab that
covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back
together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe – a
mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the rain or
eaten by animals. Arranging for your father to drown in his own bathtub
required more modern science. Very clever of Reordon to find a paralytic
that was activated by the combination of copper and water and was
therefore undetectable once the bath water was drained.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: That might have been quite challenging had
he not also tested it on some unfortunate amphibians. The death of
Standish was a real mystery, until you used the same compound to blow up
the wharf. An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid – yet it burned with
an unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish mistake it for rain as he entered
your Temple? All it took was a spark. A simple rigged bullet in his gun.
Ingenious. Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance
for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have
watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn’t
know that you had given them the antidote – at one of your ceremonies I
suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you
harnessed the ultimate power.</p>
<p><strong>119h continued: 119h</strong>: Blackwood struggles to hold
on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the
precipice. Wind whips harder.</p>
<p>****: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a faint musical
note moving up the same pentatonic scale</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You hated your father and the other members
of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How
satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.</p>
<p><strong>in b.g.</strong>: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes
continue to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a rope.
The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings, strikes another
crane…</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: Cut me loose, Holmes!</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: You better hope that it’s nothing more than
superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: First, the world will see you for what you
are. Then you will hang… properly this time.</p>
<p><strong>blackwood</strong>: We’ll see about that shall we. It’s a
long journey from here to the rope.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’ll see about that shall we.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Oh, Irene…</p>
<p><strong>119h continued: 119h</strong>: Her eyes pop open.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: It looks like rain.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: We’ve still got a moment.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You were right, he is a professor. Moriarty.
Key’s in the watch pocket.</p>
<p><strong>119h continued: 119h</strong>: Holmes reaches over to grab
the key. Their faces close, near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the
top of her shirt . He snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns
and walks away. She smiles, calls out:</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You’ll miss me, Sherlock.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Sadly, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: It’ll be a hell of a trick if Blackwood
comes back from this one.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Thank you, Lestrade.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: Now you’re going to be even more arrogant
and insufferable than ever.</p>
<p><strong>lestrade</strong>: You’re welcome, detective. Is the woman up
there?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: She won’t be by the time your boys get
there.</p>
<p><strong>122a continued: 122a</strong>: A shadow is waiting for him.
We recognize the figure of WATSON. Holmes can’t help but smile. He joins
Watson, no words spoken.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: One moment.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Please make sure this one is put on the desk
in the front room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s in all those notebooks?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Nothing really… Just a few scribbles… cases
we’ve worked on over the years.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: All your adventures… I’d love to read them
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>int. 221 baker st. - staircase</strong>: As Watson and Mary
climb the stairs, it becomes clear that Mary now wears IRENE’S DIAMOND
on her finger. Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I still can’t believe he’s given us that
ring.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you think he’s finally come to terms with
you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Of course. No question about it –</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Don’t panic, dear.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Suicide is not in his repetoire, he’s far
too fond of himself.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Good afternoon. I was trying to deduce the
manner in which Blackwood survived his execution. Clearing your good
name, as it were. But it had a surprisingly soporific effect and I was
carried off in the arms of Morpheus, like a caterpillar in a cocoon.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Get on with it, Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Cleverly concealed in the hangman’s knot was
a hook – I believe my legs have fallen asleep. I should probably come
down.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Shouldn’t you help him, John?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I hate to stop when he’s on a roll. Do carry
on, Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The executioner attached it to a harness,
thus allowing the weight to be distributed around the waist and the neck
to remain intact. My lord, I can’t feel my cheeks. Might we continue
this at ground level?</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: How did you manage it, Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I managed it with braces, belts and a coat
hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I’ll be of no use to you
at all.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Worse things could happen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: But none of this explains the lack of a
pulse.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: There is a toxin refined from the nectar of
the rhododendron ponticum. It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea for its ability to induce an apparently mortal
paralysis. Enough to mislead a medical mind even as tenacious and
well-trained as your own. It is known locally as –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What’s wrong with Gladstone?</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: – mad honey disease.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: He is demonstrating the very effect I’ve
just described. He doesn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: His heart should be ticking in no time.</p>
<p><strong>123b continued: 123b</strong>: Watson feels for a pulse in
his dog’s neck – he shakes his head. They are interrupted by a knock on
the door. Constable Clark enters.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Mr. Holmes… Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me, right away.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: What is it this time, Clarky?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: It’s one of our sergeants, sir. He
went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood… Well, a
maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was
our first man on the scene. Shot in the head.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Point blank range.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: With small caliber bullet.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Moriarty.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s a brave boy… There, there,
everything’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Where is Blackwood’s device now?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: The secret service has it, sir.
They’ve taken over the case.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’d wager there’s a piece missing.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: So you’re saying Moriarty was after a part
of the machine and not the poison.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: The wire-free invention was the game all
along. Imagine being able to control any device simply by sending a
command via radio waves.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Adler was just a diversion.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I’ve loaded the last of your boxes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’ll leave with you. Clarky, case
reopened.</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: We believe Sergeant Smith was the
first officer there.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Oi, what you doing?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: Shot in the head.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: He was shot at point-blank
range.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: There’s a brave boy… There, there,
everything’s going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Where is Blackwood’s device now?</p>
<p><strong>constable clark</strong>: The secret service has it, sir.
They’ve taken over the case.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: I’d wager there’s a piece missing.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Wager, Watson… I thought those days were
behind you. Excellent deduction, however.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - the policeman</strong>: removes a small
receiver-like object from Blackwood’s device.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Moriarty was after the machine not the
poison.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Blackwood’s wire-free invention was the game
all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of
the two… Irene was just a diversion.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ve loaded the last of your boxes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: I’ll walk out with you…</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: An honor working with you, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>watson</strong>: Take care of yourself, Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Try not to be too late for dinner with my
parents and… be careful.</p>
<p><strong>holmes</strong>: Magnificent woman, Watson. Magnificent!</p>
