<p><strong>voice</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You okay, Tina?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Just a dream, Ma… Damn dream, is all…</p>
<p><strong>tina’s mother</strong>: Some dream, judging from that.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You coming back to the sack or what?</p>
<p><strong>tina’s mother</strong>: Hold your horses. You gotta cut your
nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina. One or the other.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you… Three
four better lock your door Five six grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>rope jumpers</strong>: Seven eight, gonna stay up late! Nine
ten – never sleep again!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That’s what it reminded me of – that old jump
rope song. Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night
myself…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina.
Had your name written all over it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There’s four letters in my name, Rod. How
could there be room on your joint for four letters?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Rod says the sweetest things.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s nuts about you.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah, nuts.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Anyway, I’m too tired to worry about the
creep. Couldn’t get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Forget it, the point is, everybody has
nightmares once in a while. No biggy.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Next time you have one, just tell yourself
that’s just all it is, right while you’re having it, y’know? That’s the
trick. Once you do that, you wake right up. At least it works for
me.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hey! You have a nightmare too?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Maybe we’re gonna have the Big Earthquake.
They say things get weird just before that…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I can’t believe his mother let him come over
here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right. Well, she didn’t, exactly…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: See, I got this cousin who lives near the
airport, that it’s okay for me to stay with, right? So I found this
sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Hello, Mom? Yeah, out here at Barry’s.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual. Glad we don’t live
here – huh? Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Right, right – I’ll call you in the morning!
Right! Huh? Yeah, sure, I, huh?…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Uh… some kid’s drag racing outside, I
think…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Listen, Mom, I got to go – I think there’s
been an accident out front – I –</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Right. I’ll call the police. No, just some
neighbors having a fight, I guess. I’m fine, I’m fine! Call you in the
morning!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Worked like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nice to have a fire.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Really. Turn ’er up a little.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over
too. He might get jealous.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Rod and I are done. He’s too much of a
maniac.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: He should join the Marines, they could make
something out of him. Like a hand grenade.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: See? You’ve forgotten the bad dream. Didn’t I
tell you?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: All day long I been seeing that guy’s weird
face, and hearing those fingernails…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fingernails? That’s amazing, you saying that.
It made me remember the dream I had last night.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What you dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and
yellow sweater; I dream in color, y’know; he walked into the room I was
in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and
just stared at me. Sort of… obscenely. Then he walked out through the
wall on the other side. Like he’d just come to check me out…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: So what about the fingernails?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He scraped his fingernails along things –
actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he’d made
them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose –
sssssccrrrtttt….</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy. You dreamed about the same creep I did,
Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There’s somebody out there, isn’t there…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I didn’t hear anything…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I’m gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever
you are.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: It’s just a stupid cat.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Anyway, I don’t have a cat…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Kitty-kitty? Chow chow chow?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: And it’s number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing
Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle! And
the fans go wild!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What the hell you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Of course. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Intense, huh? So what’s happening, an orgy or
something?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: – Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and
me. Glen was just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You see his face? Your ma ain’t home, is she?
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: We got her mother’s bed. You two got the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We should get her out of here…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hey – you guys’re hanging around – right?
Don’t leave me alone with this lunatic – Pleeeeze, NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: So we’ll guard her together. Through the
night. In each others’ arms like we always said.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen. Not now. I mean, we’re here for Tina
now, not for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Why’s she so bothered by a stupid nightmare,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Because he was scary, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who was scary?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t you think it’s weird, her and me
dreaming about the same guy? You didn’t have a bad dream last night, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me? I don’t dream.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Morality sucks.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I knew there was something about you I
liked…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You feel better now, right?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Jungle man fix Jane.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: No more fights?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No more fights.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Good. No more nightmares for either of us
then.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: When did you have a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Guys can have nightmares too, y’know. You ain’t
got a corner on the fucking market or something.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Where’d you get this snotty old thing?</p>
<p><strong>angle back up on the ceiling just above her head.
something</strong>: presses against the surface from the inside. The
plaster bulges out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing
pressing from inside – taking the shape of a man’s face. The face opens
its mouth. The knives rake through the surface.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: ROD…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Who the fuck you think you are, whoever you
are?</p>
<p><strong>wide angle on the rear of the house. a light comes on.
tina</strong>: appears in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Somebody there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tina.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Oh, shit, please God…</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: This is God…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy! Open the door – Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She’s still awake. Nancy can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: T-tina!?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: What the hell’s going ON here! Tina!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Tina –</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You motherfucker! I’ll kill you for that!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What the hell’s going on!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh – jeez – Glen! Rod’s gone ape!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Rod? Rod, you better not hurt Tina…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. Something slippery all over here…
Tina?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I… I’m gonna call the cops –</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but
–</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I’d’ve canned your ass if you hadn’t.
What you got?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Her name was Tina Gray. It was her home.
Father abandoned ten years ago, mother’s in Vegas with a boyfriend.
We’re trying to reach her now.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What’s the Coroner got to say?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Something like a razor was the weapon, but
nothing found on the scene.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: Lieutenant. You know who –</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: I put her in your office…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane.
Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope –</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Terrific. What the hell was she doing
there?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: She lived there.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I don’t mean her –</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I mean you. What the hell was she doing
there?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hello to you, too, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Marge.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How you doing, pal?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay. Hi, dad.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I don’t want to get into this now, God
knows you need time. But I’d sure would like to know what the hell you
were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night –
especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod’s not a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: You got a sane explanation for what he
did?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said
they’d had a fight, Rod and Tina.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It wasn’t that serious…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Maybe you don’t think murder’s serious –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She was my best friend! Don’t you dare say I
don’t take her death seriously! I just meant their fights weren’t that
serious.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She dreamed this would happen…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She had a nightmare about somebody trying to
kill her, last night. That’s why we were there; she was afraid to sleep
alone.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She’s been through enough for one night. You
have her statement.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I suggest you keep a little better
track on her – she’s still a kid, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You think I knew there were boys there!? You
try raising a teenager alone.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: See they get home okay.</p>
<p><strong>tv newscaster</strong>: In the headlines this morning – a
local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all-night party.</p>
<p><strong>tv newscaster</strong>: Police say the victim, fifteen-year-
old Christina Grey, had quarreled earlier with her boyfriend, Rod Lane,
a punk rocker with a history of delinquency. Lane is now the subject of
a city-wide manhunt. According to –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: School.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I could hear you tossing and turning all
night, kiddo. You’ve no business going to school.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I gotta go to school, Mom. Please. Otherwise
I’ll just sit up there and go crazy or something.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ll sleep in study hall, promise. I’d rather
keep busy, you know?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Right home after.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right home after. See you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Your old man thinks I did it, don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He doesn’t know you. Couldn’t you change?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: The cops were all over my house. They’ll kill
me for sure.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nobody’s gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I never touched her.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You were screaming like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Someone else was there.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The door was locked from your side.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Don’t look at me like I’m some kind of fucking
fruitcake or something, I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Morning, Mr. Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Now just step away from her, son. Like
your ass depended on it. I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Jesus – are you crazy!?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I didn’t do it – ! I didn’t kill her,
Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You used me, daddy!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What the hell you doing going to school
today, anyway – your mother told me you didn’t even sleep last
night!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Nancy! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: According to Shakespeare, there was
something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that
was rotten – a canker, as he put it.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Of course Hamlet’s response to this, and to
his mother’s lies, was to continually probe and dig – just like the
gravediggers – always trying to get beneath the surface. The same was
true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Jon, go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: Uh, In the most high and palmy state of
Rome…</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy student</strong>: California’s the most high and
palmy state, man.</p>
<p><strong>english teacher</strong>: Can it.</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a
little ere the mightiest Julius fell… The graves stood tenantless, and
the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad
dreams…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Tina!</p>
<p><strong>hallguard</strong>: Y-you’re not supposed to run. W- where’s
your pass – you got a pass?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Screw your stupid pass!</p>
<p><strong>hallguard</strong>: Hey, no running in the halls!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Tina?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gonna get you.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Okay – Okay, Thompson! Everything’s all
right now – Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’ll call your mother.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No! No, really, I’m fine. I’ll go straight
home. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: You’ll need a hall pass!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Couldn’t get back to sleep at all. What you
dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My dad here?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Decide to take a day off after all?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Only family allowed, Nancy. You know
the drill.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just want to talk to him a second.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: He’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You don’t know he did it.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: No, I know, thanks to your own
testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive
and came out in a rubber bag.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I just want to talk to him. Please, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I told you. It was dark, but I’m sure there was
someone else IN there, under the covers with her.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How could somebody get under the covers with
you guys without you knowing it?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: How the fuck do I know? I don’t expect you to
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What he look like? You get a look at him?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Well then how can you say somebody else was
there?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Because somebody cut her. While I watched.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Somebody cut her while you watched and you
don’t know what he looked like?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You couldn’t see the fucker. You could just see
the cuts happening, all at once.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What you mean ‘all at once’?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I mean, it was as if there were four razors
cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just… opened
up…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I probably could’ve saved her if I’d moved
sooner… But I thought it was just another nightmare, like the one I had
the night before. There… was this guy who had knives for fingers…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Do you think I did it?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy, don’t fall asleep in there.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Get into bed.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You’re not falling asleep, are you? You could
drown, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mother, for petesakes.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It happens all the time. I’ve got some warm
milk all ready for you. Why don’t you jump into bed? I’m gonna turn on
your electric blanket, too. C’mon, now.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Warm milk. Gross.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: One, two, Freddie’s coming for you, three
four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight
gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy! NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I told you! Hundreds of people a year drown
like that!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Great</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: To bed with you, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No television, forget the homework, no phone
calls.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: And no school tomorrow, either. You take a
little vacation, relax and rest for a change.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yes, Mother. G’night.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Take this, it’ll help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sleep tight, don’t let the bedbugs bite.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Sorry! Saw your light on. Thought I’d see how
you were.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Sometimes I wish you didn’t live right across
the street.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a
rose trellis in your bare feet?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: If you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: So. I heard you freaked out in English class
today.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Haven’t slept, have you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You look dead and rained on, if you want the
ugly truth. And what did you do to your arm?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Burned myself in English class.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: M’god, I look twenty years old. You have any
weird dreams last night?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Slept like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Well at least I have an objective wall to
bounce this off. You believe it’s possible to dream about what’s going
to happen?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe in the Boogey Man?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you? No. Rod
killed Tina. He’s a fruitcake and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe in anything?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And
I’m not too sure about you lately.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s nothing too hard or anything. I’m just
going to… LOOK for someone, and… I want you to be sort of a… guard.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Okay, okay. I think.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You won’t screw up, right? I mean, a whole
lot might depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Okay, I won’t screw up.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Jesus, it’s dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Shhh. Now listen, here’s what we’re gonna
do…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You still there?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just checking – keep out of sight!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Still there?</p>
<p><strong>glen’s voice</strong>: Still here!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: On your toes, right?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen?!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: GLEN!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I swear…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen, where are you! Wake up! Glen!</p>
<p><strong>deep ragged voice</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen! Glen!!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glennn!!!</p>
<p><strong>angle at floor level – close on nancy’s and the
killer’s</strong>: HEADS. The blades inch towards the girl’s face – the
drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarred face spills into
her eyes. Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen, you bastard…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What I do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay
awake and watch me – Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad
dream. But you. You shit – what do you do – you fall asleep!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I must be going nuts…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yes, mother?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. Just had a little dream. I’m falling
right back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Okay… You need anything, just call.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You mind telling me what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, I see. That makes it all perfectly
clear.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: I thought when I took the night shift
I’d have peace and quiet for a change.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s urgent, we’ve gotta see Rod.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: It’s three in the morning. Your mother
know you’re out this late?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Of course – look, at least go back and look
at him. Just see if he’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: We have reason to think there might be
something weird going on.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Oh, no argument on that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dad – what you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: It so happens I work here, and there’s
an unsolved murder. I don’t like unsolved murders, especially ones my
daughter’s mixed up in – what are you doing here at this hour? You’re
supposed to be getting some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a
nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she
thinks…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I just want to see if he’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Take my word for it, Nancy. The guy’s
sleeping like a baby. He’s not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: This isn’t your average nightmare, Daddy –
damn it!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Now look, Nancy, don’t push it. You’ve
already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence – don’t start throwing
in insanity!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just go back and check – please!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Okay, Garcia. What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Right… Now where’d I put the key…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Gimme a hand, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Goddamn loco kid – he didn’t have t’do
that – Madre dios!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How’d you know he was gonna do
this?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be
with this young man’s soul.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: His life and his death attest to the
Scripture’s warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the
sword.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: But let us recall also our Lord’s
admonition that we ‘Judge not, lest we be judged.’ Let us attempt only
to love. And may Rod Lane rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Amen to that much.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How’s Nancy doing?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t think she’s slept since Tina died.
She’s always been a delicate kid.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: She’s tougher than you think. Any idea
how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No. All I know is, this reminds me too much
of ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Yeah. Well… Let’s not start digging up
bodies just because we’re in a cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Time to go home, baby.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The killer’s still loose, you know.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: You saying somebody else killed Tina?
Who?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t know who he is. But he’s burned, he
wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses
some sort of knifes he’s got made into a sort of… glove. Like giant
fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I think you should keep Nancy at home a
few days. ’Til she’s really over the shock.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I got something better… I’m gonna get you
help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more.</p>
<p><strong>ucla school of medicine</strong>: INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF
SLEEP DISORDERS</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But I just don’t feel… ready to sleep yet.
Please, do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Don’t worry, you’re not gonna change into
Bride of Frankenstein or anything.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses?
Scarlet Fever? High temperatures – concussions?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He means, did you ever drop me on my
head.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Nightmares are expected after psychological
trauma. Don’t worry, they go away.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I sure as hell hope so.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t see why you couldn’t just give me a
pill to keep me from dreaming…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Everyone’s got to dream. If you don’t
dream, you go… All set?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They’re just simple tests, Nan. We’ll both be
right here.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Look, I know it’s been frightening, I know
your dreams have seemed real. But… it’s okay. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Please, Nancy. Trust us.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s not you I don’t trust. It’s… Okay. Let’s
do it.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: How long’s this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Since the murder. She was fine before
that.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Not to worry. No signs of pathology in
Nancy’s EEG or pulse rate. I’d guess what we’ve got is a normal young
girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It’s just made her think… her dreams are
real…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Ever hear the old Buddhist tale about the
King who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, good. She’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What the hell are dreams, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus.
Truth is we still don’t know what they are or where they come from. As
for nightmares… Did you know that in the last three years twenty
Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not
from heart attacks, either. They just died.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What happened? That needle sank like a
rock.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: She’s entering deep sleep now. Heart rate’s
a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she’s nicely relaxed. All
normal. She could dream at any time now. Right now she’s like a diver on
the bottom of an ocean no one’s mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows
up.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, she’s started to dream.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: R.E.M.’s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes
follow the dream – their movement picks up on this –</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Beta Waves are slowing, too. She’s
dreaming, all right. A good one, too.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Typical dream parameter. A nightmare, now,
would be plus or minus five or six; she’s just around three point –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What the hell’s this? She awake or
asleep?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Can’t be. It never gets this high…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: NANCY!!! IT’S MOM – NANCY!!!!</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Now, this is just going to let you relax
and sleep, Nan –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No. That’s enough sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, kid. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh my god, oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Get the kit!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe this?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where the hell did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I grabbed it off his head.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She said she snatched it off his head in a
dream. No, I’m not crazy, I’ve got the damn thing in my hand! I know we
did, we all… Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You didn’t sleep, did you? The doctor says
you have to sleep or you’ll –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Go even crazier?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t think you’re going crazy – and stop
drinking that damn coffee!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Did you ask Daddy to have the hat
examined?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I threw that filthy thing away – I don’t know
what you’re trying to prove with it, but –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What I learned at the dream clinic, that’s
what I’m trying to prove. Rod didn’t kill Tina, and he didn’t hang
himself. It’s this guy – he’s after us in our dreams.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: But that’s just not reality, Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s real, Mamma. Feel it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Put that damned thing down!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: His name is even in it – written right in
here – Fred Krueger – Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mamma? You
better tell me, cause now he’s after me!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy, trust your mother for once – you’ll
feel better as soon as you sleep!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You call this feeling better? Or should I
grab a bottle and veg out with you – avoid everything happening to me by
just getting good and loaded –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Fred Krueger can’t be after you, Nancy – he’s
dead!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Fred Krueger is dead. Dead and gone. Believe
me, I know. Now go to bed. I order you, go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You knew about him all this time, and you’ve
been acting like he was someone I made up!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You’re sick, Nancy. Imagining things. You
need to sleep, it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Screw sleep!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy – it’s only a nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Whenever I get nervous I eat.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And if you can’t do that, you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Used to. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You ever read about the Balinese way of
dreaming?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: They got a whole system they call ‘dream
skills’. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling,
right?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you
say, okay, I’m gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world
where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all
their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream
skills.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And what if they meet a monster in their
dream? Then what?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: They turn their back on it. Takes away its
energy, and it disappears.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What happens if they don’t do that?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I guess those people don’t wake up to tell
what happens.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: ‘Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel
Devices’!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore
on Ventura.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Well what you reading it for?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m into survival.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: She’s starting to scare the living shit out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: And the other…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where’s your mask and gun?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Don’t bust my chops, lady. If the city
found out I put ’em in without inside releases I’d loose my license.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh gross…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mom, what’s with the bars!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh, Mom…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: ’S’mine…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What’s with the bars?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: S’curity.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred
Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Dead and gone.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I want to know how, where – if you don’t tell
me, I’m going to call daddy.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Your father the cop. That’s a good one.
Forget Fred Krueger. You don’t want to know, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I do want to know. He’s not dead and gone –
he’s after me and if I sleep he’ll get me! I’ve got to know!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You want to know who Fred Krueger was? He was
a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area,
kids we all knew. It drove us all crazy when we didn’t know who was
doing it – but it was even worse when they caught him.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous,
but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and
Fred Krueger was free, just like that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: So he’s alive?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: He wouldn’ve stopped. The bastard would’ve
got more kids first chance he got – they found nearly ten bodies in his
boiler room as it was. But the law couldn’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What was needed were some private citizens
willing to do what had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What did you do, mother?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Bunch of us parents tracked him down after
they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw
him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore,
drunk an’ asleep with his weird knives by his side…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: We poured gasoline all around the place, left
a trail out the door, locked the door, then…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: WHOOSH!!!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: But just when it seemed not even the devil
could live in there any more – he crashed out like a banshee, all on
fire – swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming
he… he was going to get us by killing all our kids…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: There were all those men, Nancy, even your
father, oh yes, even him. But none could do what had to be done –
Krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear – no
one could take your father’s gun and kill him good and proper except
me.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So he’s dead Nan. He can’t get you. Mommy
killed him.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who was there? Were Tina’s parents there?
Were Rod’s?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sure, and Glen’s. All of us. But that’s in
the past now, baby. Really. It’s over. We even took his knives.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: All these years you’ve kept those things
buried down here? In our own house?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Proof he’s declawed. As for him, we buried
him good and deep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So’s okay, you can sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh. Hi, how y’doing?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fine. Stand by your window so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Much better.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I heard your ma went ape at the security store
today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long’s it
been since you slept?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Coming up on the seventh day. It’s okay, I
checked Guiness. The record’s eleven, and I’ll beat that if I have to.
Listen, I… I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The killer.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, and if he gets me, I’m pretty sure
you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t ask – just give me some help nailing
this guy when I bring him out.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Bring him out of what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My dream.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: How you plan to do that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the
sucker when you wake me up.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me? Wait a minute, you can’t bring someone out
of a dream!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: If I can’t, then you all can relax, because
it’ll just be a simple case of me being nuts.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I can save you the trouble. You’re nutty as a
fruitcake. I love you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Good, then you won’t mind cold-cocking this
guy when I bring him out.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You heard me. I grab him in the dream – you
see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the
fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You crazy? Hit him with what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You’re a jock. You must have a baseball bat
or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Meanwhile…?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Meanwhile whatever you do don’t fall asleep.
Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Holy shit! Midnight. Baseball bats and
boogemen. Unfucking real.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lieutenant Thompson – what you doing in at this
time?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Can’t sleep, thought I’d come break up
the poker game.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: If it was any more quiet we could
hear owls farting.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Is quiet, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: How’s your girl?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: She’s sensible. She’ll sleep sooner or
later.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: You’d think they’d have something ’bout
the Lane kid hanging himself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Maybe we’re all making more out of it
than we should.</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: I wouldn’t touch that line with a ten foot
pole.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Glen? You all right?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Glen honey?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Whuu?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: How can you listen to Carson and a record
at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Wasn’t listening to the tube, just watching.
Miss Nude America’s supposed to be on tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Well how you gonna hear what she
says?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who cares what she says?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: You should get to sleep soon, Glen. It’s
almost midnight. Goodness knows we’ve all had enough of a time the last
few days…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I will, Mom… in a while. You guys turning
in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: We’ll go away, take a vacation. Get your hair
colored nice, the way it was. No one will ever know. This whole room
smells of coffee, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It’s all over now, baby. The nightmare’s
over. Please.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Night-night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Shouldn’t stare.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Know what I think? I think that kid’s some
kinda lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Shouldn’t say such a thing about the poor
child. If you mean the bars, Marge is just being cautious, her being
alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Well, she ain’t gonna hang around our boy
no more.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hang on GLEN…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Well, I’m not gonna risk sneaking out until
she does.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Who at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Hello? Oh… Hold on. It’s her. She wants
to talk to Glen.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: What’s this about, Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: She says it’s private. Very private and
very important.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Glen’s asleep. Talk to him tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Just got to be firm with kids, is all.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen. Don’t fall asleep…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen?</p>
<p><strong>tight on her, zooming even closer on her ear and the
earpiece</strong>: as we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL
FINGERKNIVES.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Brilliant. Now what if Glen calls?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>krueger</strong>: I’m your boyfriend now…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m awake, I am awake. This is not a dream! I
am –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My boyfriend…!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Give me the key, mother.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t even have it on me, so forget it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Paid the guy damn good to make sure you
stayed put. You ain’t goin’ nowhere, kid. You’re gonna sleep tonight if
it kills me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: GLEEENNNNNN!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen!! Don’t fall asleeeeeep!</p>

<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant. It’s your daughter. Says it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Tell her I’m not here, tell her…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Uh, she just saw you, sir…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Hello Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hi daddy. I know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Then you know more than I do – I
haven’t even been upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You know he’s dead though, right?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Yeah, apparently he’s dead. How the
hell’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ve got a proposition for you. Listen very
carefully, please.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Nan, I –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Please. I’m gonna go get the guy who did it
and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Just tell me who did it and I’ll go get
him, baby.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can
get him. It’s my nightmare he comes to.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Where’d you hear about Krueger –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: – I want you to come over here and break the
door down exactly twenty minutes from now – can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, but…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’ll be exactly half past midnight. Time
for me to fall asleep and find him.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, sure, honey. You just do that –
get yourself some sleep – that’s what I’ve been saying all along.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And you’ll be here to catch him, right?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant – they’re waiting upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, okay, I’ll be there. Now you just
turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Get outside and watch her house. If you
see anything funny call me.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: ‘Anything funny’ like what?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I don’t know – but one thing for sure,
I don’t want her coming over here. She’s way too far gone to be able to
to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell did that, Lieutenant? There ain’t
even a head left.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Goddamned if I know. What’s the Coroner
say?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He’s in the john puking since he saw it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Guess I should’n’a done it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just sleep now, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted
to protect you…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord
my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul
to take.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I know it’s hard to think at a time
like this, Walter, but can you think of anyone who could’ve done such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: He done it.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Who? Who did that?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Krueger?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Had to’ve done it. No one else was in
there.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How you know that?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out
to see your lunatic daughter, that’s why. So I locked him in his room!
Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Maybe god’s punishing us all…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Keep your head – this is a fucking
flesh and blood killer we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Like Rod Lane?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lieutenant Thompson. Coroner wants to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Come out and show yourself, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m crazy after all…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Help! Hey – Daddy – I got him trapped! Where
are you!?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Everything’s going to be all right!
Everything’s under control!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Get my father, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You heard what I said! Now get back inside
or I’ll tell your dad!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy – for god’s sake’s run!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Daddy! Where are you!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Poor woman’s got her hands full with that
kid. Maybe I better tell the lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hey fuckface – can’t catch me!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Come on – he’s in here! Daddy! Don’t let him
kill me too!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: HEELLLPPP!!! Daddyyyyyyy!!!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hey – Daddy! Hey! I got the bastard!</p>
<p><strong>krueger</strong>: Ready for these?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Found you something, Donald. Should remind
you of something…</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Only place I ever heard of such a thing
before was ten years ago. Remember that fucker Fred Krueger?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey – your daughter’s acting kinda – !
Strange…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Oh, Jesus – Nancy! Hey! We got a
fire!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I got him – I got Fred Krueger!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What the hell are you talking about,
Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s after Mom! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s under there! Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Now do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You find him? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sir – here, let me light that for you –
Lieutenant? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know you’re there, Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: You think you was gonna get away from
me?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know you too well now, Freddie.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And now you die…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s too late, Krueger. I know the secret now
– this is just a dream, too – you’re not alive – the whole thing is a
dream – so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I take back every bit of energy I ever gave
you. You’re nothing. You’re shit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: God, it’s bright.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Gonna burn off soon or it wouldn’t be so
bright.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They say you’ve bottomed out when you can’t
remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don’t
feel like it any more.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Didn’t keep you up last night, did I? You
look a little peeked.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nah. Just slept heavy.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You believe this fog?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I believe anything’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Lookin’ good, girl!</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: One two – Freddy’s coming for you! Three four
– Better lock your door! Five six – Get your Crucifix Seven eight –
Gonna stay up late! Nine ten – Never sleep again!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You okay, Tina?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Just a dream, Ma… Damn dream, is all…</p>
<p><strong>tina’s mother</strong>: Some dream, judging from that.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You coming back to the sack or what?</p>
<p><strong>tina’s mother</strong>: Hold your horses. You gotta cut your
nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina. One or the other.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you… Three
four better lock your door Five six grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>rope jumpers</strong>: Seven eight, gonna stay up late! Nine
ten – never sleep again!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That’s what it reminded me of – that old jump
rope song. Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night
myself…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina.
Had your name written all over it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There’s four letters in my name, Rod. How
could there be room on your joint for four letters?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Rod says the sweetest things.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s nuts about you.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Yeah, nuts.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Anyway, I’m too tired to worry about the
creep. Couldn’t get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Forget it, the point is, every- body has
nightmares once in a while. No biggy.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Next time you have one, just tell yourself
that’s just all it is, right while you’re having it, y’know? That’s the
trick. Once you do that, you wake right up. At least it works for
me.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hey! You have a nightmare too?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Maybe we’re gonna have the Big Earthquake.
They say things get weird just before that…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I can’t believe his mother let him come over
here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right. Well, she didn’t, exactly…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: See, I got this cousin who lives near the
airport, that it’s okay for me to stay with, right? So I found this
sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Hello, Mom? Yeah, out here at Barry’s.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual. Glad we don’t live
here – huh? Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Right, right – I’ll call you in the morning!
Right! Huh? Yeah, sure, I, huh?…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Uh… some kid’s drag racing outside, I
think…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Listen, Mom, I got to go – I think there’s
been an accident out front – I –</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Right. I’ll call the police. No, just some
neighbors having a fight, I guess. I’m fine, I’m fine! Call you in the
morning!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Worked like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nice to have a fire.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Really. Turn ’er up a little.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over
too. He might get jealous.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Rod and I are done. He’s too much of a
maniac.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: He should join the Marines, they could make
something out of him. Like a hand grenade.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: See? You’ve forgotten the bad dream. Didn’t I
tell you?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: All day long I been seeing that guy’s weird
face, and hearing those fingernails…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fingernails? That’s amazing, you saying that.
It made me remember the dream I had last night.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What you dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and
yellow sweater; I dream in color, y’know; he walked into the room I was
in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and
just stared at me. Sort of …obscenely. Then he walked out through the
wall on the other side. Like he’d just come to check me out…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: So what about the fingernails?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He scraped his fingernails along things –
actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he’d made
them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose –
sssssccrrrtttt….</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy. You dreamed about the same creep I did,
Nancy…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: There’s somebody out there, isn’t there…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I didn’t hear anything…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I’m gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever
you are.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: It’s just a stupid cat.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Anyway, I don’t have a cat…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Kitty-kitty? Chow chow chow?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: And it’s number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing
Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle! And
the fans go wild!</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What the hell you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Of course. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Intense, huh? So what’s happening, an orgy or
something?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: – Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and
me. Glen was just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You see his face? Your ma ain’t home, is she?
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: We got her mother’s bed. You two got the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: We should get her out of here…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hey – you guys’re hanging around – right?
Don’t leave me alone with this lunatic – Pleeeeze, NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: So we’ll guard her together. Through the
night. In each others’ arms like we always said.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen. Not now. I mean, we’re here for Tina
now, not for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Why’s she so bothered by a stupid nightmare,
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Because he was scary, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who was scary?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t you think it’s weird, her and me
dreaming about the same guy? You didn’t have a bad dream last night, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me? I don’t dream.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Morality sucks.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I knew there was sometihng about you I
liked…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You feel better now, right?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Jungle man fix Jane.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: No more fights?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No more fights.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Good. No more nightmares for either of us
then.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: When did you have a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Guys can have nightmares too, y’know. You ain’t
got a corner on the fucking market or something.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Where’d you get this snotty old thing?</p>
<p><strong>angle back up on the ceiling just above her head.
something</strong>: presses against the surface from the inside. The
plaster buldges out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the
thing pressing from inside – taking the shape of a man’s face. The face
opens its mouth. The knives rake through the surface.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Who the fuck you think you are, whoever you
are?</p>
<p><strong>wide angle on the rear of the house. a light comes on.
tina</strong>: appears in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Somebody there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Tina.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Oh, shit, please God…</p>
<p><strong>killer</strong>: This is God…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy! Open the door – Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She’s still awake. Nancy can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: T-tina!?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: What the hell’s going ON here! Tina!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Tina –</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You motherfucker! I’ll kill you for that!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What the hell’s going on!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh – jeez – Glen! Rod’s gone ape!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I’ll kill you!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Rod? Rod, you better not hurt Tina…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. Something slippering all over here…
Tina?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I…I’m gonna call the cops –</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but
–</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I’d’ve canned your ass if you hadn’t.
What you got?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Her name was Tina Gray. It was her home.
Father abandoned ten years ago, mother’s in Vegas with a boyfriend.
We’re trying to reach her now.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What’s the Coroner got to say?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Something like a razor was the weapon, but
nothing found on the scene.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: Leautenant. You know who –</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: I put her in your office…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane.
Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope –</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Terrific. What the hell was she doing
there?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: She lived there.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: OMIT 37. I don’t mean her – OMIT
37.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I mean you. What the hell was she doing
there?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hello to you, too, Donald.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Marge.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How you doing, pal?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay. Hi, dad.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I don’t want to get into this now, god
knows you need time. But I’d sure would like to know what the hell you
were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night –
especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod’s not a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: You got a sane explanation for what he
did?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Apparantly he was crazy jealous. Nancy said
they’d had a fight, Rod and Tina.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It wasn’t that serious…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Maybe you don’t think murder’s serious –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She was my best friend! Don’t you dare say I
don’t take her death seriously! I just meant their fights weren’t that
serious.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She dreamed this would happen…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: She had a nightmare about somebody trying to
kill her, last night. That’s why we were there; she was afraid to sleep
alone.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She’s been through enough for one night. You
have her statement.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I suggest you keep a little better
track on her – she’s still a kid, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You think I knew there were boys there!? You
try raising a teenager alone.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: See they get home okay.</p>
<p><strong>tv newscaster</strong>: In the headlines this morning – a
local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all-night party.</p>
<p><strong>tv newscaster</strong>: Police say the victim, fifteen-year
-old Christina Grey, had quarrelled earlier with her boyfriend, Rod
Lane, a punk rocker with a history of delinquency. Lane is now the
subject of a city-wide manhunt. According to –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: School.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I could hear you tossing and turning all
night, kiddo. You’ve no business going to school.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I gotta go to school, Mom. Please. Otherwise
I’ll just sit up there and go crazy or something.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ll sleep in study hall, promise. I’d rather
keep busy, you know?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Right home after.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Your old man thinks I did it, don’t he?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He doesn’t know you. Couldn’t you change?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: The cops were all over my house. They’ll kill
me for sure.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nobody’s gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I never touched her.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You were screaming like crazy.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Someone else was there.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The door was locked from your side.</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Don’t look at me like I’m some kind of fucking
fruitcake or something, I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Morning, Mr. Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Now just step away from her, son. Like
your ass depended on it. I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>thompson</strong>: Jesus – are you crazy!?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I didn’t do it – ! I didn’t kill her,
Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You used me, daddy!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What the hell you doing going to school
today, anyway – your mother told me you didn’t even sleep last
night!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Nancy! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: According to Shakespeare, there was
something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that
was rotten – a canker, as he put it.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Of course Hamlet’s response to this, and to
his mother’s lies, was to continually probe and dig – just like the
gravediggers – always trying to get beneath the surface. The same was
true in a different way in Julius Caesar. Jon, go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: Uh, In the most high and palmy state of
Rome…</p>
<p><strong>wiseguy student</strong>: California’s the most high and
palmy state, man.</p>
<p><strong>english teacher</strong>: Can it.</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: In the most high and palmy state of Rome, a
little ere the mightiest Julius fell… The graves stood tenantless, and
the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the Roman street…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>surfer</strong>: O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad
dreams…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Tina!</p>
<p><strong>hallguard</strong>: Y-you’re not supposed to run. W-where’s
your pass – you got a pass?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Screw your stupid pass!</p>
<p><strong>hallguard</strong>: Hey, no running in the halls!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Tina?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Gonna get you.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Okay – Okay, Thompson! Every- thing’s all
right now – Nancy!.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’ll call your mother.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No! No, really, I’m fine. I’ll go straight
home. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: You’ll need a hall pass!</p>
<p><strong>omit 61a.</strong>: 62. But she shakes herself silent. Wipes
the tears away with a slash 62.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Couldn’t get back to sleep at all. What you
dream?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My dad here?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Decide to take a day off after all?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Only family allowed, Nancy. You know
the drill.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just want to talk to him a second.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: He’s dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You don’t know he did it.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: No, I know, thanks to your own
testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive
and came out in a rubber bag.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I just want to talk to him. Please, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I told you. It was dark, but I’m sure there was
someone else IN there, under the covers with her.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: How could somebody get under the covers with
you guys without you knowing it?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: How the fuck do I know? I don’t expect you to
believe me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What he look like? You get a look at him?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Well then how can you say somebody else was
there?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Because somebody cut her. While I watched.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Somebody cut her while you watched and you
don’t know what he looked like?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: You couldn’t see the fucker. You could just see
the cuts happening, all at once.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What you mean ‘all at once’?</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I mean, it was as if there were four razors
cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just… opened
up…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod!</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: I probably could’ve saved her if I’d moved
sooner… But I thought it was just another nightmare, like the one I had
the night before. There… was this guy who had knives for fingers…</p>
<p><strong>rod</strong>: Do you think I did it?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy, don’t fall asleep in there.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Get into bed.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You’re not falling asleep, are you? You could
drown, you know.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mother, for petesakes.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It happens all the time. I’ve got some warm
milk all ready for you. Why don’t you jump into bed? I’m gonna turn on
your electric blanket, too. C’mon, now.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Warm milk. Gross.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: One, two, Freddie’s coming for you, three
four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight
gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy! NANCY!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I told you! Hundreds of people a year drown
like that!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Great</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: To bed with you, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No television, forget the homework, no phone
calls.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: And no school tomorrow, either. you take a
little vacation, relax and rest for a change.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yes, Mother. G’night.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Take this, it’ll help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sleep tight, don’t let the bedbugs bite.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Sorry! Saw your light on. Thought I’d see how
you were.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Sometimes I wish you didn’t live right across
the street.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a
rose trellis in your bare feet?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: If you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: So. I heard you freaked out in English class
today.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Guess I did.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Haven’t slept, have you?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You look dead and rained on, if you want the
ugly truth. And what you do to your arm?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Burned myself in Englsh class.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: M’god, I look twenty years old. You have any
weird dreams last night?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Slept like a rock.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Well at least I have an objective wall to
bounce this off. You believe it’s possible to dream about what’s going
to happen?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe in the Boogey Man?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: One two, Freddie’s coming for you? No. Rod
killed Tina. he’s a fruitcake and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe in anything?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And
I’m not too sure about you lately.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s nothing too hard or anything. I’m just
going to… LOOK for someone, and… I want you to be sort of a …guard.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Okay, okay. I think.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You won’t screw up, right? I mean, a whole
lot might depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Okay, I won’t screw up.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Jesus, it’s dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Shhh. Now listen, here’s what we’re gonna
do…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You still there?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just checking – keep out of sight!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Still there?</p>
<p><strong>glen’s voice</strong>: Still here!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: On your toes, right?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen?!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I swear…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen, where are you! Wake up! Glen!</p>
<p><strong>deep ragged voice</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen! Glen!!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glennn!!!</p>
<p><strong>angle at floor level – close on nancy’s and the killer’s
heads.</strong>: The blades inch towards the girl’s face – the drool of
the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her
eyes. Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen, you bastard…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What I do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay
awake and watch me – Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad
dream. But you. You shit – what do you do – you fall asleep!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I must be going nuts…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yes, mother?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah. Just had a little dream. I’m falling
right back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Okay… You need anything, just call.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You mind telling me what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh, I see. That makes it all perfectly
clear.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: I thought when I took the night shift
I’d have peace and quiet for a change.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s urgent, we’ve gotta see Rod.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: It’s three in the morning. Your mother
know you’re out this late?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Of course – look, at least go back and look
at him. Just see if he’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: We have reason to think there might be
something weird going on.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Oh, no argument on that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Dad – what you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: It so happens I work here, and there’s
an unsolved murder. I don’t like unsolved murders, especially ones my
daughter’s mixed up in – what are you doing here at this hour? You’re
supposed to be getting some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a
nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she
thinks…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I just want to see if he’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Take my word for it, Nancy. The guy’s
sleeping like a baby. He’s not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: This isn’t your average nightmare, Daddy –
damn it!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Now look, Nancy, don’t push it. You’ve
already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence – don’t start throwing
in insanity!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just go back and check – please!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Okay, Garcia. What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Right… Now where’d I put the key…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Rod!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Gimme a hand, dammit!</p>
<p><strong>sgt garcia</strong>: Goddamn loco kid – he didn’t have t’do
that – Madre dios!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How’d you know he was gonna do
this?</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be
with this young man’s soul.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: His life and his death attest to the
Scripture’s warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the
sword.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: But let us recall also our Lord’s
admonition that we ‘Judge not, lest we be judged.’ Let us attempt only
to love. And may Rod Lane rest in peace.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Amen to that much.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How’s Nancy doing?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t think she’s slept since Tina died.
She’s always been a delicate kid.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: She’s tougher than you think. Any idea
how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No. All I know is, this reminds me too much
of ten years ago.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Yeah. Well… Let’s not start digging up
bodies just because we’re in a cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Time to go home, baby.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The killer’s still loose, you know.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: You saying somebody else killed Tina?
Who?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t know who he is. But he’s burned, he
wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses
some sort of knifes he’s got made into a sort of… glove. Like giant
finger- nails.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I think you should keep Nancy at home a
few days. ’Til she’s really over the shock.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I got something better… I’m gonna get you
help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: But I just don’t feel… ready to sleep yet.
Please, do I have to?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Don’t worry, you’re not gonna change into
Bride of Frankenstein or anything.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses?
Scarlet Fever? High temperatures – concussions?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He means, did you ever drop me on my
head.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Nightmares are expected after psychological
trauma. Don’t worry, they go away.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I sure as hell hope so.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I don’t see why you couldn’t just give me a
pill to keep me from dreaming…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Everyone’s got to dream. If you don’t
dream, you go… All set?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They’re just simple tests, Nan. We’ll both be
right here.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Look, I know it’s been fright- ening, I
know your dreams have seemed real. But… it’s okay. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Please, Nancy. Trust us.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s not you I don’t trust. It’s… Okay. Let’s
do it.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: How long’s this been going on?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Since the murder. She was fine before
that.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Not to worry. No signs of path- ology in
Nancy’s EEG or pulse rate. I’d guess what we’ve got is a normal young
girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It’s just made her think… her dreams are
real…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Ever hear the old Buddhist tale about the
King who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, good. She’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What the hell are dreams, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus.
Truth is we still don’t know what they are or where they come from. As
for nightmares… Did you know that in the last three years twenty
Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not
from heart attacks, either. They just died.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What happened? That needle sank like a
rock.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: She’s entering deep sleep now. Heart rate’s
a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she’s nicely relaxed. All
normal. She could dream at any time now. Right now she’s like a diver on
the bottom of an ocean no one’s mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows
up.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, she’s started to dream.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: R.E.M.’s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes
follow the dream – their movement picks up on this –</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Beta Waves are slowing, too. She’s
dreaming, all right. A good one, too.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Typical dream parameter. A nightmare, now,
would be plus or minus five or six; she’s just around three point –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What the hell’s this? She awake or
asleep?</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Can’t be. It never gets this high…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Now, this is just going to let you relax
and sleep, Nan –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No. That’s enough sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Okay, kid. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh my god, oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>dr king</strong>: Get the kit!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You believe this?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where the hell did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I grabbed it off his head.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: She said she snatched it off his head in a
dream. No, I’m not crazy, I’ve got the damn thing in my hand! I know we
did, we all… Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You didn’t sleep, did you? The doctor says
you have to sleep or you’ll –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Go even crazier?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t think you’re going crazy – and stop
drinking that damn coffee!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Did you ask Daddy to have the hat
examined?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I threw that filthy thing away – I don’t know
what you’re trying to prove with it, but –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What I learned at the dream clinic, that’s
what I’m trying to prove. Rod didn’t kill Tina, and he didn’t hang
himself. It’s this guy – he’s after us in our dreams.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: But that’s just not reality, Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s real, Mamma. Feel it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Put that damned thing down!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: His name is even in it – written right in
here – Fred Krueger – Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mamma? You
better tell me, cause now he’s after me!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy, trust your mother for once – you’ll
feel better as soon as you sleep!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You call this feeling better? Or should I
grab a bottle and veg out with you – avoid everything happening to me by
just getting good and loaded –</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Fred Krueger can’t be after you, Nancy – he’s
dead!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Fred Krueger is dead. Dead and gone. Believe
me, I know. Now go to bed. I order you, go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You knew about him all this time, and you’ve
been acting like he was someone I made up!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You’re sick, Nancy. Imagining things. You
need to sleep, it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Screw sleep!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy – it’s only a nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Whenever I get nervous I eat.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And if you can’t do that, you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Used to. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You ever read about the Balinese way of
dreaming?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: They got a whole system they call ‘dream
skills’. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling,
right?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you
say, okay, I’m gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world
where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all
their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down.
Dreamskills.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And what if they meet a monster in their
dream? Then what?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: They turn their back on it. Takes away its
energy, and it disappears.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What happens if they don’t do that?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I guess those people don’t wake up to tell
what happens.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: ‘Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personel
Devices’!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore
on Ventura.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Well what you reading it for?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m into survival.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: She’s starting to scare the living shit out of
me.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: And the other…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Where’s your mask and gun?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Don’t bust my chops, lady. If the city
found out I put ’em in without inside releases I’d loose my license.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh gross…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mom, what’s with the bars!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh, Mom…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: ’S’mine…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What’s with the bars?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: S’curity.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred
Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Dead and gone.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I want to know how, where – if you don’t tell
me, I’m going to call daddy.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Your father the cop. That’s a good one.
Forget Fred Krueger. You don’t want to know, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I do want to know. He’s not dead and gone –
he’s after me and if I sleep he’ll get me! I’ve got to know!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: You want to know who Fred Krueger was? He was
a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area,
kids we all knew. It drove us all crazy when we didn’t know who was
doing it – but it was even worse when they caught him.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous,
but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and
Fred Krueger was free, just like that.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: So he’s alive?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: He wouldn’ve stopped. The bastard would’ve
got more kids first chance he got – they found nearly ten bodies in his
boiler room as it was. But the law couldn’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: What was needed were some private citizens
willing to do what had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What did you do, mother?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Bunch of us parents tracked him down after
they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw
him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore,
drunk an’ asleep with his weird knives by his side…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: We poured gasoline all around the place, left
a trail out the door, locked the door, then…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: But just when it seemed not even the devil
could live in there any more – he crashed out like a banshee, all on
fire – swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming
he… he was going to get us by killing all our kids…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: There were all those men, Nancy, even your
father, oh yes, even him. But none could do what had to be done –
Krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear – no
one could take your father’s gun and kill him good and proper except
me.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So he’s dead Nan. He can’t get you. Mommy
killed him.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Who was there? Were Tina’s parents there?
Were Rod’s?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Sure, and Glen’s. All of us. But that’s in
the past now, baby. Really. It’s over. We even took his knives.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: All these years you’ve kept those things
buried down here? In our own house?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Proof he’s declawed. As for him, we buried
him good and deep.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: So’s okay, you can sleep.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Oh. Hi, how y’doing?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fine. Stand by your window so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Much better.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I heard your ma went ape at the security store
today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long’s it
been since you slept?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Coming up on the seventh day. It’s okay, I
checked Guiness. The record’s eleven, and I’ll beat that if I have to.
Listen, I… I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: The killer.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Yeah, and if he gets me, I’m pretty sure
you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Don’t ask – just give me some help nailing
this guy when I bring him out.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Bring him out of what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My dream.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: How you plan to do that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the
sucker when you wake me up.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Me? Wait a minute, you can’t bring someone out
of a dream!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: If I can’t, then you all can relax, because
it’ll just be a simple case of me being nuts.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I can save you the trouble. You’re nutty as a
fruitcake. I love you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Good, then you won’t mind cold-cocking this
guy when I bring him out.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You heard me. I grab him in the dream – you
see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the
fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You crazy? Hit him with what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You’re a jock. You must have a baseball bat
or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Meanwhile..?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Meanwhile whatever you do don’t fall asleep.
Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Holy shit! Midnight. Baseball bats and
boogemen. Unfucking real.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Can’t sleep, thought I’d come break up
the poker game.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: If it was any more quiet we could
hear owls farting.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Is quiet, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant garcia</strong>: How’s your girl?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: She’s sensible. She’ll sleep sooner or
later.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: You’d think they’d have some- thing ’bout
the Lane kid hanging himself.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Maybe we’re all making more out of it
than we should.</p>
<p><strong>carson</strong>: I wouldn’t touch that line with a ten foot
pole.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Glen? you all right?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Glen honey?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Whuu?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: How can you listen to Carson and a record
at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Wasn’t listening to the tube, just watching.
Miss Nude America’s supposed to be on tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Well how you gonna hear what she
says?</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Who cares what she says?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: You should get to sleep soon, Glen. It’s
almost midnight. Goodness knows we’ve all had enough of a time the last
few days…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: I will, Mom…in a while. You guys turning
in?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: We’ll go away, take a vacation. Get your hair
colored nice, the way it was. No one will ever know. This whole room
smells of coffee, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: It’s all over now, baby. The nightmare’s
over. Please.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Night-night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Shouldn’t stare.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Know what I think? I think that kid’s some
kinda lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Shouldn’t say such a thing about the poor
child. If you mean the bars, Marge’s just being cautious, her being
alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Well, she ain’t gonna hang around our boy
no more.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hang on GLEN…</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: Well, I’m not gonna risk sneaking out until
she does.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Who at this hour?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: Hello? Oh… Hold on. It’s her. She wants
to talk to Glen.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: What’s this about, Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>mrs lantz</strong>: She says it’s private. Very private and
very important.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Glen’s asleep. Talk to him tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Just got to be firm with kids, is all.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen. Don’t fall asleep…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Brilliant. Now what if Glen calls?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>krueger</strong>: I’m your boyfriend now…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m awake, I am awake. This is not a dream! I
am –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My boyfriend…!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Locked.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Give me the key, mother.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I don’t even have it on me, so forget it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Paid the guy damn good to make sure you
stayed put. You ain’t goin’ nowhere, kid. You’re gonna sleep tonight if
it kills me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Glen!! Don’t fall asleeeeeep!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your
court.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant. It’s your daughter. Says it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Tell her I’m not here, tell her…</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Uh, she just saw you, sir…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Hello Nancy.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hi daddy. I know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Then you know more than I do – I
haven’t even been upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: You know he’s dead though, right?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Yeah, apparantly he’s dead. How the
hell’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’ve got a proposition for you. Listen very
carefully, please.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Nan, I –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Please. I’m gonna go get the guy who did it
and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Just tell me who did it and I’ll go get
him, baby.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can
get him. It’s my nightmare he comes to.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Where’d you hear about Krueger –</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: – I want you to come over here and break the
door down exactly twenty minutes from now – can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, but…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: That’ll be exactly half past midnight. Time
for me to fall asleep and find him.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, sure, honey. You just do that –
get yourself some sleep – that’s what I’ve been saying all along.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And you’ll be here to catch him, right?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Lieutenant – they’re waiting upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Sure, okay, I’ll be there. Now you just
turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Get outside and watch her house. If you
see anything funny call me.</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: ‘Anything funny’ like what?</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I don’t know – but one thing for sure,
I don’t want her coming over here. She’s way too far gone to be able to
to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What the hell did that, Lieutenant? There ain’t
even a head left.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Goddamed if I know. What’s the Coronor
say?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He’s in the john puking since he saw it.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Guess I should’n’a done it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Just sleep now, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted
to protect you…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: I know it’s hard to think at a time
like this, Walter, but can you think of anyone who could’ve done such a
thing?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: He done it.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Who? Who did that?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Krueger?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Had to’ve done it. No one else was in
there.</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: How you know that?</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out
to see your lunatic daughter, that’s why. So I locked him in his room!
Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Maybe god’s punishing us all…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Keep your head – this is a fucking
flesh and blood killer we’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>mr lantz</strong>: Like Rod Lane?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Lieutenant Thompson. Coronor wants to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: These rewrites of scenes 180 and 180 A replace
NANCY walking through the ‘dream streets’ at night, and NANCY
approaching the huge deserted building at night, prior to her entering
the Boiler Room the final time.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Come out and show yourself, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I’m crazy after all…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Help! Hey – Daddy – I got him trapped! Where
are you!?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Everything’s going to be all right!
Everything’s under control!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Get my father, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You heard what I said! Now get back inside
or I’ll tell your dad!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Nancy – for god’s sake’s run!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Daddy! Where are you!</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Poor woman’s got her hands full with that
kid. Maybe I better tell the lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hey fuckface – can’t catch me!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Come on – he’s in here! Daddy! Don’t let him
kill me too!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: HEELLLPPP!!! Daddyyyyyyy!!!!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Hey – Daddy! Hey! I got the bastard!</p>
<p><strong>krueger</strong>: Ready for these?</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Found you something, Donald. Should remind
you of something…</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: Only place I ever heard of such a thing
before was ten years ago. Remember that fucker Fred Krueger?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Hey – your daughter’s acting kinda – !
Strange…</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: Oh, Jesus – Nancy! Hey! We got a
fire!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I got him – I got Fred Krueger!</p>
<p><strong>lt thompson</strong>: What the hell are you talking about,
Nancy?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s after Mom! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: He’s under there! Watch it!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Now do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: You find him? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>parker</strong>: Sir – here, let me light that for you –
Lieutenant? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know you’re there, Krueger.</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: You think you was gonna get away from
me?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I know you too well now, Freddie.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: And now you die…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s too late, Krueger. I know the secret now
– this is just a dream, too – you’re not alive – the whole thing is a
dream – so fuck off! I want my mother and friends again.</p>
<p><strong>freddie</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: I take back every bit of energy I ever gave
you. You’re nothing. You’re shit.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: God, it’s bright.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Gonna burn off soon or it wouldn’t be so
bright.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: They say you’ve bottomed out when you can’t
remember the night before. No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don’t
feel like it any more.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Didn’t keep you up last night, did I? You
look a little peeked.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Nah. Just slept heavy.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>glen</strong>: You believe this fog?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: I believe anything’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Lookin’ good, girl!</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: One two – Freddy’s coming for you! Three four

Gonna stay up late! Nine ten – Never sleep again!</p>
