<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Mum… Oh Mum, God will surely strike us
-</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Wind - I love you with that which is
endless within me. Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice…</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Send me your soul. Come to me NOW!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Suzanne, the door is open! Call me! Bring
me to you with a name!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: For the wind that lashes the trees that
brings you to your lover… You are — Lasher. LASHER!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I am through, my love! I have come!
Lasher..</p>
<p><strong>ecu - deborah’s clenched fist</strong>: The tiny fist opens -
a NUGE EMERALD glistens in her palm.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Do you see the lillies, Deedee…? Big
as soup ladles.</p>
<p><strong>ecu - a face, skocking in its melancholy visage</strong>: A
WOMAN - 50, a gaunt, shattered beauty. Not a flicker in her green eyes.
Her hair is stringy - in need of a wash.</p>
<p><strong>angle - the porch of a large gothic mansion</strong>:
CARLOTTA MAYFAIR - 80, cane in hand, rocks DIEDRE MAYFAIR on the porch.
Her white hair is pulled back severely. Skin tight on her skull. Green
eyes keen and focused.</p>
<p><strong>angle - the gaden beyond the porch</strong>: Thick. Lush.
Huge flowers flourish. A flagstone walk leads to a swimming pool filled
with brackish water and lily pads. A wrought-iron fence encircles the
grounds. on the other side, the street seems like another world.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: We numb the body and the mind…but we
haven’t found a needle yat that can prick your soul. That belongs to
him, doesn’t it, my beautitul Deedee…?</p>
<p><strong>beyond the wrot-iron fence</strong>: A MAN - 60, white suit,
fedora and an ivory walking stick - comes down the sidewalk. He tips his
hat to the women, and walks on. CARLOTTA watches him go.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Well, well, Deedee. Both your admirers
have paid a call.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Diedre was silent - still - as
always….</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: ..but there is no question about it she is
dying.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Her vibrations were unmistakable. I felt them
quite clearly. Strange to think after thirty years…I shall walk by the
porch and find the chair empty.</p>
<p><strong>woman at the table</strong>: What of the child, Aaron…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The child’s life will take its inevitable
turn. we will watch and wait… and soon - our waiting will be over</p>
<p><strong>int. close-up - a pair of white doors</strong>: In bold
letters EMEAGENCY ONLY - KEEP CLEAR The doors fly open - PARAMEDICS
barrel through, pushing a gurney with a bleeding WOMAN. We TRACK behind
it A WOMAN suddenly races INTO FRAME, into the gurney’s path. The gurney
veers off - but we fallow the WOMAN.</p>
<p><strong>rowan mayfair</strong>: - 30, surgical garb and gloves,
golden hair. piercing green eyes, stunning, focused. She enters:</p>
<p><strong>an emergency room</strong>: where two NURSES and a young
DOCTOR flank a gurney that holds a BOY - 7, unconscious. ROWAN is pure,
efficient motion - in coumand. As she nears the Boy -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Let’s have it. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Parents say he - uh - fell -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Anybody got a BP yet…?</p>
<p><strong>nurse # 1</strong>: Seventy over ninety.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Pupils…?</p>
<p><strong>nurse # 1</strong>: Unequal.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: - and he seemed okay. Just banged his -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: FAST.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: uh - then he - be just -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He just went out like &amp; light-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Massive subdural hamatoma. We have to evacuat
it - right now.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ll tell OR we’re bringing -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He’s herniating! Forget OR. He’s dead batore
he’s oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray - Anesthesia - stat! We
need him intubated and blow down!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Get me a bolt…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Dress it. Get him to ICU…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He’ll be okay…</p>
<p><strong>nurse # 1</strong>: So, doctcr - what do you see.. I see
somebody spending nineteen hours a day in this hole. This isn’t even
your shift is it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: If ’d been home, I would’ve missed out on
using the drill.</p>
<p><strong>nurse # 1</strong>: Take up woodworking.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You just can’t bear to lose one - can you…?
you just won’t 1et them die.</p>
<p><strong>rowan’</strong>: No - I guess I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>michael curry</strong>: - 40, denim shirt baggy corduroys,
melancholy wisp of a smile. Gettle eyes staring into the night. A drag
on his cigarette. And he rubs the cleft of his chin with the tip of his
thumb - a life-long unconscious habit.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Right on schedule, Mikey. Finished
-</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘I left my heart — in Ran Sanfriscio…’</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: - in three weeks, tops, like it or
not.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘And the light’s always onnnnn in
Massachuaetts…’</p>
<p><strong>wide of scene</strong>: STU - 35, overalls, short, squat,
dusty - stands at a table draped with blueprints - beer in hand.
grinning.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Ve-ry funny. But lilk. it or not -</p>
<p><strong>michael and stu</strong>: ‘THEY CALLLLLLLLL THE RISING
SUN….!’</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: sooner Or later you’re gonna run out of things
to change. You always do.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I just - hate it when they’re -
finished.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: well - Donna made dinner tonight. so I gotta
go. Wanna come..? Gotta date…? Ever gonna have another date…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: See ya Monday then.</p>
<p><strong>angel - 0n the sailboat’s deck</strong>: ROWAN - in sweater
and shorts - looks at the sky, searching for wind, and frowns. She
strips down to a bikini, stretches out on the deck and points her face
to the sun…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ’The soaring larks lift up aloft with them
the sky that to our shoulders was heavy. YOU like Rilke…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dame weatherman said -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: falling in the water. Losing ccnsciousness.
Being swept out to tea. His eyes closing. he’s going under -
Sinking..</p>
<p><strong>beneath the sea</strong>: MICHAEL floats downward. A stream
at bubbles squirts from his mouth then they stop. MOVE IN to his
peaceful face. IN TIGHTER - into his closed eyes - and through them…</p>
<p><strong>pov - speeding through a black night sky with a zillion
stars</strong>: A fierce ROARING. Hair-pin ttrrns around stars - the
cosmic Daytona 500. Racing toward a huge, white-hot star… SMASHING
through into - SILENCE. Freefalling through the richest, thickest GREEN
imaginable.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Go back, MICHAEL… Go Back</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: The door, Michael. find the key…</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Help us. Do what you can.</p>
<p><strong>angle - mihael. motionless in the green</strong>: suspended
above a vast BLACKNESS. phantoms all around him. And MICAEL starts
floating down toward it…</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Michael - NO! Go Back</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Alright! A little speed.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: one - two - three - four - five-..</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Breathe, goddamnit- BREATHE!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re not - - gonna - - DIE - - you
sonuvabitch</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They - they wanted me to come back…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He had a major M.I. two years ago. Get an
EKG and see if this did anything to his heart-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Michael - it’s Geoffrey-</p>
<p><strong>michael’s pov</strong>: The DOCTOR’S face disappears in a
blure of WHITE. Then, with a ROAR. The FRAME FILLS with</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Clear!!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Give me the atropeen!</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: MICHAEL lets go at the handrail - as
if shocked - and clasps his hands together. He locks round the room,
saucer-eyed. GEOFFREY eyes him carefully as he gives him an
injection.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What the HELL IS GOING…?!</p>
<p><strong>doctcr</strong>: You where - in the water - a long time.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No! Geoffrey, I’m seeing…seeing… There was
a - a dead woman - she was -</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: The shot’s kicking in. Sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: GEOFFREY, hands behind his back,
stands at the bedside as MICHAEL, groggy from the injection. Starts to
go under.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I - I didn’t think You - You fooled around
with your patients, Geoffrey…</p>
<p><strong>a completely white frame</strong>: Then — the whiteness
swings on an axis TOWARD CAMERA— a refrigeretor has been opened -
revealing an interior filled with beer. A gloved hand reaches in and
grabs one.</p>
<p><strong>an exquisitely desinged bedroom</strong>: There is clutter
evetywhere: newspapers, magazines, books, beer cans. MICHAEL plops on
the dishevelled bed. Glances at a magazine. A story title reads:</p>
<p><strong>life after death experiences</strong>: :AN ANALYTIC
APPROACH</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No more freak shows! LEAVE ME ALONE!</p>
<p><strong>stu’s voice</strong>: Mike - it’s me! Let me in!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Go home, Stu I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Bullshit! Let me in! Mikey - there are people
who can help figure this ont.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: On which planet…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You can’t just -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Go away, GODDAMNIT!</p>
<p><strong>back to michael in the attic</strong>: as he is jolted to the
floor, one hand grasping the helmet.</p>
<p><strong>a small boy</strong>: - 8, in a black suit - holding a singed
fireman’s helmet with an N.O. 17 insignia. He watches the coffin pass,
fascinated.</p>
<p><strong>the boys pov</strong>: A tall, wavy-haired MAN in
ninteent-century garb walks solemnly beside the coffin. The Pallbearers
don’t seem to notice. He gives the Boy a melancholy smile.</p>
<p><strong>the boy</strong>: Pokes his Mother and points to the man. But
she just pats his hand solemnly. She doesn’t see what he sees…</p>
<p><strong>back to michael on the attic floor</strong>: as he drops the
helmet - and weeps</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: So - how fast does it go…?’</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Reallll fast. Seven hundred miles an hour…
Mmmmm… A minute</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Wow! That’s almost as fast as my car.</p>
<p><strong>angel - michael standing in the doorway</strong>: He’s
watching ROWAN. He is hollow-eyed. gaunt - but clean- shaven in clean
clothes. ROWAN is unaware at his presence.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s if I turn on the retro-burners. Of
course, I only do that if r’m being chased. Never been caught yet.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: How’s your head, Terry–? Feel anything - like
a balloon in there…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dr. — Mayfair…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mr. Curry- - -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They like you ——- kids.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I guess so. The trick is remembering how to
act like one. I’m glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you. Why
don’t we go to my office…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ve read the stories - and seen the news
coverage.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘Freak at the week.’ That’s what the TV
crew. call it- people come right to the house. They have a husband or
wife who skipped town - or a missing kid- They bring a sweater or a toy
- and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t remember you at all- You - you
saved my life- Bizarre thing to say, isn’t it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m glad you’re around to say it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My jury’s still out on that,</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever’s
happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative. I’m in the
life business - remember..?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Let’s see what we can find out-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Do they keep everything ‘out’ …?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: As far as touching things, yes. But the
vision - that keeps pouring into my head- It won’t go away God - if I
could just understand it.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You had no pulse-.. You were gone.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Don’t be afraid, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What do you see…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nothing. Absolutely nothing-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Just one. The bar’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The one time I want it to work…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You know - doors and keyholes are common
signposts in out-of-body -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re not gonna give me the textbook
analysia, are you doctor…? My vision was just the chemical reaction of
an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No. I’m not. Doctors should be the first ones
to admit utter ignorance about some things.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Touch me. My hands were all over you. Maybe
something will come from me. Touch me Michael-</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s voice</strong>: OWWWWWWW….!</p>
<p><strong>suddenly back to rowan’s kitchen</strong>: as ROWAN - with a
yelp - wrenches her hands free or MICHAEL’S vise girp. He tumbles
backwards onto the floor. ROWAN races round to him and kneels - cradling
his head geritly</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My gloves…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I saw it. On the boat, I was - dead. you
brought me back…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: …with these.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Harder…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rowan…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: HARDER!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Like this…? LIKE THIS…?!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Yessssss…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: you’re very — different.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ll bet you say that to all the women who
bring you back to life and then seduce you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What else did you see- Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’re you - a mindreader…? Who was the
man on the kitchen floor. ~.?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: My uncle. Graham. He and my Aunt, Ellie
raised me. He - he - had a stroke- Just before Ellie died - of cancer.
Last year.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You knelt there, helpless- You couldn’t
save him. There was so such anger in you-. Death infuriates you…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s unbelievable that you can do that.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It - it feels like - like I’m being filled
up. crowded out of myself. Like I’m fading away-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re here, Michael. All of you.</p>
<p><strong>michael lying on his stomach on the dock - daytime</strong>:
his head out over the edge, staring at his reflection</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ve always loved them. New Orleans has
these great old houses. When I was a kid, I’d look at them, thinking -
‘somebody dreamed them up, put something where there was nothing…’ it
amazed me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My mother and I used to take long walks and
make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside. The
Queen’s house-. the Gangster’s house-. the clown’s house- Like that.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: And whose houses do you design…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Oh. The Green underwater Ghost’s… The Man
With The Eyes In His Hands…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You still feel that crazy…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. Not vith you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I was born, in New Orleans, too-</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Really…? Your family there…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Nope- My father died before I was born. My
mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she
brought me here… the day after I was born.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Too much… too fast…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth
and the flame.</p>
<p><strong>geoffrey</strong>: …always concerned about his heart - so the
fact he isn’t drinking is great.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ll keep you up to date Geoffrey.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He’s very pleased with your response to the
surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He fools around with his patients too.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: you touched him — and saw him…? What was he
doinging. Kinky…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s come to that, huh…? Three weeks - and
you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It would appear that’s not the case…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You come back from the dead and you can’t
make one dumb word…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You look very deep when you do that. It’s
interesting. We’re Complete opposites- I’d never just sit and wait for
insparation. I’d skip my turn and swap some letters.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ms. yin, and Mr. yang Aha!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H. Yu-hee-yah…? No way, busters
use it in a sentence.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay. y’all make sure and come back now,
reeeeal soon - yu’heeyah.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Hey - no fair! That’s not a word!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why don’t you let at do that…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Doctor’s orders- - -?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Captain’s orders.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You sure are.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Far from it, Michael… Don’t put me up
there.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: All I meant was -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You don’t know what you meant - because you
don’t know me.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Christ, Michael - what the hell are we
doing…? We don’t even know -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Is this the part where you try and talk
yourself out of how good this is…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m serious. You don’t -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Let’s see… Next you tell me all the
terrible things about you - and prove that we’re doomed to fail -
right…? you hate kittens and puppies, you’ve drivin all your lovers to
suicide –and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You stop it. you’re loving, and gentel..
You’re the most remarkable woman I’ve ever met — so stop telling me I
don’t know what I feel just cause you’re scared. Cause it won’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ro — what is it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What you ‘saw’ — me in the kitchen - with
Grahm - when he was dying…? My anger wasn’t frustration Michael. It was
hatred. He tried to molest me while his wife lay half-dead in the
hospital! Ellie’s love was the one thing that connected me to the world.
Sha was all I ever had. At that moment, I hated Graham with a fury you
could never imagine… pause)… and that’s when he had his stroke. I wanted
him to die. Howqs that for ‘perfect’ …?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m a doctor, Michael, and I wanted him to
die.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Seems more like a year than a month.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - this place is increadible. You -
you’re brilliant… The things you created…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological
Institute In L.A., remember…? He said he’d see you. He was
intrigned.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: God knows, I’m intriguing.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael, do you want to wear those for the
rest of your life…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You could fly down tomorrow. I could be there
the next day I think I can last that long without you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: We’re quite a pair, you and I.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mad. for each other.</p>
<p><strong>close-up - diedre’s face in the moonlight</strong>: as a tear
rolls down her cheek - then changes direction - moving across her cheek,
and disappears - as if someone had brushed it away. A haunting smile
blooms - her eyes close…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I - I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But look! LOOK! How can I do it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan shoots up in her bed at night</strong>: jolted awake by
the rain whipping at her windows. The clock says 3 A.M. The rain is like
a WHISPER. Every nerve-end at attention. She reaches under the bed and
brings up a bat. Heart pounding. Stepping into the hall, reaching</p>
<p><strong>the darkened living room</strong>: The WIND MOANS. The rain
flows thickly down the glass walls, giving the sky and ocean beyond a
weird, melted look.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It somebody’s here —</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ll take your goddamn head off.’</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s voice</strong>: you’ve reached 555-2lO1.</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Ellie…? Ellie - are you there…?
Dammit. 555 - 2 - 1 - 0 - 1 Ellie — this is Carlotta.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: E11ie - Diedre died at five o’clock this
morning. Obviously, there are 1egal matters. Your discretion will be

<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Hello…? Who is this…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Who is this…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Rowan Mayfair. Who’s calling…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.</p>
<p><strong>rowan’</strong>: Ellie Mayfair is — dead.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Dead…? Why was I not notified of Ellie’s
death…?!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I beg your par—</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: When did she die…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Who is this…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: This is your aunt. Carlotta Mayfair. In
New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I don’t have any aunts - and I’ve never heard
of a ‘Carlotta’ - or, for that matter - a ‘Diedre’! Just who -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Diedre Mayfair was your mother.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: My…mother…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Yes. Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your
attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But my mother… Ellie said she died -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: I under5tand. All the same</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: -Ellie said she died when I was BORN! She’s
been alive…? ALL THIS TIME…? Why have I been lied to when -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: I had you sent away.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Who the hel1 -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: It was quite warranted by the - situation.
I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her.
It’s not as if you’ve suffered some great -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What’s the matter with you…?! What kind of
person are you…?!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: A very tired one. I’ve been up all night -
and I would .like to rest before the funeral. Have your lawyer -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: When is the funeral…? I am coming to my
mother’s funeral!!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Out of the question Rowan, coming here
will not change the -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m coming down there!! And it you put my
mother in the ground betore I arrive, you’ll wish you’d never seen my
face! IS THAT UNDERSTOOD…?!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Lenigan’s Mortuary. St. Charles and
Carondolet. One o’clock. You should not do this Rowan.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael! Jesus I’ve been trying -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rowan…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Listen. Last night - oh Christ, this’1l take
forever to explain. God, Michael…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What’s wrong..?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I’ll
- I’ll call yati when I -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What about you coming down here…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.
Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me. I’ll call you there.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wait a minute. Rowan - what is going
on…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Goodbye, Michael. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Harder…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Rowan…</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Harder…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Like this… LIKE
THIS…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Yessss…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice [in her head]</strong>: Always loved you. Rowan.
Always…</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: God-Only-knows what went on in her
head…</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Been in back yet…? Lonigan did quite a job.
Best she’s looked since the baby. Sixty-three…?</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Sixty-one… I remember, cause Julien was
still alive.</p>
<p><strong>rowan in the main entrance</strong>: - suitcase in hand.
bewilderment clouding her face. A MAN - 45, black suit, somber -
approaches her. BEATRICE MAYFAIR - 40, a lush figure in a satin dress -
turns and stares.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Good afternoon. I’m Jerry Lonigan. May I ask
who -</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Oh my god… Is it…? Mother of Christ -
she’s here…</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You are, aren’t you…? You’re Rowan!</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Rowan - I’m Beatrice Maytair. Your cousin.
Deedee…you’r mother and I - we - we grew up together.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I want to see my mother.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We - uh - we did what we could. The skin was… I
mean - Diedre had really —</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Be quiet, Jerry. come with me,
darling.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You hold on tight as you want.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: You came. I’m your Aunt Carlotta, my
dear.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I want to see my mother. Where is she…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: In the coffin, my dear. where else…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Hush up, now. all of you. Deedee’s little
girl is here. All the way from San Francisco. Give her some peace with
her mother. Go on. Get a bourbon up in the front there. I said MOVE.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Bea - let go of the girl’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>the room</strong>: She is alone. Slow steps toward the
coffin. ROWAN halts. Standing above the coffin… Looking down…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Pull over!</p>
<p><strong>angle - michael in the backseat of the taxi</strong>: He
leans to the window and stares at the house, seized with melancholy. The
CABBIE pulls over.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: They - they let it. die. God, I loved this
house. Used to walk by, rattle a stick across tbe fence…</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Meter’s running, mister.</p>
<p><strong>michael walks to the gate</strong>: Runs his finger across it
and grins. On the other side, blood-red camellia blossoms lie in the
grass. He kneels, reaches in and gathers up a few. The rest skirt away
in a sudden BREEZE. He rises - and comes face to face with ‘The Man’ -
standing on the other side of the fence - smiling faintly in his
Victorian clothes.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Down here. darling, we figure: If you’re
taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a
going-away party.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: In certain cases, hell is the operative
word.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Giff - shuttup. you’re mother was a sweet
child, Rowan… A lost little girl in a world too full at things</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Rowan - we’re glad you’re with us now.
Carlotta has always done what’s best for the family. We don’t always
understand, but she’s the anchor. Anchors are hard and blunt by nature
-</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: - and they hurt like hell if they fall on
you.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Gif-ford</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ve been lied to my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>a beautiful maogany and marble parlor</strong>: where the
white-suited AARON LIGHTNER sits on a lush leather sofa, staring
benignly, ivory walking stick at his side.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: How do you feel, Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m Aaron Lightner - and this is the
Talamasca Retreat in New Orleans.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Tal - a - mas - ca. From the French.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was you - on the sidewalk…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus I’ve got - to get to the ho–</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Rowan’s already called the hotel, Michael. At
the cemetery by now, I would guess.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How do you know about Rowan …? I didn’t —
Cemetery…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: With her family. Rowan’s mother died
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rowan’s mother died at childbirth. And she
doesn’t have. any family.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: Lies, Michael. Desperate decptions. Rowan has
stepped into a world that’s waited centuries for her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You know what, mister…? You’re nuts. And
I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: We know about the visions, Michael…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: there is great danger…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I ask only that you stay here, long enough to
be - educated. A few hours.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You sound certifiable. Yon know that.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: Should I think you certifiable if you told me
that hours ago, you saw a phantom materialize before your eyes… I’ve
seen him too, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I - r saw him as a child. Lots of times…
But no one else did.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Come. There is a lot to read</p>
<p><strong>rowan and carlotta stand side by side</strong>: at the front
of the mourners before an enormous flower-laden crypt with twelve
vaults. carved into the top of the crypt is MAYFAIR - and NEVER DIE.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: She was alive all these years… You NEVER let
me know her. Who gave you that right…?!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: A Mayfair it ever I saw one.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!
you cut me off from every -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: I’m tired. I need to rest.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: There are things I have to know!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Come to the house tonight.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: All copies. but most are by the original
artists. Suzanne was the first.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne [in michael’s head]</strong>: Go back, Michael… do
what you can…</p>
<p><strong>deborah [in michael’s head]</strong>: Help us, Michael… The
door…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You’ve seen them…? when you drowned…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Gone…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: A nexus, Michael. Rowan - the visions - and
the Man… Lasher. I must know this now: Do you love Rowan…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The Talamasca is a world-wide… ahhh -
organization - but we do not - - ‘publicize.’ We observe and record… the
extraordinary. Since the Knights Templar…for eight hundred years A
history of the Mayfairs. Eyewitness accounts. The original handwritten
documents. From 1683 till now. I am the eighth observer of the
family.</p>
<p><strong>the mayfair history - volume one</strong>: BY PETYR VAN
ABEL</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Petyr Van Abel was the son of Jan van Abel -
a brilliant pioneer of genetics.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: But Petyr was a troubled soul, with
paranormal gifts. He renounced science, wandered for years, and met
Suzanne of Mayfair in Scotland. They fell in love, but she would not
marry. Petyr went to France - and soon joined the Talamasca.</p>
<p><strong>micael</strong>: You - you want me to read all this…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: No. If you trust me - if you can be strong –
I want you to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: A moon, but no stars. Clever.</p>
<p><strong>a patio that wraps around the outside of the house</strong>:
Two chairs. A table with an oil lamp, where CARLOTTA sits, the cat in
her lap. ROWAN sits. CREAK. Everything so old. CARLOTTA lights the lamp.
It makes her face an amber skull.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: The house is yours.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I don’t want the -</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Other properties as well - here and in
Europe. And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics. Liquid
funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All
yours now.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Eighty million doll — ?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: And this - if you decide to take the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: No, my dear. older than that. I’m
eighty-six - next month.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: That’s right Everything you think, Rowan.
Simply a matter of will and practice You’ll learn.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Why was I taken from my mother…?! And why
have I been deceived…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Come.</p>
<p><strong>wide of scene - the talamasca gallery</strong>: ARRON sits
beside MICHAEL at the desk. He places a syringe next to the open
manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: In case it becomes too powerful. I’ll be
right beside you, Michael</p>
<p><strong>ecu - the page petyr van able’s vo</strong>: Michael’s bare
hands come All that I feared is true - INTO FRAM and hover… the lady in
question is my His fingertips descend - Suzanne. And she is to be and
touch the page… burned at the stake as a witch… I was permitted to see
her in her cell…</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: You’ll have no confession from me!
Leave - - or I’ll turn your teeth into mushrooms!</p>
<p><strong>petyr</strong>: Suzanne - it is Petyr.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Oh my love… My sweet loving Petyr.</p>
<p><strong>petyr</strong>: I should never have left you. Never.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: But you are here now. All the years apart
are washed away.</p>
<p><strong>petyr</strong>: What have you done, Suzanne…? They say -</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: No! NOT what they say! The Baron was beyond
medicine. My - prayer was to save him, not kill</p>
<p><strong>petyr</strong>: Prayer…? Who did you pray to, my love…?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: They are already piling the sticks. There
is no time. But Petyr - you must know this now. I have a daughter… We
have a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>petyr</strong>: My God, Suzanne… where - where is -</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Across the sea in St. Domingue. Free from
the grasp of fearful men.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: It is good to have the one you 1ove with
you - when it is time to die. It will be a special day.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Marquerite. Your great-grandmother.
Something of a practitioner herself, Rowan.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Deborah, Suzanne’s daughter. She started
the family fortune. Her plantation covered half ot Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Julien. Your great grandfather. Clever,
charming Julien… we had our moments he and I… You are forever in his
debt.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: What is it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: The lamplight. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: You can see well in the dark, Rowan.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Better than most, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Put your hatred for me aside, so you can
clearly see what is ahead-</p>
<p><strong>ext. a seventeenth century town square. morning</strong>:
Encircled by shops. A stake at the center, sticks piled at its base. A
torch burns in a stanchion. A church spire towers above it all. PETYR is
among the large CROWD watching two columns of PRIESTS near the stake.
Between them is SUZANNE - in a white robe, holding a large candle. The
procession halts. She scans the crowd and finds PETYR. She smiles at
him. Then - her face turns fierce.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: I never did any of you harm! I am UNJUSTLY
CONDEMNED! I have no love for Satan!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Witch, is it…?! Come now, Lasher! COME!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: My beautiful Lasher - strike down those who
would come to see me die!</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Where is she…?! FIND HER!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Petyr!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne is high up on the church parapet</strong>: She leaps
off - flying down, robe rippling in the stort and crashes down atop the
Priest. PETYR - tears flowing - kneels at her broken body - and gently
takes her hand in his.</p>
<p><strong>a man’s voice</strong>: Petyr Van Abel…!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: This was her room.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: My god…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You kept her in this filth in
restraints…?.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: She didn’t feel them</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re a monster.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Antha…your grandmother…her life ended
there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Why are you doing this…? Handing out these
horrors! Why…?!!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: You have the Mayfair eyes. Tell me, Rowan
— what have those eyes seen that the mind can’t fathom…?</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: He’s shown himself to you… on the deck. In
the storm.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: ‘He’…?</p>
<p><strong>calotta</strong>: And on the plane - he touched you!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Lasher touched you and you loved it.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It wes a dream…!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Just like your mother - and all the others
that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Witches. Rowan. that is what we are.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: ENOUGH!!!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Ahhh… You are strong.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Save your anger for him! Let it keep you
strong - as I have I’ve fought his all my life… used my power and anger
to turn him away! Diedre was not so strong. That is why I kept your
mother a morphined, mindless shadow.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: And that is why I pushed your grandmother
onto the stones - even as she had him inside her…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re mad! Your mind is sick!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: …and why I put thirty years between you
and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy! you are the sum of his
desires -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You - are - a - murderer.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: But I had to use my hands. None before you
could kill with their mind. Graham, my dear. Your uncle…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No! You’re wrong! you’re wrong!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: Did you like it…? Looking down at Graham
and knowing what you could do…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m NOT like you! I’m NOT! You’re cruel -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: - twisted - - vicious ! You vile, old -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Oh my god… I - I — Are you alright…?
Carlotta…? Carlotta!!</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: You’re more dangerous than I knew… You’re
strength will make him more than he has ever been. I should have killed
you.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU WHEN YOU WHERE
BORN!!!</p>
<p><strong>on the first floor landing - at tne bottom of the
stairs</strong>: ROWAN freezes in her tracks at the sounds.</p>
<p><strong>back on the second floor</strong>: A gust of WIND whips at
CARLOTTA’S dress. She grabs the bannister for support. A piercing
WHISTLE in the WIND. CARLOTTA winces. Grabs her head. The cat MEOWS.</p>
<p><strong>carlotta</strong>: So it’s now- when I’m weakened.. you
wretched obscenity…</p>
<p><strong>on the first floor landing - the bottom of the
stairs</strong>: ROWAN is frozen. KATUNK-KATUNK-KATUNK… - out of the
DARK, CARLOTTA tumbles down the stairs to ROWAN’S feet.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re here.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I know you’re here. You killed her, didn’t
you… Come out, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>the living room</strong>: Dust and decay. Cracked leather
chairs. A chadelier of a hundred cut-glass pieces. Does it sway
slightly…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What did she call you — Lasher…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What are you…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What is it…?! Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: There’s something - someone — here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Where’s Carlotta…?</p>
<p><strong>the dark hall</strong>: and down to the foot of the stairs.
There lies CARLOTTA. MICHAEL stares drop-jawed.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus christ… was it — a man…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But how did - how could you —</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael…!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You know…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I know. It’s not possible — but I know.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: She - she said I - I was a —</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: - a witch.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: A whole town…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It could’ve been a tornado - or a - a
hurricane. Maybe -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - I saw him! Twice! Carlotta said I —
killed Graham - with - with my anger.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ro - you can’t really believe that. Nobody
can murder someone with their feelings. I mean — that’s CRAZY.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Is it more or less crazy than dying and
coming back to life with hands that can see…? God, Michael — what am
I…?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Likely a stroke. we all got used to
thinking she’d live forever. Well - she made it clear No ceremony, just
cremation. pause) Diedre. . now Carl… You get some sleep now. Both of
you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: C’mon. Let’s go to the ho—</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He’s in there! Or are you out for a stroll in
the garden …?! where are you, goddamnit…?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Even if it’s all true - that doesn’t make
you a witch! It’s 1992, Rowan!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But it scares the hell out of you, doesn’t
it. Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I - I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But look! LOOK! How can I do it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan is a hotel room</strong>: writhing in a bed. It is
MORNING. She screams -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: LOOK!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I had it again. I can’t save it - I don’t
know what to do…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Many times over the past thirty years. Why he
shows himself to me, I don’t know but Lasher’s not some mindless
wraith.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Then what is he…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: A spacial entity. An organized energy.
something that precedes our definition of existence.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A what…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: A spirit. Perhaps evil… …and he has come to
you- with Diedre gone - you’ve… inherited him.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Stop looking at me like that! I’m not some
siren chanting to the moon. And my life is not a cosmic whim! I am in
charge of my life - - and I want to stay. Everything that was taken from
me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.
Helpless. I should have been here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rowan… Think of what’s in that book. Think
of last night!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I am! And so are you. You thought you’d found
yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause) Michael, if you don’t want
-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Do you love me, Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes. I love you. Very much.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ve come home, Michae1, for the first time.
I want to stay here - with you.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Going away doesn’t mean you leave Lasher
behind. He was on Rowan’s deck - and the plane… geography seems
irrelevant now.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - you loved that house as a child.
You could work again! You could make it ours. We’ll sweep out the
horror. And Lasher with it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’d take mounths… and cost a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m soon to be a very wealthy witch.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What about your work back home…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: They need doctors in New Orleans too. Michael
- think what I could do with the money!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You really felt him - inside you…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It was like a dream. It wasn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: This is real.</p>
<p><strong>stu,</strong>: Didn’t I see this thing in psycho…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just call me Norman.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Well, Normie - you won’t have to worry about
this one being finished for a lonnnnng time. How are the hands…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The guy I told you about - Aaron…? He says
I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some
point.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.’
Didn’t your father ever teach you that…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: That’s a wasp. Fuckers’ll sting a tree if
they’re bored- so - where is she…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You found a nice doctor. Tank Gott. She makes a
nice living, Mikey…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If you like that type.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Rowan Mayfair.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Sut McKinley. Marry me.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I thought you were almost engaged, Stu…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You really love this guy…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He’s got great hands.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hey - I love gloves- I look really great in
gloves.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I like him. He can stay.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: These are the best guys around. Double up
on the carpenters. Let us examine the patient, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>angel - a tracking pov</strong>: from behind them - coming up
swiftly — BZZZZ-PTIT-BZZZZ-PTIT - and zipping past them and HOLD on a
DOORWAY as they arrive there. It is Diedre’s room. SILENCE. MICHAEL
sticks his head in.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is her room…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: The closest I’ll ever get to her…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Oh Michael, look!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ll bet she had a wonderful smile.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You sure…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It’s the next best thing to being there’ -
right…?</p>
<p><strong>int. diedre’s room [as if michael were there]</strong>: Forty
years of decay have vanished. DIEDRE - 7, in pink jumpers - on the floor
on her knees. She holds the marionette suspended by its slats.</p>
<p><strong>michael’s voice</strong>: She’s - she’ beautiful Ro. Can you
hear me…? she’s six, maybe seven. An ear to ear grin. Ro, she’s so -</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I love you.. .</p>
<p><strong>back to michael and rowan</strong>: as MICHAEL drops the
marionette. ROWAN darkens with concern.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m okay. Could you hear me…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She was the happiest mop-top you’ve ever
seen. With a wonderfnl smile.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Make way for the welcome wagon, darling.
We’re here to raise some hell.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in
this town, you’re shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your
life.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He made that quite clear, yes.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Gifford - that box glued to your
hands…?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Aren’t they gauche…? Those steel things
are so - common.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Nothing worse than a common tool.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: There he is!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Everyone - this is Michael curry.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hello..</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this
is her brother, Giff—</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Never mind them - you handsome, dirty man.
I’m going to tell you my darkeet secrets. then - if you can still speak
- you can tell me yours.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: The Mayfair women have always ruled the
roost. The men pour the bourbon - but the women buy it No one seems to
comp1ain though.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Wc all have our faults.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Deedee came home middle of freshman year —
pregnant. well — they sent for the father - your father… some assistant
professor…but he died in a car wreck on the way - near Nashville… You
didn’t know…?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Carl was set on an abortion - but Julien
wouldn’t hear of it. Quite a man, your great grandfather. He truly
adored Deedee. Truly. Day you were born. Carl announced Ellie was taking
you away. Julien had a fit. But Carl won. Life just swallowed Deedee up
after that.</p>
<p><strong>beataice</strong>: Listen, darling - I figure you hear it all
now, shed your tears, then you pour yourself a big drink of this life -
and bottoms up.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You two sees like a perfect fit. Only two
mounths…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mm-hmm. Seems &amp; lot longer.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: In the bayou, they have a saying… ‘You
choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.’
Darling, I’d say you’re on a roll.</p>
<p><strong>the plaza de arms</strong>: A large manicured park. A statue
- Andrew Jackson on a rearing-horse - stares down at them. MICHAEL seems
far away.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re thinking about him.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m wondering why the hell he hasn’t shown
up.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: He can’t hurt us, Michael. It’s us - our
love. He can’t find a crack in it. He can’t find a way in.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Maybe he’s just - waiting…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: If we married, we’d shut him out forever.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ro, how long have we known each other.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I don’t think of us that way - ever.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Either do I. I love you, Ro. You know that.
You’re a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Than letts get rnarried, Michael. I could put
a spell on you - and make you say yes.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: NO, I won’t marry you. Well, go on — do
your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: come clo-o-o-o-o-ser…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re a ve-ry bad witch, you know
that…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No, I’m ve-ry good — and you aught to
know.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Soon. We haven’t decided. A tew weeks…?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Wonderful! New Orleans air. It makes folks
want to mate.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We’d better get to work on the papers.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Papers…?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Standard for a Mayfair marriage. Rowan - there
is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be… aahhh… held
separate from the other party… Michael that is it’s in the will - for
centuries. Tradition enjoins, Rowan. of course, future earnings from
your practice will not fall into -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’ve decided not to open a practice here I
want to set up a research clinic. For infant genetic disorder.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s new territory for us…but yes, we can
look into that. Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could
-</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No tax shelters. No funding. I want to fund
the clinic - exclusively. The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic. I’d like
to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up
plans for new construction.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of
cash.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I plan on liquidating almost evetything.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: We’ll put something aside for me and Michael
- in both our names. The rest goes to the clinic.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: A toast: To the birth of a marriage - - and
the death of tradition.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: When I was six, r visited my mother in a
hospital ward - and the beating of hearts almost knocked me over. I
could feel the mechanisms of life, Michael - and it terrified me. The
Talamasca taught me how to find my center. That’s the first thing we
learn — all of us with gifts.</p>
<p><strong>jackson square</strong>: Artists doing portraits, fortune
tellers, clowns, jugglers. Soft jazz comes from behind shadowed,
filigreed balconies.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It’s about fear, Michael. Fear is the loss of
an anchor. You must find your place amongst everything. Then the fear
will leave - and then you can decide what gets in - and what
doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: There is a difference between sensing danger
- and being afraid. what defines you in the landscape, Michael…? what
anchors your life…? Your work…? Your creativity…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Rowan.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Then focus on how you feel about her. Because
your feelings define you. Take off your gloves, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Now - do you want to let anything in…? Then
don’t. Touch it. Michael.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey - I’m getting married in the morning -
I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’re just afraid I’ll drop dead before I
finish the damn house.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: And I thought I was the mindreader.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I took off my gloves today - with Aaron - -
and it was okay.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s GREAT!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Guess so. I keep thinking about the witches
- when I was… down there There was - caring. They saved me, Ro. They
said ‘go back’… Wel1- I came back - to you - to love you. I like seeing
it that way, y’know…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Why do I love when you do that. - -?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Aren’t we supposed to love somebody for their
moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Their what…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: So how come I love you most when you stick
your finger in your chin…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Wanna snack…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: A little wine…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I am with you. You yearn to know me - so I
am with you. you call me — and I love you all the more for that. I know
how the desert flower feels when it drinks of the rain.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You do not love Michael How can you love -
if you lie…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Lie…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: There are things you will not tell him.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael is healing. If I hide things from him
- it’s because love him.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Then you will lie to him about me - won’t
you…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice</strong>: You grow stronger…</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice</strong>: Can he make you feel as I do…?</p>
<p><strong>michael comes through the doorway</strong>: with a sandwich
and a glass of wine. And LASHER is gone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A chardonnay, mademoiselle - pleasantly
mild, but pretentious.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey - you’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Dropped it.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You okay…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just nervous. Getting married, you know.
Got the rings…?</p>
<p><strong>stu,</strong>: what rings…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get out of here. I’m gonna have my final
cigarette. I promised Ro I’d quit.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Always give the crovd a taste, darling.
Now - Ryan said I’m supposed to make sure -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: ‘The heir to the fortune must wear the
Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.’ We should all have to suffer such
burdens.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Then you wear it.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: C’mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair
tradition.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Nobody’s supposed to see the -</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: May I - come in…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: The most beautiful Mayfair of all.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: God bless this day, darling.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Thank you for this honor, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’ve been shadowing the family for thirty
years. It’s only fitting you give one af us away.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’ve grown very fond of you you and Michael
both.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Ah, the perfect touch. A blushing bride.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Then - in the eyes of God and his
creations, you are husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Turn over a rich southern family and you
find wackos - right..? Well, with the Mayfairs, more than one wanted to
be a witch. Yup. A witch.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You babbling that nonsense - now…? This is
a wedding.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: I’m not saying I believe it…but I heard it
‘nough times to know somebody did. They made a deal with the devil.
Y’know - “make us rich” - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.
And some stuff about ’bringing them all back through a door…’</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Gifford Mayfair - I’ll cook your tongue on
a spit! witches!</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Hell - Julien believed it… Carlotta too…
and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Ever taken a good look at the
portraits…?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: See that…?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Every one of ’em - in front of one of those
doors. See…? They believed it!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: eyes the paintings - and takes MICHAEL’S hand
in hers.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: A toast to Rowan and Michael. May they
always drink of love and always love to drink!</p>
<p><strong>from behind him - a tracking shot</strong>: zooms up and past
him - BZZZZZ-KPIT… And he walks into</p>
<p><strong>diedre’s room</strong>: New studs and sheetrock are up- The
cat wanders in.</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Ahh, Deedee. Fewer and fewer of us left
now, hmm…? what happens to the stories when we’re all gone…?</p>
<p><strong>gifford</strong>: Two hundred bucks for a saw…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Yes - I do trust you.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: Your powers are growing. Rowan. I wasn’t even
that focused.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I have seen him again. Last night.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: But you’ve not told Michael.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Gifford…?!! You seen my big-mouthed drunk
of a brother…? Probably stumbling home, propositioning the fire
hydrants. Safe trip, darling. And don’t forget to put on the ‘Do Not
Disturb’ sign.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Lasher will act, Rowan. Whatever it is he
wants - he’s waited three hundred years to have it. facing him alone… I
don’t like -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Lasher is my legacy - not Michael’s. Aaron,
I’ve seen the pain in Michael. I can’t bear to see anymore. He’s not to
know. Swear to me.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Aaron - I really could protect him - if…it I
had to.</p>
<p><strong>inside the car</strong>: ROWAN is at the wheel, with MICHAEL
beside her.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m going back someday, come what may - to
Blue Bayou. where the -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: ‘My pappy said ’Girl. don’t let the man git
ya - and do what he done to me - caus. he’ll git ya! Born on a bayou,
Bhorn on a byyyyy-yooooo!’</p>
<p><strong>int. the newlyweds’ hotel room. that night</strong>: MICHAEL,
in silk pajama slacks, and his gloves, sits on the edge ot the bed-
ROWAN stands before him in a sheer robe. Cool, seductive. She unties the
robe’s sash, and it slips to the floor. The moonlight washes over her
body.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m yours now - completely… I want your
touch. Try, Michael. Don’t let anything else in.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Yes, Michael. Harder–. More…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Like this…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I am with you, my love. Like no other can
ever be.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Nooo… NO! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: God, no! Oh god….</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Like no other…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: STOP!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Always loved you..</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hi. I’m Michael curry. your husband…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No. Not - not now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: When you get married, I thought the sex
stopped after the honeymoon…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: opens an eye, listening to him leave. she
closes her eyes…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You look a little green.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mm-hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mm-hmm…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: So - you like your portrait…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Gee - look at that. I didn’t know
alligators came this far up on shore</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Mm-hmm…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Alligator…?</p>
<p><strong>inside the car</strong>: MICHAEL and ROWAN wait for service.
He honks the horn.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Everybody must be out back sacrificing a
virgin to the crocodile god.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Excuse me.. I’m trying to find -</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Jesus stopped here once - for
directions.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Gator got him nice, huh mister…?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Jesus St. Cracker! Look at that
beauty!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We on the right road to the Cajun
Kitchen…?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: See ya later. boys Y’know, I buy American
- every time. Hell, it’s the right thing to do but nobody ever built a
car like them Nazis. keep going two miles Kitchen’s on the left.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Nobody makes a car like them Nasis…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you see the old man on the —</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael!</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: You two lovebirds wanna step outside…?</p>
<p><strong>man # 2</strong>: I’ll bet somebody owns a car like that
carries a let o’ cash.</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Yup. Lots.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s smart thinking. Tell me - which one
of you got to use the brain tonight…?</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Give me your wallet, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - give him the money!</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Now wasn’t that easy… ? You should try
harder at being a help, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>man # 2</strong>: That’s probably what she, says - “Try
harder, Michael.” Right. Sammy.</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Yeah. “Harder. Michael. Harder.”</p>
<p><strong>man # 2</strong>: That what you tell him, hon…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get your goddamn hands -</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Shit, Rollie - she give you a shock…?</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Rollie. . .? Hey, man…</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: Hey - what’s witb you, man…?</p>
<p><strong>man # 1</strong>: What the fuck’s going on…?! what’d you do
to him, lady…?!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Get in the car!! Rowan!!!</p>
<p><strong>inside the car</strong>: MICHAEL - freaked - driving like a
bat out of hell. ROWAN slumps in her seat, slowly coming back.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ!!! That was you,
wasn’t it…?! ROWAN! But it wasn’t like Graham - or Carlotta not blind
fury. This time you controlled it, didn’t You…?!!! Didn’t you…?!
ROWAN…?!! Goddamnit, ANSWER ME!!!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No - I didn’t kill him. Would you rather I’d
let them kill us - after they’d raped me…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No. This is unreal…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s not some fairytale in an old book.
Michael - look at me. I didn’t choose this, Michael. This is who I am. I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What are you doing here…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I - I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But look! LOOK! How can I do it…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan sudenly wakes in bed beside michael</strong>: she
tosses the sheets back - and stumbles into the BATHROOM. She closes the
door, kneels at the toilet — and vomits.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Fall in New Orleans… This whole town is
waterlogged! The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s cause we’re below sea level.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ROWAN we’re below sea level. I’ve spent
time there myself.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ’I left my heart in Ran Sanfisco…</p>
<p><strong>a flame</strong>: suddenly flicks out from the logs.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: intensitiet her stare and — the logs bursts
into flame. She grins to herself - and buries her nose in her book.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Ro, what do you think about - about
spending Thanksgiving back in -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You did that, didn’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Talking to me dear…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Remember the first time we made love - and
then —</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: - we made a fire.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Stop doing that! If I’ve something to say,
let me say it - out loud.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How can you say it isn’t true…? We’re not
the same. Not like we used to be. You’re changing - all the time..</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - what made you fall in love with
me…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Your beneficence.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m serious. Whatever it was - it’s still
there inside me, isn’t it - change and all…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just do me a favor. Don’t start anymore
fires - or turn on the lights by blinking - or cook with your hands
behind your -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: What the hall are you -</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I love you more than anything in the world,
Michael. More than anything.</p>
<p><strong>ext. the mayfair mansion. day - a week later</strong>:
MICHAEL AND STU are high up on ladders fitting and hammering copper
flashing along the eaves. They don’t see ROWAN come through the gate and
up the walk.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘There is a house in xew Orleans…’</p>
<p><strong>michael &amp; stu</strong>: ‘…they call the Rising Sun…’</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I thought it was ’whistle while you work.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Is that a crack about our singing…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Is that what you were doing…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael, I spoke to the geneticist from
Stanford, and she -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Goddamn sonuvabitch!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You alright…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: A little sore. Darm… Finish up my section,
will ya…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You were saying…?</p>
<p><strong>above them - stu pounds the flashing</strong>: WHACK!
something drops free from beneath the eaves - grey, round - like a huge
melon with ridges - landing in front of him on the gutter. BZZZZZZZ…
Two, black antennae wiggle out of a crack in the sphere…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Is he - is he gonna die…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Lock the door. Lock it</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It was an accident. Michael - there isn’t a
house in New Orleans this old that doesn’t have a wasp’s nest
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You changed him, Rowan. You went right down
to each cell - and changed him.</p>
<p><strong>the garden</strong>: She stares at the sky. There is a bright
moon, but no stars.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: ‘A moon, but no stars…’</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: The wasps were meant for Michael - but
there’s only so much you can control, isn’t there? The great and
powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-.. Why would you hurt him…?!
Answer me.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I 1ove you, Rowan. I’ve always loved you. I
only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts -
so I could be as we are now.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: YOU VIOLATED ME!!! ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Explain this to me — violated…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You bastard…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I made it for you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Made it…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: It is from love.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: To love, you must be able to feel.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: If you knew how I yearn for that…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: If I could feel like you feel…but I have
only others’ feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me. Things to
be felt, yes — but not nine to feel…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It you harm Michael, I will let my anger
loose. And you will feel that. Do you understand…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You’re very clever, aren’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I am only what you are — what all of you
have been. what do you think of yourself now, my love…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: How much of it is me - alone and how much is
you…? Lasher — what do you want…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice!</strong>: I love the room, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>the marionette</strong>: Michael - you’ve forgotten your
gloves. Better off with them on, don’t you think…? Here…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What’re you drawing…?</p>
<p><strong>michael is standing frozen at the window</strong>: pad and
pencil still in his hand. ROWAN comes INTO FRAME. He turns - in the
ozone. She looks at the pad. He has sketched the marionette, dangling
from a disembodied hand.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That’s really good. I have to go mleet Bea
for lunch now. I feel so had for her- There’s still no word on Gifford-
she’s a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Give her my best.</p>
<p><strong>rowan and beatrice sit in an open patio cafe</strong>:
BEATRICE has a beer and a huge plate of oysterts. Chewing, she points at
the plate. ROWAN shakes her head NO.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: That food poisoning did a job on me.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: I told you not to honeymoon in the Bayou.
I remember when Giff ate a bad batch of —</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m sure he’s alright, Bea. They’ll find him
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: It’s over a month. The police say it
happens all the time.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Isn’t that your friend…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Aaron!</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: The Ladies Mayfair. Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Are you alright…? You look pale.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I wish everyone would stop commenting on my
health. I’m the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: There are two.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Two what…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Two heartbeats.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Excuse me…?</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Are you sure…?</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: What are you two talking about…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Rowan - is pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: But how could - how can you possibly —
?</p>
<p><strong>close-up - a bush with large emerald-green flowers</strong>:
has bloomed. Extraordinary, exotic, bizarre. OC - joyful LAUGHTER. PAN
TO</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: whirling ROWAN round in his arms. Both of
them grinning and laughing. And he smothers her with a deep kiss..</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: If it’s a boy — Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: A bit much. Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named
Lucas. Grayson.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Where are you gitting these…? Aaron — if it’s
a boy.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: And if it’s a girl — Diedre.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I’m going to have a baby. Michael wants to
name it after you - if it’s a girl. Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh…?
Funny — I never really thought I’d ever —</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I bring her flowers too.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: There is no one here but the dead.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Go away! I don’t want you here.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: If that were true, I would not be here.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s very dangerous to assume you know what a
woman wants.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: From the night on the moor, when I was swept
into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who
has wanted me! suzann. and Deborah. Stella - Marguerite - Antha - Diedre
- All of them. And you will have a child…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: A girl…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s too soon to know.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You fear me. Why when you yearn so to know
me…? You want more from me than the pleasure. Much more.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: you crave what I might show you. What you
can learn. What I can give you. So much more than Michael can.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What Michael gives me is stronger than
anything you could ever inderstand.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: But I could understand. I want to
understand!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I LOVE him!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Do not tell me that!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I LOVE MICHAEL. MICHAEL!!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Lasher…? Lasher…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice</strong>: Michael will look like this one day…
… but not I.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: To the next Mayfair: Diedre - or —
Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Anymore of this…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: I - uh - I assume either one’s middle name is
gonna be Stu…</p>
<p><strong>michael walks down the hallway past the portraits.</strong>:
Passing the mirror, he stops - and cocks his head. The glass is turning
GREEN. He raises a finger and touches the glass. His finger punctures
the GREENNESS - and sinks in up to his knuckle. Re hesitates - and
slowIy, draws his finger out..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Michael… Do what you can.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Michael… Help us… The door!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Michael… Michael… look at me!</p>
<p><strong>michael is on the floor in the hall</strong>: AARON is
kneeling, grasping him by the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Focus, Michael</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It was them.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Don’t tell Rowan about this.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Michael, Rowan should -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: NO! she’s pregnant, Aaron. she’s got that
to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this. don’t you
think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me… Listening to my
heart, aren’t you…? The Timex still ticking…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan and lasher standing at a corner lab table</strong>: A
single candle flickers. She holds a closed, long-stemted rose in her
hand. LASHER’S transparent hand reaches out and melts into bars. ROWAN
shivers from the union.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Imagine The sun. It is morning. It rises.
The light wrashes over you. It warms you.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Now, Rowan. Give me the sun.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ‘It was the best of times. It was the worst
of times…’</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Now, my love — see it as It was.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: See the memory of life!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You see…? You see…?!! Rowan think what the
child might do…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I - AM - STANDING - IN - THE -
BATHROOM!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael and stu on the side porch</strong>: sipping coffee.
MICHAEI has a distracted frown…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: …Donna’s gonna meet me in Key West, so I’ll
leave here a week before Christmas and be back on the fourth. Okay…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What’s wrong, Mike…?</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: C’mon - you haven’t been able to lie to me
since you asked Martha Rutledge out behind my back in tenth grade.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’m getting — left behind.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Left behind…? This about Rowan…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yes. Partly. It’s - it’s - Stu - do you
believe in —</p>
<p><strong>rowan stands in the porch entrance behind them</strong>:
Stock still. Pale. Drawn. She’s been listening.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Hi there. Want coffee…?</p>
<p><strong>angle - the swimming pool</strong>: where a WORKER - up on a
ladder - stares down, frowning at the can of sealant that has fallen. -
its thick, blue-green contents spreading out on the bottom of the
pool…</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: What now…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: When aid you get home last night…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: What were you talking about…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yyou look terrible. You’re exhausted. You
practically live at the goddamn clinic. Even pregnant women who aren’t
doctors know that You can’t -</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mike! Better c’mere!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: It cracked the bottom. Stuff’s seeping down
through a crack.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Careful…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Somebody built a kind ot room down
here.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hey - gimme a hand!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dovetails. Gotta be a hundred years
old.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Something’s wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Nothing is wrong with me. I know something’s
in there - and so do you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael — look.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Marguerite…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Marguerite! Carlotta said - “Margutrite was
something of a practitioner herself.” She meant - like a doctor — Like
—</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael — no!</p>
<p><strong>marguerite</strong>: Now, my love - Now!</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice</strong>: I am here, Marguerite! I can
see!</p>
<p><strong>lasher’s voice</strong>: No…NO pleeeeease… I am going…
slipping… The feeling… Oh, the feeling! NOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>back to rowan and michael</strong>: MICHAEL drops the head.
It breaks like a rotten melon. He is horror-stricken, wiping his hands
frantically on his shirt…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He went into the dead! Saw with their eyes
- used them…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This one!</p>
<p><strong>lasher voice</strong>: Marguerit. - I can feel you…</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Faster, Marguerite! Faster! FASTER!</p>
<p><strong>back to rowan and michael</strong>: MICHAEL still holds the
skull, eye to eye.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Jesus - he tried to fuck her and Julien -
Julien was there - like, like an overseer…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What have the witches always asked of
you…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: “Go back, Michael. Do what you can…”</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Yes - and you have. Do you see…? He was
passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one
person they knew had the power to save him… and they gave him the power
to show you what no one else could…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: With his hands!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But why would they do that…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: To warn you.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: You’ve always said you felt goodness in them
- that the witches brought you and Rowan together. Isn’t that right…?
They’re reaching out to you, Rowan!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But it doesn’t make sense. They - they used
Lasher… they conspired with him.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Who can say the hope of redemption dies with
our last breath…? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre,
withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and
blood… surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might
lead in Lashers grasp… Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil
they embraced in life…?!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It feels right. There is a continuum, Rowan.
You’re part of them. They want you to stop Lasher.</p>
<p><strong>rowan in a windowless room at the research clinic</strong>:
as she extracts a chunk of flesh. She prepares a slide specimen, placing
it under a large microscope. She depotits a specimen in a centrifuge and
turns it on. WHIRRRR… she programs the computer - and co1umns of figures
and symbols start filling the monitor. She eyes the Screen and -
LASHER’S spectral face appears within the glass.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: And now - do you know…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I know that you’re evil.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I only wanted to see as others do… feel as
others do… …but Marguerite could not help me. Nor Julien…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: And now you expect me to stockpile corpses
for you…?!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: No, my love. I want nothing more of the
dead. I want you to — chang me.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I have kept this from you, until now. You
had to learn the magnificence of your powers first. You had to see for
yourself what you are capable of. Think. Rowan - think of the rose - and
the fire - and Stu. You gave Michael life again - you give life to the
ehild within you… Give me life! Make me flesh!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s impossible. You want me to - to make you
into something you’re not! You - you have no substance - you have no
cells, no structure…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I’ve waited for you - the one whose science
could match her powers… Do you know what it’s like - to sense the
majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach…? to float in a
dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.? I did not
choose to be such as this! Suzanne brought me here. She called to
me!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But have I…? Ever…?!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Not with your voice, no…but you do not need
a voice for me. Only the beat of your heart. That is your voice to me
—</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: — and I have heard you from the beginning…
from it’s very first beat.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I love Michael…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Then help me— for his sake…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You mustn’t hurt him. Mustn’t - mustn’t
hurt..</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it
is done. Only me…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Only you…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Change me, Rowan, and we can change
everything…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Lasher…? Lasher! Come to me!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You can’t. You use yourself up in the
passion. You need time.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Maybe Aaron is right. Maybe they are trying
to help. Can you feel them…? I swear to you - you will never know him.
When you come into the world, he will be gone. This is my promise to
you.</p>
<p><strong>the garden</strong>: where the emerald bush is blooming again
- small, crimson buds sprouting from the center at the bright green
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>michael and stu on the sidewalk</strong>: Standing beside a
taxi. STU rubs his hands together.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: A few hours and I’ll be wasting away in
Margaritaville. Oh, sweet decadance.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Just don’t fall off any ladders.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.
I mean - hell, they’re all crazy anyway - right…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Comes running out the front door - down the
walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool. Aloof.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I almost missed you. You have a great time -
and a merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>stu</strong>: You two be good to each other.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: God, Michael - it’s so beautiful. It’ll be
weird without anybody tromping around in there, huh…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Hi. You - you wanna get some breakfast…?
Maybe see a movie…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I - I… I can’t, Michael. There’s stuff — at
the clinic -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Gotcha.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael -</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Go on. Rowan. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: What is wrong…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Wrong…? Science is not magic.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I do not understand…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You went into the cells — and you changed
them. How…?!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: There was no thought. There was no act. That
is not what I am.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I don’t know what you are!!!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: That is what you must discover. see what I
am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Do not be atraid. Fear is not for you…</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s pov - a trillion flecks of colored light</strong>:
Dense, dazzling. The POV moves deeper - the density lessens…fewer
particles, frenzied, darting in a greenish haze… Deeper - terrifying
speed now - zooming, plummeting toward nothingness. OBLIVION -a piercing
SCREAM-</p>
<p><strong>rowan - suspended in the air with lasher</strong>: SCREAMS -
lurches free of him, and falls to the floor, dazed. LASHER swoops down
to her, enfolding her gently.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Tell me what I am, Rowan.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Rowan… Rowan!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You are thinking of him…</p>
<p><strong>rowas</strong>: Michael…? Michael…?!</p>
<p><strong>rowan’s pov - the living room</strong>: where a magnificent
Christmas tree rises to the ceiling, covered with globes and stars and
tinsel so the whole room seems to shine.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: walks slowly toward it - overwhelmed, tears
filling her eyes</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Nice, huh…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You’ve gone away from me, Ro… Someplace I
don’t know how to get to.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: It’s not true. You have to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I want us to leave. This isn’t home, Rowan.
I could tear the house down and start from scratch - and it still
wouldn’t be home. I want to go back to San Francisco - I want our child
born somewhere that’s free of death. That’s all there is here! It’s in
the ground and the glass and the steel and the ground. I want to leave.
If Lasher follows, So be it. Let him face us in a place where we
belong!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: That’s not good enough. Why not…?!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I can’t leave now. Don’t ask me to explain! I
just can’t!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ve never asked you to explain yourself -
because you used to let me inside! But I’m on the outside now… you put
me there!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - please - just. a little longer.
Don’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why bother to ask, Ro…? Why don’t you just
make me stay,..?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: How ’bout a backward hex with a
three-quarter twist…?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You could kill me - right now, couldn’t
you…? couldn’t you…?! Tell me the truth — is it Lasher…? Answer me!!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Michael - I’m sorry… Just give me -</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: When you’re ready to let me back into your
heart, I’l1 come back to you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: MICHAEL!!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You are magnificent, my love.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: on’t know what else to do. Maybe I just
don’t belong in her life. well - I’m already out of her life.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Nothing was ever more false.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Then tell me. Is it Lasher….</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I only know she loves you - desperately.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I’ll probably be back in a week…but I can’t
spend Christmas in that house. you’ll check on her - every day…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Every day twice.</p>
<p><strong>michail</strong>: Aaron - do you believe in God…?</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: I believe we all come from the same force…
Even Lasher.</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: Be we11, Michael. Be strong.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: On the hill. 2712 Fairmont.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I left my heart in —</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: drops the helmet - as if burned - and races
out.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Pick up the fucking phone, Ro!</p>
<p><strong>arron</strong>: Michael…?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Aaron - lieten to me… It’s been Lasher -
from the start!</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: What are you talk—</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He chose ME for ROWAN — when I was a
child!</p>
<p><strong>back to rowan in the mansion</strong>: on the second floor,
outside Diedre’s room. BZZZ-KPIT… rt’s in there. She walks inside.
BZZZ-KPIT….</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Carlotta was too strong for Lasher. She got
Rowan away from him - to San Francisco… but that took her away from me,
too! Aaron - Lasher killed my father! That’s what got me and mother out
of New Orleans - and back to Rowan - so we would meet! Aaron his power.
. . His control…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Rowan…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: You have to warn her - this second! I’m
catching the next flight back!</p>
<p><strong>back to rowan in diedre’s room</strong>: staring at a
sheetrock wall - all senses primed. BZZZ-KPIT. suddenly, she SMASHES her
fist through - and starts tearing the wall away. Ripping the last chunk
away - and there sits</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Petyr van Abel would have been proud of your
devotion, Aaron…. your compassion. And I am grateful for them.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: The Talamasca’s histories made Rowan’s
nature clear to her in a way I never could… and I am thanktul for
that.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: That is our purpose in all this…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Since the begxnning We have been together a
long time, you and I. And now it ends…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Rowan fights her feelings for me, but her
passion - her power - they conspire against her love. And I grow
stronger. -</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: But there are still limits to your powers,
aren’t there…? Some of us are without desire - and we exhaust you —
don’t we…?</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’rn right in the middle of the road! There’s
nothing wrong with the car!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Yes…? Let us wait and see…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I’m not afraid, Lasher…</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: I am not AFRAID!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You are strong, Aaron… …but others are not
so strong.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: Lasher, where are you…? Lasher…?! LASHER!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: If not for yourself then fear for the
children…</p>
<p><strong>back to the cliffside - same time</strong>: AARON’S car
tumbles down through the air, hits bottom - and EXPLODES in a
fireball.</p>
<p><strong>back to rowan at the bottom of the stairs</strong>: as she is
sent reeling to the floor. Dazed, fighting a blackout. - sliding down
into her dream…</p>
<p><strong>the operating room in rowan’s dream</strong>: ROWAN works
feverishly on the OUT OF FRAME patient. THE MASKED FIGURES watch
silently.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I - I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: But look! LOOK! How can I do it…?</p>
<p><strong>masked figure</strong>: Go on! Help him!</p>
<p><strong>masked figure</strong>: Help us!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: HOW…?!</p>
<p><strong>julien</strong>: Help him! You were made for this?</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: I can’t do it! How can I do it…?!</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Stop doubting your power!!</p>
<p><strong>masked figure</strong>: No! Don’t listen to your words,
Rowan. Listen to the feeling behind your words. Listen to your
heart.</p>
<p><strong>aaron</strong>: It is not your power that you doubt. When you
say - “I can’t do it” - you are saying - “I MUST NOT DO IT!” You are
saying “I WILL NOT DO IT!” This is what your heart tells you.</p>
<p><strong>rowan on the floor at the foot of the stairs</strong>: coming
groggily out of the dream. She rises unsteadily. And LASHER stands
before her. Her face hardens. He starts toward her. ROWAN stands her
ground - sensing danger.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: STOP!’</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Aaron was in the dream. A dream tilled with
spirits. you killed him, didn’t you…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: It was an accident. Gifford, too.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: The portraits, Lasher. Why are the witches
always before a door…? Tell me, Lasher. Now!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: They want to come back. We have a pact - of
mutual desire and consent. The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry. I have
weaved you all together - from the start. I brought Petyr Van Abel to
Suzanne. He had genius in him. Scientific, precise. It was a perfect
start. And on it has gone - father to mother… sister to brother… father
to daughter…</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Oh god…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Ju1ien was your father Your
great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the
same… That is why he fought carlotta for your life.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: The Mayfair pact. Rowan: when I am flesh - I
will unlock the door - and the witches will come through. You are the
key to the door for the witches - and for me! You are the thirteenth
witch.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I will be — perfect. That is why I chose
Michael…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: The boy who would turn his dreams into
reality. The exquisite imagination! So aesthetic, so vulnerable… The boy
so special, he could see me! And I knew he was the one — for us. You
thought it love at first sight…? I chose him for you. The union is human
perfection.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: I created you to create me — and you
have…</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: It’s growing inside you… Waiting to change…
Waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: Did you think you could trick me, my
love…?</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: You thought I could not see into your soul…?
I made your soul!</p>
<p><strong>lasher</strong>: It is Christmas Eve, my love The witching
hour is at hand, when Christ was born into the world - when the Word was
finally made Flesh — and I would be born too. I am done with
waiting!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Oh god - oh my god - no, godddd, NO!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ROWAN!! ROWAN!!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: ROWAN!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ther figure</strong>: slowly turns round. it is a man -
delicate yet muscular but the skin, the expression, the texture ot him
is brand-new, newborn. And his face is a perfect mix of ROWAN and
MICHAEL. In his hand, he holds one at the newly-bloomed
emerald-and-crimson flowers. He smiles…</p>
<p><strong>the man</strong>: I made these.</p>
<p><strong>lasher the man</strong>: Ahhh… It is incredible, is it not…?

<p><strong>rowan comes carwling out of the house</strong>: - weakened,
haggard, bloodied, pale.</p>

<p><strong>rowan</strong>: No! Don’t! Lasher!!!</p>
<p><strong>michael sinks like a stone beneath the water</strong>:
Sinking into death for the second and last time. And - the WITCHES seep
out in the water surrounding him.</p>

door and bring us back- Goodbye, Michael. Let go now. Let go…</p>
<p><strong>back at poolside</strong>: LASHER stands, beaming and proud,
staring into the water. ROWAN drags herself to the pool - and stares
down in horror.</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Oh god nooooooooo….</p>
<p><strong>lasher the man</strong>: Mother - you must rest. You’re still
bleeding. Rest. please…</p>

<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Lasher - please…! Save us! Bring us

<p><strong>lasher the man</strong>: BE GONE! - or I will send you where
there are no worlds at all! GO!</p>
<p><strong>rowan</strong>: Let me go… Michaelllllll…</p>
<p><strong>lasher the man</strong>: ENOUGH! He is dead. You are here for
