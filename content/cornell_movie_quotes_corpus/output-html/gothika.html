<p><strong>revised second draft</strong>: December 8, 2002</p>
<p><strong>int. gym swimming pool - morning</strong>: Miranda slides
through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes
us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound.
Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on
autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap
stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience:
flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a
towel.</p>
<p><strong>int. coffeehouse - morning</strong>: Miranda pays for a pair
of coffees and a newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>int. kitchen - morning</strong>: Miranda’s husband DOUGLAS
GREY serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to
studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the
newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It’s 8:00 AM.</p>
<p><strong>ext. st. anne’s high school parking lot - morning</strong>:
Miranda’s Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his
wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting
him up as Miranda drives off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - on a surveillance monitor</strong>:
Miranda’s car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the
car drives past we read the plate on the wall:</p>
<p><strong>“woodward forensic institute”</strong>: The gate shuts behind
her with a certain finality as we…</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward institute - miranda’s office -
evening</strong>: Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the
according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young
mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to
provoke. Mid-session:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: This is your stepfather who came to visit
you?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: My stepfather? No. He’s dead. I killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s the first time you admit it.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: So? There’s a first time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It means you’re finally past the denial
stage. This is good, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I never killed anyone who didn’t deserve
it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You only killed your stepfather as far as I
know.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I should’ve taken care of my mother. She knew
all along. You remind me of her.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I remind you of your mother?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Always so put together. Like you iron your
underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the
bread of the –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Let’s get back to your visitor last
night.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: The Devil.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil
visit you? It’s already hell in here, what would he have to gain?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: He came to fuck an angel. I’m his dirty
angel.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: He grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him
and usually I love that, I just do – maybe you can tell me why I love it
so much – but not this time, he was just too rough –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s it until Monday. Try and get some
sleep tonight, okay?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Sure, Doctor. Crazy people hear messages from
God. Not the Devil. You know that, right?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I didn’t say you were crazy.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You don’t have to say it.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward corridor - later</strong>: Miranda locks her
office, armed with paperwork. The end of another workweek. DR. PETE
GRAHAM, a good ten years older and Miranda’s best friend on the job,
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Dr. Grey.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Dr. Graham.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Power went out again in our wing.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of
the dark, you know?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re not shrink appropriate and you’re
about to get promoted. Everybody’s afraid of something.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What am I afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yourself. At least you should be. What are
you up to this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Write a little country music, decline invites
to grand social events, drink myself to sleep – the usual. You?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Doug wants to look at some Real Estate up
at Willow’s Creek.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: He thinks it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: So is golfing, I’m told. Who was your six
o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Chloe McGrath – talk about trying to empty
the ocean with a tea cup. She’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I hear Manhattan’s full of them.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Don’t start with that. I already turned
down the job. We’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Good girl.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that
dinner with you and Doug. Are you free tonight?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: He’s stuck at a school board meeting.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: You’ve been here a year already, Dorothy’s
starting to take this personal. How’s next Wednesday?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Next Wednesday it is, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - night</strong>: Miranda drives off,
leaving the majestic grounds behind. A GUARD waves her off.</p>
<p><strong>ext. road - night</strong>: Miranda slows down at the sight
of colored lights up ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the
road. EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her down.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s car - moving - night</strong>: SHERIFF RYAN,
40’S, recognizes her and ambles over.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Anybody hurt, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Nah, telephone post just decided to
fall. It’ll take us a while to clear this up so I’m afraid you’re gonna
have to take the long way home, Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: And tell your husband he owes me a
phone call.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Will do. Wouldn’t want him in trouble with
the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: That a girl. The law never sleeps and
all that. You take care now.</p>
<p><strong>ext. old main road - night</strong>: Miranda drives down the
curvy road toward an old bridge. Something definitely creepy about this
deserted place –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s car - moving</strong>: Miranda dials a number
on her cell phone, gets the machine.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hi, it’s me. Are you there? Pick up, pick
up. I’m on my way but I just got detoured so I’m…</p>
<p><strong>pov through the windshield</strong>: A TEENAGE GIRL stands
smack in front of us. Naked. About to get pummelled by us.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Miranda swerves to avoid her and
slams into the railing. METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain
control of the car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT – She looks in her
rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. Drunk or high or in
any case completely out of it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Stay on the line. Don’t go anywhere. The
weirdest thing just – Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ashley bridge - night</strong>: Miranda cautiously
approaches the girl, who is now not moving. Just standing there. Her
back to us.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hello? Are you hurt? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Were you in an accident? Were you attacked?
It’s okay, I’m a doctor. My name is Miranda Grey…</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re in shock right now, that’s perfectly
natural. I’m going to get you to the hospital. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Don’t be scared. It’s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hands off me, okay? Tell me your name, do
you remember your name?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What are you doing? I’m trying to help you
–?!</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - dawn</strong>: Miranda wakes up in a cold
sweat. Just a bad dream. A beat. FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we
hear a REPETITIVE SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely
familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP. Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for
the glass of water on her bedside table. Except… it’s not there. She
turns to her husband but he’s not in the bed. And now she glances around
the room and realizes this is not her bedroom. She climbs off the bed
and walks in the dark. Trips over something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY.
Her heartbeat goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a small
opening in the door. A glass pane. She peers through the glass at the
empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she’s
inside a cell. She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic
–</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hello? Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - establishing - day</strong>: CAMERA
SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard. Now we spot the
source of our continuing THWIP THWIP sound: sprinklers watering the
impressively-kept gardens. The expansive complex is more Victorian
campus than drab prison, with separate wings , research units,
libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.</p>
<p><strong>int. female wing stairs</strong>: Pete rushes up two steps at
a time, passing by a NURSE WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as
he goes –</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway outside miranda’s cell</strong>: An ORDERLY
unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass pane he can see a visibly
upset Miranda arguing with the head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her
50’s: IRENE.</p>
<p><strong>orderly #1</strong>: Sleeping beauty is awake.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Peter, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: How do you think I feel? Is this a
joke?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Giving you something to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t need to calm down. What I need is
an explanation</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Just take this and we can sit down and
chat.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why here, why not in my office?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t want an anticonvulsant, at least
give me Valium.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Fifty milligrams.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Jesus Christ, you’re gonna knock me out?
Ten milligrams.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: How would you feel if you woke up in a
goddamn cell, dressed like this?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We can discuss it at length after you take
your meds.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Okay. This better be good.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - later</strong>: Miranda paces. Alone
with Pete, she is even more upset.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miranda, this is very awkward. Technically I
shouldn’t even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver
until you’re transferred. So whatever is said here won’t leave this
room. I won’t tell Parsons, I won’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I want to talk to my husband.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You can’t to that. Sit down, please. Try to
relax.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why would I pretend to be in any way
relaxed?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I understand you’re upset. But we need to put
some things in order.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Two massive understatements.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What is this? Why are you doing this to
me?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Just answer the question. Humor me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I’m a
psychiatrist. I transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a
little over a year ago. My job entails dealing with a ward of
schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I don’t mean how long you’ve worked here, I
mean how long you’ve been staying here.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m a doctor, yes? Or was medical school
just an elaborate dream?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Of course you’re a doctor. A great doctor in
fact.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Pete, how long have I been here?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Five days.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You were admitted to the neurosurgical unit
seizing violently. That lasted three days. Scans revealed left-sided
weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. neurosurgical unit</strong>: Miranda seizing
violently FROM HER POV: Doctors struggling to contain her. Arms
thrashing, legs. FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a
cart, out of control.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You came out of it and tested negative for
PCP, underwent extensive hypnosis and received amytal injections.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Miranda being tied down. A nurse with a
syringe –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - continuous action</strong>: She looks
down at her wrists with the reddish marks.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You were tied down for a day and a half so you
wouldn’t hurt yourself and then you went into a state of, well – You’ve
been pretty much catatonic. This is the first time you speak.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Doug must be worried sick. I need to call
him –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You’re the most logical person I know, bar
none. Plus you have a photographic memory – unconfirmed, but you do
remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around. Why am I
telling you this?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re establishing my personality as
fairly intellectual, you don’t consider me impulsive or emotional.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And that’s a fair assessment, no?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes, that’s fair. And following this
pattern of analysis, we’re about to discuss a traumatic event that
rendered this psychological profile useless, correct?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Two hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You think I’m in denial. That I’m putting
on a brave show – that this is a ‘cover’ for some unbearable emotion I’m
hiding. Why?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Don’t analyze yourself, just focus on
remembering.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I remember Friday night after work, if you
say that was five days ago – Anyway, I asked you what you were doing for
the weekend and you said the usual and you made a joke about writing
country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and I told you I was going
to look at some real estate in Willows Creek with Doug.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Then I drove home.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I got home, I guess, and had dinner by
myself because – Because Doug had an alumni meeting at his school and he
was going to get a ride back. He’s the principal now, as you well
know.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: But wait – there was an accident before
that, wasn’t there? A girl – she had been beaten. I took her to the
hospital, right?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: There was indeed an accident, you were
detoured by the cops. But there’s no report of any girl.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, the cops weren’t there. They were back
on Main Road. A knocked-down telephone post, correct?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I saw the girl after that. She was
bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - antique wind chimes</strong>: sway in the night
breeze with their gentle tinkling SOUND, more menacing than joyful –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s house - night</strong>: A breathless
Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>extreme closeup - miranda’s eye</strong>: Jittery, alert. We
scour her every blood vessel, iris, pupil. FILLING the SCREEN and now we
distinctly make out an eerie shape reflected inside of it. But just for
a sec – The teenage girl.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What about your husband, what can you tell me
about him?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s the last memory you have of him that
night?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: My last – ? Tell me nothing happened to
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Let’s backtrack a second. You left your
office, you were driving home, you got detoured by the police – Did you
call someone on the phone that night?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t know. I might have.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who would you call?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I might have called Doug to tell him
something. Or checked my answering service.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Were you seeing someone else that night?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: There was some trouble in your marriage,
wasn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. loft - night</strong>: CAMERA PANS ACROSS
the large space to find Miranda and a MAN kissing heatedly.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Wasn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - continuous action</strong>: Miranda
chases the disconcerting image out of her head.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No. There was no trouble in my marriage, I
don’t know what – There is no trouble in my marriage. You just used the
past tense; why?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Did something happen to Doug?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You don’t remember anything else. Anything at
all?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: This is preposterous. What’s wrong with
Doug?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, he’s not. Don’t tell me that. Don’t
tell me that. Are you – sure?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m positive. You killed him.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - moments later</strong>: Irene and TWO NURSE
rush to Miranda’s cell. WE HEAR her hysterical CRIES from inside –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s going to be alright, Miranda. You just
need to sleep. It’s going to be alright –</p>
<p><strong>flashback sequence - series of shots</strong>: A blur of
images and scrambled snippets of memories come at us rapid-fire, like a
drug-induced dream:</p>
<p><strong>ext. ashley bridge - night</strong>: Miranda’s CAR SCREECHES
to a stop and she jumps out, glances around.</p>
<p><strong>int. st. anne’s high school - gymnasium - night</strong>:
Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes hands with proud
parents and clumsily formal students. Miranda grabs a drink from a
nearby tray, bored.</p>
<p><strong>doug</strong>: Is that number three?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes, Mr. Principal. Special occasion – I’m
celebrating how proud I am of my husband tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ext. movie theater - day</strong>: Miranda and a man exit the
theater. Giggling.</p>
<p><strong>int. loft - night</strong>: A flustered Miranda fumbles with
her purse and keys, heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared
lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m sorry. The fact is I’m married and I –
this is not me, this is a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Your marriage is the mistake and you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m sorry. That was out of line. I feel like a
school kid hiding from the Principal.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: We are hiding from the Principal.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I would just like to spend some time
together.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: We spend time together every day.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I meant minus the schizophrenic women.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I have to go. I need time to think.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Don’t be too hard on yourself, Dr. Grey. You
haven’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Not yet. But I want to.</p>
<p><strong>ext. miranda and doug’s house - morning</strong>: PUSH INTO a
quiet house on a quiet suburban street. Two Volvos parked in the
driveway. Perfectly-kept front lawn.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. miranda and doug’s house</strong>: Another
near-subliminal glimpse of Doug laying on the floor covered with
bloodstains. Bloodstained axe on floor in f.g. Walls covered with
bloodstains.</p>
<p><strong>ext. chapel - day</strong>: Miranda and Doug laugh at their
wedding. It’s clearly hot, because she wipes sweat off his brow with a
handkerchief.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s house - night</strong>: A breathless
Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks
down at her hand, noticing the blood – and now we are back in –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - night</strong>: Miranda wakes up with a
start. The darkness renders the room almost void of any color.
Monochromatic. It takes her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander
across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she’s being watched. We become
aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like somebody is standing over her
bed. But we don’t see anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and
peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She glances
back at the room, stills seeing nothing – and bangs on the door.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Can I get some assistance here? Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Irene?! Anybody!?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Wake up, wake up… You’re dreaming. It’s not
real. An anxiety dream, that’s all. That’s all. This is dream logic. If
it was real, they would have heard you scream. There are twenty
employees on the night shift. Fact. At least twenty.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m just dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m dreaming, I’m dreaming, I’m dreaming,
I’m dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m dreaming, I’m dreaming –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Rise and shine, ladies!</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - day</strong>: Irene tries to shake
Miranda awake. An orderly and nurse stand by.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That means you, honey. Up – !</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Rise and shine now. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Easy now, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I need to see Peter Graham.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: And you have a session scheduled this
afternoon –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: He’s not even in yet, now let go my arm,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Doctor Grey, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Actually I do mind. I start calling you
‘doctor’ and everybody else wants to be called ‘doctor’ –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Please. It’s a bit different, wouldn’t you
say – ?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What do you think you’re doing? I want to
speak to my lawyer – wait, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: My job.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: C’mon, Irene, don’t do this. I’m calm now,
look – I’m calm – !</p>
<p><strong>int. rec room - day</strong>: DRIFTING PAST the female
patients at their usual activities. Some watch TV, play dominoes, some
pretend to read, some stare out blankly. Here’s Chloe at a table,
engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead
named JENNA:</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen, Meallaril-S,
Meleretten, Meleril, Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine,
Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban Modalina –</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Modalina? Isn’t that a band?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Trade name for Triflupoerazine. Look it
up.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress, Motival.
That’s it for the ’M’s.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Not bad. High potency neuroleptics starting
with ‘J.’</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Trick question. There’s only Jatroneural.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: What do you wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Bet you a soda.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Right on the money, cowgirl. Twenty points
and a soda.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Hi there, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: I never got shrinked by you but all I hear
is nothing gets past you, I mean, that’s just hearsay and I don’t pay
much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband
with an axe but I say maybe it just slipped, right?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: They put your picture in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: How did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Chloe did. Who knows how? Not me. Around
here I’m on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff I don’t need
to know. My point is about people talking behind other people’s backs.
Like before I was here, everything I did I thought, ‘this’ll get them,’
wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back.
But now I’m more anonymous, more myself. I’m Shelley.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: You’re not like, undercover here, are you?
They pulled that at Spring Grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they
were patients, see if they could handle it. Most quit after day one.
You’re not, are you?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, Shelley. I’m not undercover.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Because if you were, I’m like the Fort Knox
of secrets. Ask anybody.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s good to know. But I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Say no more. I understand perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Drawing is a great cover. Good luck to
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. locker room - dressing area - day</strong>: Patients
undress in the bare-bones locker area. An uneasy Miranda is handed a bar
of soap and towel by Irene.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t – I think I’m alright.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You go in last because you’re special. It’s
not a Mexican prison, toots. Everybody here minds their own
business.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: If it’s all the same, I’d rather –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: State law says we keep you ladies clean. And
I’m a stickler for the law. Now come on. If you go downtown, you gotta
dance.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: That’s five minutes, group one. Alright,
ladies, nice and easy.</p>
<p><strong>int. communal showers - later</strong>: Miranda hangs her
head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. The
SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda and her RAGGED
BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group,
grab towels. Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but
Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her at the tile wall.
More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes
out. Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just
a hole with a busted pipe. PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed
globule of blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems to
come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. The blood lingers
tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing
an upward line along the tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and
now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. Miranda
looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the
showers. Panic. Shuts her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It isn’t real. It isn’t real.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It isn’t real. You’re hallucinating.</p>
<p><strong>int. locker room - dressing area</strong>: Miranda wraps a
towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything.
Fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to Shelley, tying her
shoelaces, muttering.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Shelley?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: And pick up those damn cigarette butts.
Jesus, TV is dumb –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Shelley, can you do me a favor??</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: The housewives will find something better
to do.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Can you go in the shower and tell me if you
see anything on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Enough privacy for you?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes. Thank you, Irene.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Nothing. It’s nothing –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What the hell did you do to yourself?!</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward corridor - later</strong>: THROUGH a glass pane
we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda’s arm. Parsons and Irene confer just
outside the room.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I looked away for a second. It’s
unacceptable, won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Not your fault. Patients always find a way
to hurt themselves if that’s what they want.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I just didn’t peg her for a cutter, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>int. rec room - later</strong>: Miranda ignores the looks
from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots Shelley by the window
furthest from the wardens. Scared.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You saw it?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Listen, Doctor. Some people, they have a
gift. And in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos,
they refuse to acknowledge that. It’s like that Hubble telescope that
sees things a trillion miles away but what it’s seeing is just reflected
light of a star that died a thousand years ago? It’s like that. Doesn’t
mean you’re crazy. It only means your eyes open in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What did it say?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: On the telescope?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Did you see anything, Shelley?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: That’s not tile that wall is made out of .
It’s a holographic screen. All part of your mission, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: This is all we have. The rest is dust.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - day</strong>: Pete and Miranda stare at
each other. A tense beat.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It was you I called that night.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Did you mention that to the cops?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I didn’t think it would help you.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It means they wouldn’t have let me treat you
if they thought I had any kind of involvement in what happened.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: And did you?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Did I what?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Did I make it to your place? Did I see you
that night?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: No. We got disconnected and I couldn’t get
through to you. I sat there waiting all night. Figured you’d changed
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me this before?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Because the only way you’ll be able to accept
these events is if you remember them on your own. My job is to assist
you in processing that information because you’re not in a frame of mind
to do it by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re changing the subject.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: The subject is you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Right now I don’t trust anyone.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You want to talk about today?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I want to talk to my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I think that’s premature.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I can’t help what you think.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute garden - day</strong>: SPRINKLER
SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP… The female patients are
out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda
alone at a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered to
her:</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: You a Marlboro girl?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t smoke, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: All we have is our health, cupcake. What I do
is quit constantly, start again. Drives them all crazy. One day I quit
three times.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: They allow me one match at a time and pretend
they’re not watching. Check it out: salivating goon number one at three
o’clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What did you set on fire to wind up
here?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt down the
building where I worked. I found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops
– of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. It’s beside the
point, really.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Phil.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Phil!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Hello, Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I wonder if I could talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Of course. Well, actually, I’m about
to…</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Your staff meeting’s done and Thursdays you
don’t schedule sessions until the afternoon. This will just take one
minute. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: True. But the Sheriff wants to ask me some
questions.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It’s about Pete.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Perhaps he’s not the most qualified person
to be treating me.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Are you complaining about his methods or
are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What did he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: He explained there might be a conflict of
interest because he has feelings for you. You two engaged in a kiss at
one point. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I told him we’re all grownups here and the
fact is he’s the best doctor on my staff. As such, and given the
severity of the charges you face, I consider him the most qualified
person to assist your recovery. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan
is not a patient man.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Hey! Chloe!</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You fucking cow giving me the evil eye, huh?
Fuck you, you fuckin’ voodoo witch – !</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Is okay, she’s okay – she don’t mean
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You bet your goddamn fat ass I mean it,
you’re a witch – !!</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: McGrath, that’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Take your voodoo shit back to Cuba –</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I said that’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Irene, she’s okay. Pobrecita, la infeliz.
It’s a misunderstanding. Pobrecita. I was only trying to help her –</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You wanna help me? You pity me? Suck me.</p>
<p>****: A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH –</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward corridor</strong>: SLOW PUSH DOWN empty
corridors. The air thick with dread –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - night</strong>: Miranda cries softly,
unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in from the corridor outside, wardens on
their rounds, a SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts
her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward library - day</strong>: Irene escorts Miranda
into the library. A warden follows.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: How are we feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: ‘We’?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Sorry I asked.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Doesn’t seem like the best choice of words
when treating schizophrenics.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Fitting right in, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: She’s due back in the rec room in twenty,
Counselor.</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: Thank you kindly.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Teddy, I know you knew Doug well and this
is an extremely –</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: I’m here as your lawyer. So whatever
my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence. First things
first, how are they treating you?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Like I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: You know this place better than
anyone. Anything out of the ordinary?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Other than me being crazy? No.</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: The DA is pushing for a hearing as
soon as next week. They’re eager to resolve this situation because –
well, crimes like this don’t happen that often around here. Doug was a
hometown boy who’d done good, beloved high school principal, a role
model. Our best shot – scratch that, our only shot – is to claim
temporary insanity.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Wait, wait, wait – Teddy, you know me. I
wouldn’t raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. Not even in
self-defense. Isn’t it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some
crazed high school student attacked Doug and I went into shock?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re telling me there’s no other suspects
in anyone’s mind?</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: Frankly, no. Neighbors heard screams.
They have you at the scene, they have the murder weapon and they have
your prints everywhere. The only thing they don’t have is motive.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Because there is no motive.</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: And that’s what’s confusing them. The
fact that you’re a brilliant psychiatrist doesn’t help either. It fills
their heads with ideas. They figure if you were to plan a murder you
might know how to fake insanity to get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m not faking anything.</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: Good. I pass no judgment either way.
The point is –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: The point is I’m the only person who
doesn’t believe I killed my husband. I never thought I’d say this, but I
feel like I’m in the middle of a conspiracy. Do you believe I’m
crazy?</p>
<p><strong>“not alone.”</strong>: Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks
down Teddy’s glass of water all over his papers, her chair topples over.
The warden and janitor look up – Teddy tries for delicate:</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I believe.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Forget it. Forget I asked.</p>
<p><strong>int. pete’s office - day</strong>: Miranda. Numb. Pete trying
hard to get through. A beat. We get a good look at the writing on her
arm.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I can’t help you if you don’t talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I can stand here all day. All week. You’re the
one running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I didn’t write this.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Then who?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You’re going to have to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Because no matter what’s going through your
mind right now, I haven’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Then you know exactly how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You admit you’re having a hard time
differentiating what’s reality from what’s hallucination, right? So
isn’t it at least possible that –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: As a doctor I agree with you. Maybe – and
this is a big maybe – all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends
to the limbic structures, but I’m telling you –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: How about this moment right now?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is this a hallucination?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You tell me. But I do know what I sound
like. Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Which is why I suggest we simply increase your
dose until –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No! Goddamnit! No!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m sorry. Is there any way we can pretend
that didn’t just happen?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I want to believe you. I do. So I’ll take
your word for it – you’re not involved in this – but you take mine: I
didn’t write this and I didn’t kill my husband.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Alright. Let’s say you didn’t write this –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Number one: I’m right-handed. Number two: I
would have had to bring an X-Acto knife into the shower to do this,
wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I think it’s time you look at these.</p>
<p><strong>“not alone.”</strong>: Miranda immediately tosses it away
from her. Repulsed –</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. miranda and doug’s house - night</strong>:
Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes her face
breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You wrote that. Any idea why?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, I didn’t. No, I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You’re the only person who can figure out what
this means. Try to remember. Stop holding back.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - int. miranda and doug’s house - night</strong>: A
breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on
it. She looks down at Doug, crawling on hands and knees. He moans
horribly, in shock. She grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows
him. He reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes
a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that’s
pretty much what he resembles. Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy
axe with both hands. Doug’s hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE
over her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA. Miranda wipes her
face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and
stares – WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda stares
at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For an instant we see the
teenage girl’s reflection there, beckoning. But now she’s gone and
Miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE
around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood on her clothes,
axe still in her hands. Looks back up at:</p>
<p><strong>the mirror version of miranda</strong>: shows a serene
expression on her face. Fire enveloping her. She slowly lifts her hands
over her head. In place of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES
on her wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified – like an extreme
version of Anima Sola. Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment – When
the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we’re back to reality. Miranda stares
at the axe she’s flung at it.</p>
<p><strong>blackness</strong>: Silence. And now, faintly at first, but
GROWING PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s bathroom - day</strong>: Miranda wakes up,
still in the tub. How long has she been there, hours? Days? Impossible
to know. But at some point she must have turned off the water. She sits
up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked with blood. The first
thing that hits her is the stench. And it’s foul, the putrid smell of
decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor
and follows the trail of blood, mortified at what she will find.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s living room - continuous
action</strong>: Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family
reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness the fruit of her
labor. She gasps for air. Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She
doubles over to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front
door. She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on the door
RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still stands there as the first
FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff Ryan and his deputies right behind. A
concerned Pete Graham behind them.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway - continuous action</strong>: She slips on
blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the bedroom –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s bedroom</strong>: She locks the door
behind her, hyperventilating in terror. Instantly there are men POUNDING
on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS. ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers
through the window in her backyard. About to smash the window. A caged
animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face with her hands.
Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently, about to give. And when she
brings her hands down she is staring straight into the teenage girl’s
face. And she OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - night</strong>: Miranda gasps for air,
drowning in sensory overload.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Oh God, oh God, oh God…</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - day</strong>: The locks are unlocked.
Pete appears at the door. Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a
different person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: How much does she remember?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It all came flooding back last night.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Guilt?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: More like an uncontrollable reminiscence.
Intense, over- cathected. She’s not feeling guilty of her actions, not
exactly. Sounds to me like last night she actually re-lived them in
great detail.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Hypermnesis following amnesia. Could a
specific epileptic element be involved?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s exactly what she suggested. Even in her
present state, her instincts remain impeccable.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I’d like to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward corridor - later</strong>: Pete escorts a
fragile Miranda down the corridor. The two orderlies walking ominously
behind them.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Standard procedure.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I didn’t say a word.</p>
<p><strong>int. dr. phil parsons’ office - day</strong>: Parsons on the
phone, gestures for them to enter.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Dorothy, I can’t discuss this now – I’m not
taking it lightly, no. We will talk about it at home.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Yes, dear. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I’m so sorry about this, Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Has Pete told you about the hearing?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Teddy already filled her in.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Teddy Howard is top notch. He’s going to do
everything in his power – and he’s quite resourceful – to prove you’re
not fit to stand trial. Miranda, I know you have no family left, so
we’re your family now and we’re all going down to the wire to protect
you and help you in any way we –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: The girl in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: My daughter.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: She’s the girl I saw.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: You’re obviously mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m positive. She was hurt, bleeding. Is
she all right?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miranda, you’ve seen that photograph at least
a dozen times, every time you’ve been in this office. You’re just
confused –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Not about this. Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: No, she’s not… all right. Rachel committed
suicide six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miranda, that’s none of your –</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: That’s okay. Rachel was a very troubled
girl. Handicapped since birth. She was born mute. My wife and I tried
everything to help her fit in but… but she ran away from home more than
once, wanting to end her life. And she finally succeeded. Jumped off
Ashley Bridge. She was only seventeen years old.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m – I’m terribly sorry, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Peter, can I speak to you?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: … Textbook psychotic pattern… manifestation of
guilt…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: … much she knows about Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m telling you she doesn’t… Concocted
alternate reality…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I’m trusting you… crawling with cops.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: This is not going to work. I’m sick of
being watched, and I know this place well and it doesn’t smell this
bad.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m awake, I’m not dreaming. I’m alive –
this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called paranormal activity
can be debunked a million different ways. So whatever you are, whatever
it is I’m making up here – I’m letting you go, I’m setting you free. I’m
the wrong person. And I need to sleep. I’m not afraid and I don’t
believe and I’m fully aware that this is all in my mind – fiction – a
concocted alternate reality – and I acknowledge it. And now I’m done
with it. I’m going to sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Besides, if you really were the ghost of
Rachel Parsons, you would let me out of this cell.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>int. female ward - corridor - night</strong>: Miranda takes a
tentative step outside her cell, feeling the door with her fingers,
feeling along the wall – still making sure she isn’t dreaming this. She
looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of neon lights making her
readjust her eyes momentarily. Nobody there. But when she looks down the
other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So
quick we’re not sure we saw it for sure. Miranda deliberately walks in
the opposite direction. At night the clinical corridor takes on an
unsettling quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her head
at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells. She turns to make
sure Rachel isn’t behind her and when Miranda faces forward again, she
realizes she is standing right across from:</p>
<p><strong>the nurses’ station</strong>: Where two nurses are watching
TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes past them, ducking at the window to remain
unseen.</p>
<p><strong>another corridor</strong>: This one is wider. Miranda is
startled by the sudden sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing
at their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she almost knocks over
a mop and bucket resting by the wall. She holds the mop in place and now
opens the door to a</p>
<p><strong>the stairs</strong>: Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging
the wall to stay clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area.
She waits at the landing, times it just right – and scurries to the next
floor.</p>
<p><strong>action</strong>: Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a
steady pace as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner and
stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his rounds. She waits until
he’s out of sight and rushes to her office. She pulls out the stolen
screwdriver and brings it to the lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She
does this as fast as she can, but she’s no professional – so it takes a
few tries. She loosens one screw, then another – and clumsily drops the
screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against the floor. Miranda sucks her
breath in, waits. No footsteps. She bends down, retrieves it, and holds
onto the knob for balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all
along. She simply forgot to check.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s office</strong>: Miranda shuts the door behind
her and slips behind her computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch
and a SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view of the
corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a smoke, a janitor at the
coffee machine and so on. She switches on her computer and taps her
fingers as she waits for it to boot up.</p>
<p><strong>on surveillance monitor</strong>: The JANITOR with his coffee
cup now heading back towards Miranda’s office corridor –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Alright. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>on computer screen</strong>: Various listings: The archive
news of her funeral, something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE
about teen suicide. That’s the one she chooses. Hits “PRINT.” She checks
the surveillance monitor again: the janitor now mops right outside her
door.</p>
<p><strong>on printout</strong>: The heading says “WHAT DRIVES OUR
TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?” A quick glimpse gives us ages and names of three
local girls who have died. Rachel’s name and PHOTOGRAPH appears with two
others: Jenny Dixon and Andrea White. Miranda pockets it, looks back at
the surveillance monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him
disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the screen is empty.
But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there. Staring
straight at her. Makes us jump.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor/stairs - moments later</strong>: Retracing her
steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the stairs. Playing off the sweep
of the surveillance camera.</p>
<p><strong>int. female ward corridor - continuous action</strong>: As
she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her way. She detours
down another corridor and hides from view. Waits for Consuelo and a
nurse to exit down the staircase.</p>
<p><strong>int. room 237</strong>: It takes a moment to adjust our eyes
to the darkness but now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in
some sort of struggle. Miranda presses her face against the glass and
now sees a flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle.
And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim light we
can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling. Just for a beat, because now
she is slapped down on the bed like a rag doll and the man with the
needle ENTERS</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - continuous action</strong>: Miranda flinches,
confused. Glances down the corridor to ensure she remains undiscovered.
Then peers back in.</p>
<p><strong>int. room 237</strong>: Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her
pale naked skin marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck
in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open but it is
impossible to tell whether she is laughing or sobbing. Abruptly the man
climbs on her, pulling off his T-shirt. As he discards it we see that it
is yellow.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - continuous action</strong>: Disturbed,
Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor isn’t empty. There is a
JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup in hand. Staring at her,
disconcerted.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>int. female ward stairs</strong>: Miranda bolts down the
stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and YELLS can be heard right behind
her.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It’s him! It’s him! Jesus Christ, it’s
him!</p>
<p><strong>int. conference room - day</strong>: TRACKING ALONG a long
desk where the staff finish their morning meeting. Parsons, Pete and
Irene among others.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We’ve transferred her to a higher security
room on the fifth floor. That’s my final concession to any type of
special treatment.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: And the night staff?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: They insist her room was properly locked,
what else could they say?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Could there be any truth to her claim?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Peter, we have one hundred and forty
employees. Thirty-five work maintenance. They all wear yellow shirts,
it’s their uniform. I’m holding a very discreet inquiry, sure – but I
don’t want a news van parked outside day and night. It makes much more
sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I perused Miranda’s files on Chloe McGrath –
they’re damn comprehensive. Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: The scariest gift God gave us is our minds.
And a bright person like Miranda – she’s grasping at straws here – who
knows what her brain is telling her, now that it’s snapped.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s new cell - day</strong>: A better room, in
fact. This one has a view. Heavy bars on the windows, but still. Miranda
paces. Pete is seated, observing her deteriorating state.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Did you live here when Rachel killed
herself?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yes. As a matter of fact, I was part of the
search party that found the body.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Phil must have been a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You can imagine. Actually, Phil was in Houston
undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: And this is confirmed. There are hospital
records and so forth?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m sure there are. Can we get back on track
now?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What about these other dates, was Phil here
when the other girls went missing and found dead?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Where are you going with this? First I’m a
suspect in Doug’s death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Rachel Parsons disappeared six years ago. A
week later she’s a suicide. Andrew White, four years ago, same M.O., and
Jenny Dixon, two years ago. Don’t you find that unusual?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What same M.O.? One jumped off a bridge, one
hung herself and one crashed her car. Who gave you this?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Not one left a suicide note. In fact, how
is anybody sure these were suicides?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You heard Phil, his daughter had tried several
times before –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s his story. I need to talk to the
reporter who wrote that. Frank something.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Well, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I beg to differ. I know my visitation
rights.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You can’t because… he died.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re telling me the one local
investigative reporter who connected three highly-suspicious deaths,
just happens to have conveniently died?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Frank Albright was an eighty-year- old retired
sociology professor. This is a fluff piece about teenage depression and
the breakdown of the nuclear family. You can find one in any local
paper, anywhere, any other week!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Don’t be smug, Pete. That’s one thing
you’ve never been. Rachel is somehow connected to what I’m going
through. I don’t know how – like you said, I’m not in a frame of mind to
process the information without assistance. So I’m asking you for
assistance.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Listen to me. You are not well. I had hoped
once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it
but these fixations:</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath – are
self-created distractions to avoid looking into yourself. And the longer
you –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I know this lecture like the back of my
hand!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Good. Saves me the trouble.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward corridor - moments later</strong>: Peter
hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. The same one who bandaged
Miranda earlier, so let’s give her a proper name: CLAIRE. She pushes her
cart into the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>int. third floor corridor - day</strong>: Claire and her cart
emerge from the elevator and she heads down the long corridor, reaches a
door and unlocks it.</p>
<p><strong>int. medical supply room</strong>: TIGHT ON a row of
drug-filled shelves. Claire parks her cart and kicks off her shoes. Digs
a pack of smokes out of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her.
Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner type named SIMON.
Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands all over her. She means to resist
but he’s got such boyish charm.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Get off me, you dog –</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hell, don’t go all bubbly with joy or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You can’t be in here and you know it. Nap in
your car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Now get out before we get busted.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You slay me, Claire. Honest.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sure I do, Boy Scout.</p>
<p><strong>int. elevator - moments later</strong>: Simon presses the
button, waits. He checks inside his folded uniform where we see several
stolen vials of sedatives. The doors begin to close when –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hold it, Simon!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What do you think I am, laundry service?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Won’t happen again, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward cafeteria - day</strong>: Bustling with
activity. The room is divided into two: a large main area where the
patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff. BOOM
DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table. Shelley beside her, playing
with her plastic fork. Jenna taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene
keeps watch nearby.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: … She’d get high on glue and make me help
her try on my bras. Is that the strangest shit you’ve heard?</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Heard stranger. But she’s a case.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: And she always put on a happy face. Man,
what an optometrist.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: You narced her out, didn’t you? Boo-hoo. Bet
you were a little buzzed yourself.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: All work, that woman. Work, work, work.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: She’s like an alcoholic. But with work.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: What work?</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: Not safe to tell you. Wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>upstairs</strong>: Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits
beside Chloe and starts talking. From Parson’s POV up above we can see
pretty much the entire dining area.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I saw what happened. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Have you told anyone? Chloe?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Look, Chloe – the person who did this to
you is not the devil. And if you can identify him, I’ll make sure the
motherfucker is arrested.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Doctor, did you just say ‘motherfucker’?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Do you know his name? Maybe you saw a
nametag on his uniform? Think.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Man, you must really hate me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What? I don’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You hate me because now you’re just the same
as me. You must feel so embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t hate you. And I don’t feel
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: That’s just a pat answer you have because
you’re new at this. Trust me, I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Forget it, alright? Forget we had this
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You know what happens next?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I get the distinct feeling you’re going to
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: The shock wears off and the guilt kicks in.
And that guilt is the real motherfucker. You’ll be watched 24/seven,
because they’re afraid you’ll kill yourself. Dr. Graham will question
every harmless gesture, every innocent comment, ever twitch you make and
eventually – and it’s a fucking tedious ‘eventually’ – you’ll stop
hating yourself for what you did. But what replaces that hatred is this
unbearable sadness. And you don’t lose that as long as you live.</p>
<p><strong>miranda’s resigned daily grind in quick dissolves –</strong>:
Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in the rec room. Irene
keeps watch in the garden as the women get their daily fresh air.
Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at night and the lights
go off.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - night</strong>: Echoing an earlier
scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her – her pale skin visible in the dim
monochromatic light. Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert.
Sensing something.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Leave me alone. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’ve lost my fucking mind. Happy now?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts
me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’ve always wanted to do a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: The more you fight me, the harder I get,
pussycat – so pretty please, with sugar on top – keep still.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Take that, son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>security camera pov</strong>: shows a uniformed janitor
calmly walking down the corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in –</p>
<p><strong>int. surveillance booth - night</strong>: A bank of monitors
keep watch on the premises after dark. TWO GUARDS play cards , bored to
tears. A cursory glance at the monitors produces no reaction. Certainly
a janitor walking down the corridor is no cause for alarm.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - night</strong>: Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP
or whatever it is crickets do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing
rows of unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon’s key-ring button repeatedly
until a set of headlights blink on and off.</p>
<p><strong>int. simon’s car - night</strong>: Miranda slips behind the
wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She
nearly drops dead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward gate - night</strong>: The gate GUARD reads a
magazine as Miranda’s stolen car approaches. The guard barely registers
the driver in the booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button
to open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Now we are seeing her as if from the
POV of someone traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the
passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly glances over.
Sees nothing but her own reflection. Turns back forward. We NOTICE the
blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling off the dashboard. Nothing but
a long stretch of road ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ext. miranda and doug’s house - night</strong>: The
neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda parks in the
driveway and stares at the empty house. Steels herself, climbs out of
the car and heads around back. She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted
plant, takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back
door.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s house</strong>: POLICE CRIME-SCENE
TAPE everywhere. She turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her
bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room,
avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether. Eerie as hell –</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - quick cuts</strong>: Miranda stuffs clothes
into a suitcase, finds her passport, digs out some cash from a box.
Quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapist’s uniform. Fast, fast,
fast –</p>
<p><strong>radio dj</strong>: … Weather forecasters predict heavy winds
tonight as a major thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow. You’re listening to
KLPG, 101.4 on your dial. This next honky-tonk heartbreak classic
is…</p>
<p><strong>ext. street</strong>: Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances
around. Looks inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath,
making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a U-turn.</p>
<p><strong>int. simon’s car - moving - continuous action</strong>:
Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling and turns UP
the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked. She’s driven maybe 20 feet when
suddenly her ENGINE DIES –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What is it you want me to do?!!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I can’t. Please, please don’t make me go
back in there.</p>
<p><strong>int. simon’s car</strong>: Miranda climbs in, not sure
whether to laugh or cry here. She’s never asked a ghost for permission
before:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Bear with me, I’m just parking it out of
the way so it won’t look suspicious in the middle of the road –
okay.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda and doug’s house</strong>: Miranda stands in her
living room, staring at her handiwork. Frozen with dread. The blood has
been cleaned up some, but the mess remains. The upturned furniture
covered in plastic, the chalk outline of the body, the yellow
crime-scene tape, the shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied
footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc. The faded writing on the
wall: “NOT ALONE.” Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she’s
supposed to be looking for.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Not alone. What happened to you happened to
other girls. I understand. And I’m sorry. But there is nothing I can do
about it now. It has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom</strong>: Miranda seated on the edge of the
tub, slowly pulls out the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket.
She grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut. And
now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER – she hears the hollow WET SOUND
we’ve come to associate with Rachel. Inside the room with her – Miranda
stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror move? We watch her from
the MIRROR POV as she holds perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now
seems to have STOPPED. A silent beat. She turns her attention back to
cleaning her cut, grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks
painful. And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes her
look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the
slaughter: flames all around her. Naked arms raised. Wrists shackled.
Anima Sola. She stares. Mesmerized. The sound of FLAMES GROWING</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No. No. No…</p>
<p><strong>ext. willows creek property - dawn</strong>: A “FOR SALE”
sign still flapping in the wind. The first few rays of light break
through the dawn sky. Miranda’s car approaches up the road until it
FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out. She studies the house
before walking up the drive. We watch her peek through windows and walk
around back, looking for something. What exactly, we don’t know. She
makes her way back to the starting point and fixes her stare now on the
barn. The one place he hasn’t looked.</p>
<p><strong>int. barn</strong>: Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the
ALUMINUM SIDING to FLAP NOISILY. It’s slightly unnerving, but hey, it’s
just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large room, perplexed.
There is something about this place. Something she can’t quite put her
finger on. Beckoning her. With a last fruitless look, she heads towards
the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her.
She moves to it.</p>
<p><strong>int. secret basement</strong>: Miranda emerges from the
ladder into total darkness. Whatever dim reddish light was provided by
the bulb upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall for a
switch. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It’s not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of
the dark, right?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Is there anybody here? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Go away! Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Wake up, Tracy, wake up –</p>
<p><strong>the patrol car</strong>: parked in front of the house. A
POLICE OFFICER cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up and
notices her. Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run. The officer waves. His
name is TURLINGTON.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Howdy there.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Y-yes.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: That your vehicle, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes – I – I just pulled over. I was –
looking for a bathroom. Morning sickness, you know…</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Congratulations. But I’m afraid
this is private property – you can’t just waltz on in. You understand
that.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’ll be on my merry way now. My husband
will never forgive me if I get a ticket for trespassing.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Holy shit. Lady, stay right
where you are.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Hands up where I can see
them.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Nice and slow, start talking to
me. And make it good. Tell me just exactly who that is.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jackson hospital - day</strong>: A car pulls up to the
chaotic ER area. Phil Parsons and Pete step out, rush inside.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital er - men’s room - day</strong>: Sheriff Ryan is
busy at the urinal. But even here he can’t find any peace because Teddy
Howard is on his case –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Mr. Howard – let me simply list the
events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a
janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution –</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: Hold on, there isn’t even any
substantial evidence –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Mr. Howard – there isn’t evidence
because the overdosed janitor hasn’t woken up, that’s why – and when
your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a
full syringe of –</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: You had no right to question my client
without my presence –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom.
Your client was read her rights and she still insisted –</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: – Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what
exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my
client’s cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself
before my client –</p>
<p><strong>int. er waiting room</strong>: Paramedics and nurses doing
their thing. The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a
cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: I’m not a drug expert. I’m simply
stating the frigging facts.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Phil, thank God – this guy’s driving
me nuts!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: An ‘incident’ – for lack of a better
frigging word – involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who’s been
tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she’ll even
utter another word.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Who’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: A runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie
Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some
barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I’m just now waiting
for the surgeon to give me an update. Notice, Counselor, how I’m not
even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Christ, the woman’s got the entire
hospital busy –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Why are you harassing my deputies?</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: I’m only asking him where he got the
coffee – ?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: He’s not at liberty to answer that.
You’ve had enough goddamn coffee already.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We need to get Miranda back to the institute.
She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Phil, how well does your wife know the
suspect?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Because she’s at the station right
now, demanding to speak with her.</p>
<p><strong>int. county station holding cell - day</strong>: Bare room. A
desk and two chairs. Glass window panes to insure no privacy. DOROTHY
PARSONS waits, seated. The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in.
She sits across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be. A long
beat.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I needed to see you, but I’m not sure where
to begin. I don’t know you well, I certainly have nothing but fond
feelings for you. Phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his
work and – in any case, I have always thought of you as a very bright,
very perceptive doctor. Even though I don’t know you well.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: My point is, my point being – when Rachel
died I had, um, I suffered through these spells, these recurring
dreams.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: And eventually, once I came to terms with
her death, they went away. Losing a child is the hardest, most
inconceivable event a mother can –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: The past few days I have been having the
same dream. A nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That word. Nightmare. Welcome to my
life.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: This nightmare involves Rachel but it also
involves you. In the nightmare Rachel holds a box in her left hand. A
small box. And she repeats a series of numbers. Now, Rachel never spoke,
from the time she was born – she had a condition – I often asked God why
he punished this child in such a way – she couldn’t speak, but she was
extremely bright. She wasn’t autistic as the doctors claimed –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Mrs. Parsons, you need a therapist.
Normally I would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you
can see –</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Every night the same box in her hand and
the same numbers. I wrote them down.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s a message. It’s a code for something.
I don’t know what. But she wants you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: October 22nd, 2001. It’s my wedding
date.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That code belongs to a safety deposit box
my husband kept in a bank up in Newcastle, that’s where his parents
live. Dorothy, I need you to drive up there and open it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - day</strong>: Pete hurries down the
front steps of the main building as TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda
is brought out of one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We can take those off now.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Don’t push it, Doctor. She’s cuffed
until your people secure her in a cell.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I was wrong. It wasn’t Phil Parsons. It was
Doug.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Can we talk about this later? Thanks,
Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Tomorrow morning first thing my
deputies are here.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I know, I know. We’ll see you then.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: And my offer still stands if you need
added security.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Thank you. She won’t go anywhere. I guarantee
it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s why Rachel picked me. It was Doug.
I’m so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Inside, okay?</p>
<p><strong>int. cafeteria - moments later</strong>: Lunch time for the
female wing. An excited Shelley rushes over to a table where Chloe and
Jenna are, whispers something to them. They glance at the door.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: She’s a hero. Little Red Riding Hood put the
big bad wolf in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>officer #1</strong>: They’re not gonna start something, are
they?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You ain’t scared of a bunch of women now, are
you, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s new cell</strong>: White. Surveillance cameras
in every corner. Two separate doors with elaborate locks. High security
all around. The officers undo Miranda’s cuffs and excuse themselves.
Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as well.</p>
<p><strong>orderly #1</strong>: We’ll be right outside, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I pulled a lot of strings to get you
transferred back. The best case scenario you’re looking at right now is
five years here. Five. Under my –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Peter, I didn’t believe in ghosts before
this. And neither do you.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: But you know that the brain is fully capable
of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. The simplest chemical
deficiencies can –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Chemical deficiencies can’t get inside of
you and make you do terrible things you don’t remember doing!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m a very open-minded person, but as a doctor
–</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, you’re not. You’re a close- minded
academic, just like me. You told me once that I was the most logical
person you knew, remember? Well, everything that’s happened has an
explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. Rachel
Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago – tossed off the
Ashley Bridge by my husband. My harmless, righteous ‘community leader’
husband – that’s how pathetically blind I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were also
abducted and murdered – now this was before I met Doug but I bet you
anything that they both went to his school. Then he obviously stopped
for a while: fear, guilt, distractions – namely me – delayed him from
reverting to his sickness. That’s why I didn’t notice anything. I
believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. Then along comes
Tracy Seaver and he can’t resist. Locks her up and tortures her in some
abandoned property –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Here’s Doug’s interest in real estate,
Pete.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with
an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her – she’s been
trying to communicate with them for years but they’re too goddamn
logical to pay attention – and she picked me, she sought me out that
night and sent me home to fix her problem. Made sure I killed Doug
because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to
her. And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is that a threat?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: To whom?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: To me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: To you? I’m telling you she nearly
electrocuted me when I tried to leave town and she led me to that barn
and if I don’t do what she wants – she’s going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I need you to at least consider the
possibility that I’m not insane. Not as a doctor. As the only person I
trust in this world.</p>
<p><strong>ext. newcastle community bank parking lot - day</strong>: A
tense Phil and Dorothy Parsons in their parked car.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m not doing it for Miranda, I’m doing
this for Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: You’re making a complete fool of yourself.
Do you realize what you sound like?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: What do I sound like, Phil? Like one of
your patients? Well, it’s probably because that’s exactly how you treat
me. And I’ve had enough of this deafening silence between us, this
exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives
with you pretending Rachel never existed.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m losing my mind. Our daughter is gone
and I miss her and I’m angry.</p>
<p><strong>int. bank vault - day</strong>: A solemn GUARD places the
safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room. Steps back
through the gate and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a
moment. Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife and
opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him
until his hands feel a thick envelope. He opens it and spills the
contents on the table. It is a stack of POLAROIDS. Dorothy leans in and
immediately her face darkens. She grabs onto the table, shakily – and is
forced to sit down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes
out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales, all blood
draining from his face.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - evening</strong>: The sky darkens
fast. The storm moving in.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward institute - nurses’ station</strong>: THUNDER
RUMBLES outside, making a tray of meds rattle. PAN UP to see Consuelo,
the round black woman we might remember Chloe beating up earlier. She
shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: It’s gonna be an interesting night.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s new cell</strong>: Miranda looks up at the
sound of the BOLT BEING DRAWN and the handle unfastened. Through the
door comes Consuelo, carrying a tray. Sets it down by the bed. She is on
her way out when she pauses, stares at Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: How are we doing today?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Just fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: The spirit is not fine. She’s very
unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: How – how do you know?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: But she’s only a girl. Do you know her
name?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes. Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Have you talked to her?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes, I – you could say that.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: She’s very, very angry. And she’s not
finished with you yet.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’m sure that’s meant to sound comforting
but –</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: She wants to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That may be so, but I want her to go
away.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Then you need to protect yourself.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: And how exactly would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Mira, first I’m gonna bring you some
cascarilla, it’s a powder, you get it anyplace, it comes from eggs – you
pour it all over you – Like this –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Look – Consuelo, I appreciate what you’re
trying to do, but I honestly don’t think this ghost will go away if I
pour some egg powder on myself –</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: She made you do things. Bad things, didn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: And you carried this out for her. She used
you as a vessel…</p>
<p><strong>flashback - ext. ashley bridge - night</strong>: We’re back
at the bridge. Rachel pries open Miranda’s mouth. Miranda panics:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What are you doing? I’m trying to help you
– ?!</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: You were possessed by her.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Ay, probrecita. You’re both in terrible
danger. She’s scared too but she can’t step back into the light until
she finishes what she started here. And now you’re the only person who
can help her find the way back.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t know how to do that – I’m not
qualified for it. You do it.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Despair is the only unforgivable sin.
You’ll be in my prayers, Miranda.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parsons’ house - night</strong>: Two POLICE CRUISERS
parked outside.</p>
<p><strong>int. parsons’ living room - night</strong>: A glassy-eyed
Phil Parsons serves himself another Scotch, devastated. The SHOT is
FRAMED so that we see the bedroom door is open, Dorothy lying in bed,
heavily tranquilized. Sheriff Ryan inspects the photographs.</p>
<p><strong>on the lurid polaroids</strong>: Postcards from hell: scared
teenage girls in forced poses – gagged, tortured – Andrea White, Jenny
Dixon, Tracy Seaver…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: This proves that her story is true: my
daughter appeared to her in some form and guided her through all this,
putting things right.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Come on, Phil, you of all people –</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I of all people hold logic, reason and
facts above everything else. And seek the truth through proof and proof
only. And what do you call that?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Has it occurred to you that maybe she
knew what her husband was doing to those girls?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: No. Frankly, it hasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Maybe she couldn’t stand the guilt and
cooked up this far-fetched tale to tug at everybody’s heartstrings. The
fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: The fact remains my daughter was murdered
and Miranda stopped the killer. A killer who was loose under your
incompetent nose for over six years. We don’t know how many future
victims were spared, but we do know she saved that girl in the barn’s
life. And that’s more than you or I can say – !</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Calm down. For the record, that girl
is on a ventilator. The doctors don’t think she’ll make it through
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Now, you want to stand up in a
courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this, that’s your
prerogative – but I have to abide by the law. And the law says Miranda
Grey faces criminal chargers. So here’s what we’re going to do. I’m
going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you don’t go anywhere
tonight and two of my deputies will go guard Ms. Grey until tomorrow
morning. Phil?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: There will be no breakouts, no aiding
and abetting, no taking the law into your own hands. It’ll take an Act
of God for Miranda Grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow. Are
we clear?</p>
<p><strong>squawking.</strong>: Parsons remains still for a moment, then
digs a photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in happier
times.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I’m sorry. I will never forgive myself for
what happened to you. Not as long as I live. I miss you so much.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - night</strong>: The WIND has really
PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING BOLT streaks the sky, officially
announcing the storm’s onset. A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard
gate.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: We’re here on Miranda Grey
detail.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Sixth floor. You can get a couple chairs
from the nurses up there. A pretty decent cup of joe too.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Thanks, guys.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Although why the Sheriff is making you
fellas waste your time is beside me. We got her right here. She ain’t
going no place.</p>
<p><strong>on monitor</strong>: Miranda inside her pristine white cell.
Restlessly pacing.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Looks perfectly harmless,
doesn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Don’t they all, Officer, don’t they
all?</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Shit. There goes the card game.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward institute - stairs - same time</strong>: The
two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No. No. What do you want – ?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I’ve done everything you’ve asked me to. My
life is ruined. I can’t take this anymore. I can’t… You have to step
into the light, Rachel. You don’t belong here – you don’t belong…</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Into the light – Can somebody come in here?
I need help. Somebody, please!</p>
<p><strong>same time</strong>: The cops reach the landing where we see
other flashlights down the corridor. They walk towards them.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Officer Turlington, ma’am. We’re
supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey’s cell all night.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Knock yourself out. Next floor up. It’s only
a power outage, ladies – let’s call it an early night.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s new cell - same time</strong>: Rachel
stretches out her arm to Miranda’s face –</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Please don’t. Why are you doing this? It’s
over. Over and done!</p>
<p><strong>miranda’s vision - andrea white</strong>: in her school
uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the image is bathed in a red and
blue light and we see her half-naked, bruised. Dead.</p>
<p><strong>jenny dixon</strong>: staring AT us in her school uniform.
Now abruptly she is a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also
bathed in the strange red and blue light –</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s new cell - continuous action</strong>: Miranda
screams at the visions. Rachel holds her steady.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Stop it! I don’t want to see this! I can’t
help you anymore! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Let me out of here! Let me out!</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward institute - corridor</strong>: The cops arrive
to find every door in the corridor flung open. Confused patients spill
out as guards and nurses try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK,
flashlights beam and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - various shots - night</strong>:
FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS blazing.
Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the
breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run
for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush after
her.</p>
<p><strong>int. woodward institute</strong>: Sheriff Ryan makes his way
through the mayhem, past Irene helping a patient, past nurse Claire
cowering in a corner –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Christ Almighty.</p>
<p><strong>int. sixth floor corridor</strong>: Officer Turlington runs
down the corridor, searching frantically with his flashlight –</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - night</strong>: A car pulls up at
the scene. Pete and Parsons step out.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miranda…</p>
<p><strong>int. sixth floor corridor</strong>: Officer Turlington looks
inside Miranda’s cell. Empty. And as he is about to speak into his
walkie he spots her: Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in
Shelley’s mouth as her seizing subsides.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right here.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sorry, we thought you might have
made a run for it.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Page Irene ASAP. This patient needs her
meds.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: You’re gonna get that Pulitzer after
all.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Shh, shh, just rest.</p>
<p><strong>shelley</strong>: I told you I could keep a secret.</p>
<p><strong>int. rec room - later</strong>: The patients are all
assembled here. Flashlights galore. Irene and Consuelo do head counts.
Guards, officers, janitors – everybody. Irene points a finger at
Jenna.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You have really disappointed me tonight,
Jenna –</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Give me a break. You wouldn’t respect me if I
hadn’t tried –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Everybody accounted for?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We’re doing the final count. Now they can’t
find the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Are you alright, Miranda?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Fine, Phil. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s going on, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: One of your patients is holding
the Sheriff at gunpoint. She’s in the cafeteria.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: I think Doctor Grey should be the one to
talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>int. cafeteria - moments later</strong>: The DOOR CRASHES
open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff inside. She has a gun pressed hard
against his ear.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Young lady, I don’t know how you think
you can get out of here, but –</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You’re very polite for a piggy. Now take off
your uniform.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Do it quick. I won’t make fun of you.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Nobody better fucking move up there or I’ll
blow this piggy’s head off!</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: That means you, fucko. Up on your feet or
I’ll start by shooting his ear off.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Tell junior the grownups are talking now and
he’s not allowed in here. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Turlington, it’s alright. I can – I’m
just going to –</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: The grownups are talking. Don’t paraphrase
me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: The grownups are – are talking now.
Just leave.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Chloe? Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Dreadful timing, I’m real busy.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You have to let him go. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Look – let’s not confuse things. I like you.
But this is my only chance. Now take off that goddamn uniform before I
get really pissed.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What are you going to do? Put on his
uniform and walk out of here? Think about it, Chloe. They know you have
him. The place is crawling with cops.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: What are my options? To grow old in this
place? It’s clear they will never let me go. Never. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s not true. You have less than a year
left here.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: That’s a lie! I’ll never stop being sick,
they’ll just find something new that’s wrong with me. No wonder you
doctors can’t help anyone – all you have are deficit columns and stupid
tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we’re
missing!</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re right, doctors never concentrate on
the things patients are actually capable of. But I know you, Chloe,
you’ve been through things that most people don’t survive. And you have
a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No more guilt, no more hatred, no more
unbearable sadness. You have no use for any of that anymore. Your life
begins this very second.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I’m so tired. So goddamn tired –</p>
<p><strong>life.</strong>: Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff
Ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the
cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea White and Jenny
Dixon visions. Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning
of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the Sheriff, finally
struck with the realization:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: It was you, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: ‘Not alone.’ That’s what Rachel has been
trying to tell me all along. Doug was not alone. You were with him. This
whole time it’s been you. You covered up their deaths to look like
suicides.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: You’ve lost your mind.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Don’t fucking move.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Miranda, don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: And just exactly who would believe
you? No proof, no living witness. Everybody knows you’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: I want that woman in custody. She has
a judge to face in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - night</strong>: Turlington escorts
a cuffed Miranda to a waiting cruiser. He jumps behind the wheel and
starts to pull out when Pete suddenly taps on Miranda’s window,
startling her –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’ll call your lawyer and – !</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sir, not now –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’ll meet you at the station!</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sir, please –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: The girl in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>int. jackson hospital - recovering room - night</strong>:
Tracy Seaver lies unconscious, hooked up to a series of machines. PULL
BACK to find Pete with a young DOCTOR.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Her condition remains the same. Basically
that ventilator is keeping her alive. We have no reason to think she’ll
ever wake up. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You mind if I stay here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Hey, it’s a big place. The more the merrier.
If I can just ask you to wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>int. waiting area</strong>: The Doctor gestures for Pete to
make himself comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>hospital loudspeaker</strong>: Dr. Brooks to ER. Dr. Brooks
–</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That’s me. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>int. recovery room #2</strong>: Like Tracy Seaver, Simon
Reynolds is hooked up to a bunch of machines and cables. Suddenly his
EYES SHOOT OPEN and the CARDIAC ALARM SQUEALS – Two NURSES rush in. The
young Doctor right behind.</p>
<p><strong>nurse #1</strong>: V-tach.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p><strong>ext. county police station - night</strong>: WE SEE
Turlington and two other COPS climb in a patrol car and drive off. WE
MOVE INSIDE the empty station…</p>
<p><strong>int. sheriff ryan’s office</strong>: Sheriff Ryan takes a
healthy chug from a fifth of Scotch, slips it back in a drawer. Stares
at his hands. Steady as a rock. Takes a deep breath. Knows what he must
do next. A religious man despite everything, he brings his thumb to his
forehead and crosses himself.</p>
<p><strong>int. county station - holding cell - moments later</strong>:
Miranda’s eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS SLIDING UNLOCKED.
Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: This isn’t one of your word
association games, Doctor. Did Douglas tell you that night?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Why wait this long if he had?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Maybe it’s your amnesia. Maybe you
blocked it out.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Maybe. But it seems to me that it’s vital
you know for sure.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: You think me and Doug are monsters.
That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. But it
wasn’t that at all. You do things sometimes and you’re not sure why you
did them. Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone
else. Life goes on.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: If you’re looking for forgiveness, you came
to the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: One thing about fear is it makes
people say the dumbest things.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Be that as it may, you’re afraid too –
because you know killing me won’t solve your problems.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: My only problem is you.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: What about Parsons? And Peter? They know.
And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. You
miscalculated, now you pay.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: I hate a bad bluffer.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I sure hope that felt good because you
can’t afford too many more signs of struggle. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Go ahead, hit me back. It’s what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: No, that’s what you want me to do.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Back to profiling, huh? Your thought
process is completely transparent.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: So we’re even. You left that door open so
I’d try and run, it’s what you get off on, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: I guess we’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: And yet you have to make me look like a
suicide. With what, your belt? How would I get access to a belt?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Trust me, prisoners hang themselves
with just about anything.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: I don’t think that’s going to satisfy you.
You won’t be able to do this clean. You have too much guilt inside.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: You’re losing grasp of the situation. It
was different with those girls. I bet all they did was cry and
scream.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Don’t worry, you’ll scream. Take off
your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Aren’t I a little old for you?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: That’s for show. You know you can’t shoot
me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: But I can smash your teeth out and
make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. Now shut up,
take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Today, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway to cell area - continuous action</strong>:
Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes quick inventory
of the space: two more holding cells like her own, a row of filing
cabinets, and a storage area with barred windows. She makes a turn up
ahead and reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate that
closes off the cell area from the main station. She tries the gate.
Locked, naturally. She shakes and bangs on it, desperate.</p>
<p><strong>turlington!! somebody help me!!</strong>: No response. And no
way to disguise the sheer panic in her voice. She fell for his trap.
They’re all alone here.</p>
<p><strong>int. miranda’s cell - same time</strong>: Ryan smiles at
that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks towards her, taking his time.
Relishing the hunt.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Doug mentioned you were painfully
‘modest.’ But enough about you, let’s discuss Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway to cell area - continuous action</strong>: Now
Miranda searches for a place to hide. His FOOTSTEPS</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: She was no crippled saint. Wasn’t the
first time she turned up at Doug’s house all messed up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Sure she was a minor, but she wasn’t
going to let that get in her way.</p>
<p><strong>int. storage area - same time</strong>: Miranda is cramped
underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT is FRAMED so we can see the
doorway. She prays silently:</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Rachel, where are you when I need you?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Those other girls – make no mistake –
they knew what they were getting into.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: I’m not saying they knew they were
going to die, but truth is, Doug and I didn’t know it was going to end
that way. It was just the natural extension of that moment. So yeah, we
fucked them and we killed them. And we knew it was wrong. Sure we
did.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway to cell area - continuous action</strong>: She
slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt
behind her when the door suddenly SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her
backwards onto the floor – He looms over her. She reaches around for
anything to defend herself. Nothing there. Game over –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: It wasn’t some satanic pact, society
didn’t make us do it. But I believe given the proper circumstances a
person is capable of anything – certainly in my line of work you see it
day in, day out. Tell you what, keep the shirt. The bra will do.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to get to
the bottom of this and you did. You followed it all the way through.
This is how it ends.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Doug settled down once you two got
married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway
I’d found, Tracy Seaver –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Or so he claimed. Because the truth,
Doc – is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn’t resist. I
asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work
her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: You can’t count on anyone, even
friends you’ve had your whole life.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: The only soul you can ever count on is
yourself –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: Why, Doctor. That was unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: You sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff ryan</strong>: You need me alive for your story to
stick. Be logical now. You know you can’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Logic is overrated.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital - waiting room - night</strong>: The door to
Tracy’s room is closed. WE FIND Pete where we left him, by the soda
machine, fighting to stay awake.</p>
<p><strong>int. recovery room #1</strong>: Pete looks oddly around the
room.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Anybody in here – ?</p>
<p><strong>tracy seaver</strong>: Hello – ?</p>
<p><strong>ext. county police station - night</strong>: Turlington comes
out of his cruiser, carrying a bag of take-out food. Chatting with his
colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway to sheriff ryan’s office - moments
later</strong>: Turlington raps on the Sheriff’s door and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sheriff Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>int. men’s room - moments later</strong>: Turlington peeks
in. checks the stalls.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>front desk officer</strong>: I’m sorry, but nobody is allowed
to visit at this hour –</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Is the Sheriff here or isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Help you, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We’re here to see Miranda Grey.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: You know full well you’re not
allowed to see –</p>
<p><strong>teddy howard</strong>: That’s straight from Judge Wilkinson.
Take us to her cell.</p>
<p><strong>front desk officer</strong>: Better get the Sheriff out
here.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Sheriff Ryan isn’t here. His car
is gone too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Officer, unlock the goddamn door to
Miranda’s cell or I’ll break it down myself.</p>
<p><strong>int. holding cell</strong>: Sheriff Ryan, splayed. Very
dead.</p>
<p><strong>officer turlington</strong>: Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>ext. woodward institute - day</strong>: CAMERA SOARS THROUGH
the tall gates, PAST the guard, PAST the sprinklers watering the
impressive gardens. A TAXICAB pulls up.</p>
<p><strong>superimpose: six months later</strong>: A healthier, much
happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete’s hand at the front steps. Small
suitcase by her side.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Thank you for everything, Dr. Graham. I’ll
never forget all you’ve done for me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s been my pleasure, Miss McGrath. Good luck
out there.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Well, I guess this is it. I hope not to see
you again unless it’s for coffee or something.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hey, you never know. It’s a small world,
unless you have to clean it.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want
to, but – have you ever heard anything from – ?</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on both
feet, preferably having been promoted to director after Phil’s
retirement. Not that you had much competition, but a big hug to you
anyway… I was as surprised as anyone to read about Sheriff Ryan’s
suicide and the startling discovery that it was he who murdered my late
husband. I wish I could personally thank certain people for their
convincing testimonies in the case.</p>
<p><strong>newspaper headlines</strong>: fly AT us under her V.O.:
“Female doctor still at large, wanted for questioning,” with a picture
of Miranda underneath. “Guilt-ridden serial killer killed accomplice,
then killed self: Female Doctor cleared on charges.” Pictures of Sheriff
Ryan and Douglas Grey side by side. “Authorities close case on dual
serial killers: community mourns murdered daughters.” A picture of
Officer Turlington, Pete, and Phil Parsons at a press conference.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: As for myself, I have a new name now and a
job working with teenage girls at a runaway shelter, trying to keep an
open mind at the horrors they tell me…</p>
<p><strong>ext. cemetery - day</strong>: BOOM DOWN TO a young woman
kneeling down to set flowers on a grave and we recognize her as Tracy
Seaver. Shockingly cleaned up and properly attired – she’s even
cute.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Which reminds me: Consuelo the Cuban witch
is a keeper, don’t fire her. She knows things about the world you and I
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: Well, gotta run now, I have some country
songs to write and lots of social invites to decline…</p>
<p><strong>ext. bleeker street - day</strong>: Miranda walking among the
throng of pedestrians. She looks confident, relaxed, down to earth. No
longer the tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story.</p>
<p><strong>miranda</strong>: P.S. And in case you’re wondering what the
chances are of me buying you a beer and maybe finishing something we
almost started, the answer is: it’s just not going to happen. Especially
not at McSorley’s next Friday night. Say around nine. So you probably
shouldn’t bother showing up. All my love, M.G.</p>
