<h1 id="l-avventura">l-avventura</h1>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So, there you are… I’ve been upstairs looking
all over for you…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, I thought you were already on the high
seas.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, not yet, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Isn’t it fashionable any more to put on a
sailor’s cap with the name of the yacht?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, Dad, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And how long will you be away?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Four or five days.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, very well. I’ll just spend the weekend
alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by
now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Used to what?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: To the fact of my retirement, not only as a
diplomat but also as a father.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But how could you say such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Because it’s true. After thirty years – not
having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself
to do so with my own daughter.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And have you any other truths to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You already know what they are.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You mean Sandro, don’t you? Well, I beg of
you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: That type will never marry you, my
child.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Up until now, Dad, I’ve been the one who
hasn’t wanted to marry him.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s the same thing. Goodbye, dear.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Have you been waiting long? You’ll have to
excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please hurry, Alvaro. We’re late.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’ll wait for you here.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: If I had a man waiting for me for half an
hour and whom I hadn’t seen for a month …</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know, I could just as well go without
seeing him today.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What! After giving us such a run
around…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I see… so it’s farewell to the yacht…and
farewell to the cruise…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know, it’s terrible to be far away from
one another. Really, it’s difficult to keep an affair going when one is
here and the other is somewhere else. But, at the same time…it’s
comforting. Because it gives you a chance to consider what you want and
how you want it… but when he’s right there before you all the time…
well, he’s right there… Oh, let’s go back….</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Would you like to see my profile?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Well, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But your friend is waiting downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I have a feeling that you’re not used to
being alone.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: That seems to apply to you also…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Don’t be so humble.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How should I be … arrogant?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But of course… arrogant, haughty… Hasn’t
Anna ever told you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It was lovelier before.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s all my fault!</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: And who do you think made that hole over
there?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: There’s nothing much to laugh at.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And that’s what I say, too. We could have
all been killed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sorry … but I can’t help laughing…</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: It’s as smooth and slick as oil.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I detest comparisons made with oil.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Did you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night
planning to do some thinking about a number of things … instead, I fell
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I didn’t know one could sleep so well on a
yacht. It lulls you …</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It would be better for you to get some
sun.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Shall we go for a swim?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, no… please… not here. It looks too
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: At one time the Aeolian isles were all
volcanoes.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: You must know your third grade geography
book inside out.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What is that one over there called?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: That must be Basiluzzo.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sounds like the name of a fish – merluzzo,
basiluzzo…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Now that one is Lisca Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, my goodness… All that yapping just for a
little swim.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Anna!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Stop … stop the boat!</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: How’s the water?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Let’s see you dive from the top of those
rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational. Come on, Giulia … your
life is much too circumscribed.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: What has everybody got against me this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Raimondo!</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Why have we stopped?</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Lady Patrizia!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Aren’t you going in for a swim,
Patrizia?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: What makes you think I would even dream of
such a thing? Raimondo, why don’t you go in for a dip?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Raimondo… Do you enjoy fishing
underwater?</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: I detest it. But, after all, what can you
do… It’s the latest…and I try my best to adapt myself.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Who ever said that man was originally a
creature of the sea!</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: I have never understood the islands. With
all that water around them, poor things …</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When do you have to go back?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I don’t know… It depends on Ettore… He’s now
in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Then how come you’re not with him?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: What a question… Because I want to be with
you, naturally. I hope he doesn’t close the deal so he’ll leave me alone
at least for a few days… Isn’t this water wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’d like to find a place where I can get some
peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I’d like to try…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: What could be more restful than this?…
Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Where is she going?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I’ve always worked on pleasure boats… even
though it’s more tiring.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Because the owners never seem to have any
fixed hours. For example, last night we kept right on sailing… We didn’t
even have a chance to get some sleep. Still, I like it better.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I’m going ashore to take a look around the
island. There are some ruins up there…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: There too…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Well, we’re still in Italy, you know!</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: What kind of a fish is that?</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: It’s a cernia.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: My God, it’s enormous.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A shark!… A shark!</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Don’t move, lady… Stay where you are… Stop!
Everybody keep still.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Stay away!</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Anna…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But how did you become aware of it? Did it
touch you?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: I would have died.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: … and how ugly they are … with all those
teeth…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: There’s a shark in the area. Don’t move from
where you are!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Who’s moving?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Here, drink some cognac.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s nothing… really. Let’s go back… It’s all
over now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Only, I’d like to change. I’m a little
cold.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But where did the shark go to?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Which one shall I wear?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: This one is gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Then why don’t you try it on?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It looks better on you than it does on me… You
keep it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know, that thing about the shark was all a
joke.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: There’s the difference between you and me:
you know how to put over certain things, and I don’t. Sometimes I envy
you.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But aren’t you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Ma’am, sharks never attack anybody. Anyway,
the raft is dark, and they wouldn’t be able to see it.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: So, it is true that they’re blind…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fine. Can’t you see so yourself?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I have an urge to put my feet on some land.
Aren’t you coming?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Anna… Maybe it would be better to wait a
while.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wait for what?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Well, with a shark running loose around
the place, I for one won’t get aboard that raft! They’ll have to catch
it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Better dead.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Will the three of us fit?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sure, sure. There’s plenty of room.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Claudia, aren’t you coming?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m certainly not going to swim across.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We’ll send the raft back to you.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: And bring some cushions when you come, and a
towel…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Okay. Come ahead, come ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I’m taking the boat right up to the shore,
and we’ll let you get off from the gangplank as soon as we get
there.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: What do you want, Raimondo? Do you want
me? A few years ago, maybe… but now… And, then, at this hour of the
day!</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Come, Claudia, do come in… There’s no
romance going on here.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: There, have you seen enough now? Are you
satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Now, tell the truth, aren’t you a bit
disappointed?… But I already told you…</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: If women’s breasts were colored, yours
would be blue…</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of
Raimondo?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I would say he’s pretty depraved.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Oh no; quite the contrary. He’s really
just a child.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Patrizia, don’t start in again… I would
rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You know, I don’t love anybody.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: I know, dammit, I know! And just think –
if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds
of dissipations, degradations, infidelities… of.. . of… of debaucheries,
it’s her. Well, anyway, she’s faithful. Faithful out of laziness… of
unwillingness.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: He amuses me. I don’t know of anything
more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don’t you find it so,
Claudia?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: One would have to be in love with somebody
to know that.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Have you ever been in love?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Not really… It’s suffocating in here… Shall
we go out?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: If any of you get into your bathing suits
again, you can be sure we won’t be seeing one another for the rest of
the year. I just can’t stand seeing anybody in the city after having
seen them naked on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, how sweet… What a dear little
darling!</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Who are you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: To the shark.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Say, Claudia, wouldn’t you like to climb up
with me and take a look over there?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: At what?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: At the ruins. They’re very ancient, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: That sounds like a good idea. But why don’t
we all go together?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Please, I beg of you, stay here.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well, what?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Have you decided?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: All I said was that it sounds like a good
idea.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Why didn’t you ask me to go with you?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Do you know why? Because if you saw those
ruins I’m sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You
always say “how beautiful” to everything – whether it’s the sea, or a
baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs
for anything.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: But Corrado… If something is beautiful why
shouldn’t one say so?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to
let me know that he doesn’t care about me any more.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our
twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and
publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Twelve years … But why haven’t they
married?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And why haven’t they left each other?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m beginning to have my doubts. It
couldn’t be that they’re in love?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Could be. They’re the kind of people who are
capable of anything.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: The trouble with you is that nobody can
speak to you, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Giulia, don’t you understand that the more
involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with
them?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: You men are all so dreadful!</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I know we are. But as the years go by, we
become even worse. Isn’t that so, Corrado?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: That’s Patrizia’s way of letting us know
she’s with us.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I think you’re very sweet, Corrado.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: More so than the shark?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: There’s no comparison.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Then why don’t we go up and see the
ruins?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sandro… A month is too long a time. I have
become used to being without you.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You’ll get over it soon. It’s the usual
anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A little more so this time.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: So, it will just take you a little longer to
get over it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But I think we should talk about it. Or are
you fully convinced that we too won’t understand each other?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: There will be plenty of time to talk about
it later. We’ll get married soon. That way we’ll have more time…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: In this case, getting married means nothing.
Aren’t we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia –
aren’t they already the same as being married?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But why rattle your brains by arguing and
talking… Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to
confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn’t I that enough?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. It’s not enough… I told you before that I
would like to get away for a while and be alone.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But you just said that a month was too…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I mean, to stay away longer – two months… a
year… three years… Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The
very idea of losing you makes me want to die… And yet… I… I just don’t
have the same feeling for you any more.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And what about yesterday… at my house…
didn’t you have any feeling for me, even then?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There you go… Must you always spoil
everything!</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Looks like the weather is changing.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize
the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We’ll have to get going.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And where’s Anna? Isn’t she on the
yacht?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: I don’t know… you see… we were taking a
little nap…</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: You’ve made some mistake there with the
bushes… that’s why you can’t finish it.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you
getting so impatient?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Patrizia! …</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is Anna there?</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: She’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: This is the kind of behavior that drives me
crazy!</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Did you find her?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s a lamb!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Find anything?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Perhaps she’s taking a swim somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: It’s really a fact – there’s nothing new
under the sun. Now, look here. Look at this structure… a kind of natural
shelter. Sandro, that’s how you should design your houses.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Me?… I no longer have any interest in
building… And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in
Milan?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Somebody must live here!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: But Anna wouldn’t be staying with the kind
of people who live here.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: We had better get started. The storm may
break any minute now.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What do you mean! What about Anna?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Tell Lady Patrizia that we can’t leave now.
In fact, we’ll have to make a tour around the island…</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Wouldn’t it be better if you told that to
the Lady yourself. I can’t assume the responsibility for keeping the
boat here. There’s no place to tie it up… And then, you know, it’s got a
flat bottom, and if the sea gets a little too rough…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: That doesn’t make any difference! If we have
to stay, we’ll stay!</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Perhaps she wasn’t feeling well… Maybe a
cramp or something…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a
cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But you have to consider all
possibilities, Sandro.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: There are some footprints around here…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Patrizia!</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Mario…Steer the boat that way.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Shall I turn back?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: No. Now that we’re here, let’s have a look
around Basiluzzo. When we were swimming, she swam out in that
direction.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: It won’t be easy to find a place to go
ashore.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Let’s try to be practical about this. The
best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has
a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I’ll
remain here… because… well, I don’t know, but it seems to me that
something may turn up. Anyway, I just don’t feel like leaving.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Then let’s get started… It’s senseless to
waste any more time.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: How long will it take to go there and come
back?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: If there’s a police station at Panarea, it
should take us a couple of hours. But if we have to go to Lipari, it
will take much longer. Then it also depends on how rough the sea is.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I’ll stay here also.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But why?… What if it starts to rain?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: If it rains, I’ll buy myself an
umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are
already two of us staying…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I’ll go even further and say that her
presence here – I don’t want to sound offensive – could be a great
hindrance.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Do you want some blankets? … and something
to eat?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: As far as I’m concerned, I think she’s
alive… Why, even this morning… that business about the shark… it wasn’t
at all true.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And why do you tell us this only now?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I… I don’t know… I didn’t think it was
worthwhile… She was laughing over it…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Really! Still, it remains to be seen why
she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Maybe you’d better ask him.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: What were you and Anna arguing about?…
Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Nothing but the usual argument… The only
thing was – if I remember correctly – that she said she had a need to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And how do you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Are you the owner of this place?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: No. The owners are in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But where did you come from?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: From Panarea. Why?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Ah, then it was you… I heard a boat leaving
here at two o’clock today…</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It must have been around four or five…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: In the afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: No… in the morning. Why? What’s
happened?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Nothing… nothing at all!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But why don’t you tell him? A girl who was
with us has disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What do you mean… disappeared? Was she
drowned?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, she didn’t drown… She just disappeared,
and nobody knows where.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And I suppose it’s my fault… Why don’t you
tell him that too. That’s what you believe, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Rather than being so occupied with my
thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna
was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Have you searched in back of the house to
see if she might have fallen off that cliff? Last month that’s what
happened to one of my sheep… I looked all over for it all day long and
it wasn’t until late at night that I heard it bleating… It had been
there the whole day… and was almost dead.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Anna! . . . Anna!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Come, Claudia…come back inside.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Are you feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m sorry about last night. Please forgive
me.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You’re very fond of Anna, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes, very much so.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Has she ever spoken to you about me?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Occasionally, but always with
affection.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And yet, she seemed to feel that our love
for her – mine, yours, even her father’s, in a certain sense – weren’t
enough for her, or didn’t mean much to her.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I know. I keep asking myself what I could
have done to prevent all this from happening.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Whose boat is that?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: What boat?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Just a moment ago… didn’t you hear the sound
of a motor?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: At this time of the year there are so many
boats…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And how come you’re up so early?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Early? Is four in the morning early for
you?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: How did you spend the night?… In that hut?…
And what did you have to eat?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First
at Panarea, where there weren’t any boats… then at Lipari, where
everybody was asleep… And the phone call to Rome…</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: We had to notify her father.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Yes, that was a very good idea.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: He’ll be here sometime today. I also
phoned my house in Milan… but Ettore had already left.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Anything new develop?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Unfortunately, no.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Very well. First of all, I’ll have them
search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me…
Meanwhile, we’ll take a look up around here.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses,
you’ll need some rope and ladders…</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Don’t worry, we’ve got everything.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Another thing; there’s an old man who lives
here on the island…</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I know, I know. One thing at a time.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: No, who wants crackers… Why don’t you go
and have some coffee made instead?</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: Nothing here!</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Don’t look at me like that, Marshal… I had
nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Let’s hope they don’t find her… If they
do, they would find her dead.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Listen, Patrizia… The Marshal says there’s a
current that passes by here and ends up at another island… I don’t know
which… He wants to send one of his men over to have a look… One never
knows… Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: I don’t see why I should mind.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I think that you might go and have a look
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes, maybe that is better.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so
calm.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Calm?… He doesn’t seem so to me… He was
awake all night.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frogman</strong>: An ancient vase. There’s a buried city
under here. It’s full of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it
belongs to.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Corrado, why don’t you ask them to give it
to us as a gift?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Really! So that you can stuff it with your
geraniums.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But aren’t you supposed to be on your
way?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes… I’m going… I’m going now.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: It’s already two hours… What are we going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: It takes about twenty to twenty-two
hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>elderly gentleman</strong>: And sometimes even twenty-four…
depending on the wind…</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: If the girl disappeared yesterday
afternoon, we’ll have to wait at least until three or four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: It belongs to me… We found it…</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Back… Stand back!</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: You see? It contains cigarettes. We’ll
have to confiscate it.</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: These people are contemptible. They
have no sense of dignity at all.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: It couldn’t have come from anywhere
else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity… But I really can’t
understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It’s the first time
that ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Look… I’d like to get back to Lisca
Bianca.</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: But how could we…at a time like this
when we just… well, let’s at least first have a look around the other
islands. Could be that something might turn up there.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But even here we were supposed to find who
knows what… And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: … Is it also true that you saw no boat
around here at Lisca between yesterday and this morning?</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: How many times do I have to tell you,
Marshal, that I was at Panarea.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I believe you, I believe you… But I’m also
certain that you’re hiding something from me. I can see it written all
over your face… And you know that I have never liked your face. And if
you want to know something, that gentleman over there… …who’s a very
important person… doesn’t like it either. So, just keep that in mind.
I’ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: I presume by this method that you’ll
be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of
clothing… In other words, something which your men have not been able to
find as yet.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Without any doubt, sir. If anything
belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island…</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: Allow me to inform you that my
daughter is not a fugitive.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t mean to put it
that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I…</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: I understand very well. Only I don’t
want any rash assumptions to be made.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Here’s her valise, sir.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Do you want me to open it?</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: This looks to me like a good sign.
Don’t you think so? As far as I’m concerned, anyone who reads the Bible
could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why… as a matter of
fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be
involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife
of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a
Bible… And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue
alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of… suicide. Why, it was
logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and
therefore… No? You don’t believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was
right… The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Sir, if you have no objections, may we
start the search?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Get everybody out of the way…</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Okay. I’ll send them down to that part of
the beach over there…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s because of this… The dress… It’s
because of this dress. Anna gave it to me yesterday, right after the
swim.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: And what are we going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: We’ll try again.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But is it really necessary? Those two
beasts… How absurd!</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Sandro’s here.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: I don’t know him.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: It seems to me that at a moment like
this…</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: I don’t want to know him.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Claudia, listen … Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I didn’t think you’d be back so early.</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: We didn’t check the other islands,
so…</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: And why didn’t you go there?</p>
<p><strong>carabiniere</strong>: He wanted to come back.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: Up until now those smugglers were operating
only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the
Lieutenant in Milazzo… Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and
have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: So… the boat we saw yesterday afternoon
might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible,
then, that Anna…?</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I wonder where they could have unloaded the
stuff … Maybe right here at Lisca.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: I was saying… it might even be possible
that Anna had left with them.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: But for what reason would she have wanted
to go away?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Listen, Marshal… As for there being reasons
for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you
can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that
the smugglers might have taken her aboard?</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: I think it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>a sailor</strong>: Marshal!… Headquarters is calling. They
have an important message.</p>
<p><strong>marshal</strong>: What is it about?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: They’ve stopped a suspicious-looking boat a
few miles from here… yesterday afternoon. The crew has been taken to
Milazzo for questioning.</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Did you hear that? What do you plan on
doing?</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: We are in the hands of God.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: That’s true…But in the meantime, as far as
I’m concerned, it’s absolutely necessary to go to Milazzo. I know that
you have no desire to meet me, and I shall take pains not to impose
myself upon you. But, besides you, I am the closest person to your
daughter…</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: However that may be, at this moment
my daughter has more need of her father than of you.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Pardon me for being so frank, but there are
certain things that a father – especially a father like you –cannot
understand. So don’t be stubborn. I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Patrizia, what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: What do you want us to do? I don’t know
myself… But we’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I’ll go and get my valise.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: We’ve decided to go to Montaldo’s place.
In fact, Ettore should already be there.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Good. Then I’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m going with the patrol boat to make a
tour around the islands.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I just can’t leave without first searching
those islands, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But aren’t you tired? I can just about
manage to stand on my feet! Raimondo!</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Here I am, Patrizia. I’m always here.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Claudia isn’t coming with us. Will you
please take care of her luggage? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: No, sir, Lieutenant, we weren’t even able to
drop anchor once … the sea was too rough.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Okay. Just sign here. Have the next one
come in. He’s the last, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: They tell me you have a lot of trouble
at home. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: Yes, sir. My sister is sick… and my
father, too.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: So that’s why you’ve turned to
smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that
you get some assistance from the government. But first there’s a little
formality we’ve got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we
can all go to lunch… Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three
times…</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: Yes, sir. Three times.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now, we’re getting somewhere! They’re
beginning to contradict each other. Now look here, your friend just
swore to me that you weren’t able to do any fishing at all because the
sea was too rough… And what about the other boat?</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: What other boat?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now look, my men saw it and they also
saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say
about that?</p>
<p><strong>young sailor</strong>: I … I … wasn’t feeling well … I.. I
was sleeping… I don’t know anything … I … I’m all mixed up and …</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But what are you saying?… What are you
saying?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Now look here, I’m ready to forget the
whole thing: the cigarettes, the contraband – everything. If you would
only tell me… you or your friends… whether the girl was aboard your boat
and how far she went.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Just as I thought. Even if you caught
them in the act, they’d deny it. They always deny everything. And then,
in this case, if they were to admit having had the girl aboard, it would
mean they’d be admitting to the charge of carrying contraband. Oh, it’s
easy to say: talk! But if they did talk, the following morning you’d
find them cold dead in front of their doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s father</strong>: I think it would be worth my while to
take a run over to Palermo. The Chief of Police there is a very good
friend of mine and I’m sure he’ll do whatever he can. I feel we’re
wasting our time here… Excuse me, Lieutenant. I hope we see each other
again under better circumstances. And thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: At any rate, we’ll continue
investigating. I know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to all
areas…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know
this F.Z. who wrote this article here?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: That’s Francesco Zuria. He’s the news
correspondent.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Where can we locate him? Don’t you think
that by offering a reward to anyone who can give us some
information…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Zuria is in Messina. You might try him.
Shall we phone him?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Have you any instructions for me,
Lieutenant? May I return to Lipari?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Yes. With whom did you leave the crate
of cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I left it at the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Pardon me, Sergeant, but when did you get
back?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: About two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And the young lady who was with you?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: I don’t know… She said she had to catch a
train.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Where are you going?… To Montaldo’s?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Then I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Have you read it?… They’re asking for
anyone with information to get in touch with them.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes. I had also thought of going there to
talk with them…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes, you should go.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But then when will we see each other?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I know it’s difficult. But if you go on
like this it will become even more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Please, don’t look so solemn… And don’t
wait for the train to come in.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Please, please leave. I don’t want to look
out of the window and wave to you with a handkerchief.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Go ahead, now say something! I want to know
just what it is we have to say to each other.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro, I don’t want you to come with me, I
don’t want to see you… How can I make it clear to you?…Why did you
come?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I don’t know why. I just couldn’t help
it.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But sooner or later we’ve got to end this
relationship. And it’s better to do it right now.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I have no desire to sacrifice myself… It’s
idiotic to sacrifice oneself… Why?… For whom? If Anna were here I might
understand your scruples. But she’s not…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, Sandro…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t want to sound cynical.
But isn’t it better to look things squarely in the eye?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: For me they are exactly as they were when
we met three days ago – just three days ago… don’t you realize? And you
and Anna… No, I guess they aren’t like that any more. My God, is it
possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so
quickly?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: It takes even less.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But it’s so sad. So terribly sad. I’m not
used to it, I’m not ready for it… You know… I have never been so upset
in my life. Sandro, why don’t you help me?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I think the only way to help ourselves,
Claudia, is for us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, I’m sure it won’t. Move over there.
Let’s make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next
station, get off.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And what about you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Me… I… I… Please leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I work there but I’m really a
stranger.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I tell you this acquaintance of mine
knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: And who is she? Does she work in
Catania?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Yes, she takes care of the garden.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Then it’s impossible for her to know
me. In the villa where I’m at, we have a male gardener.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: So? That’s logical. You see, both being
gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: And what did they say about me?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: They told me that you were a very nice
girl, that you always mind your business… In other words, things of that
sort.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: We have a radio like this, too.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: No, not like this one.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: And why wouldn’t we have one like
this?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Because this is a Chinese radio.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Certainly a radio this small is very
practical. It’s especially useful for… I don’t know… for traveling.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: But for you, what comes first: music or
love?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Music, of course. To get a
sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to
do is buy one.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Ah, no… For me, love comes first. I’m a
man, and I know what’s what: first love, and then music.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Claudia, listen to me…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, Sandro, please… I ask you as a
favor…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Promise that you won’t try to look for me…
you shouldn’t try to look for me any more…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But why, Claudia?… Why?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Even if you chase me away, I… Claudia, let’s
not wait any longer… After, it will be too late … Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Did you have a good trip? It is such a
magnificent day! I am very happy that Sicily is able to give you so warm
a welcome. And you do deserve it. You’re such a lovely blonde. Come, my
dear.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: And where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: From Rome.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Oh, how nice! So, you’re from Rome… And
would you happen to know of some intelligent clergyman in Rome who might
be willing to come here and stay with us? We have our own private little
chapel… It is a masterpiece, with seventeenth-century frescoes… and the
remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful collection… He would find
it very convenient there, and could say his own masses. Then he would
have to spend a little time with my husband, who never sees anyone, to
keep him occupied.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: An intelligent clergyman, Princess? But I
think the intelligent clergymen of today have so many other things to
do.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Well, perhaps one with a little physical
handicap. One who is slightly lame, for example.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Well, finally! We were beginning to get
worried about you, too.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But where did you finally end up?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It was futile. We went all over.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But why does she do these things? I can’t
stand it any more.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But how can you carry on a discussion in
this heat?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is
affected only by the cold.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: And who is this?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: This is Claudia, Anna’s friend… You’ve
never met my husband, have you?</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: By the way, have you phoned him?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: You mean Sandro? I told you already. He’s
not in. At least he’s not at the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Now look what has to go and happen… At a
time when I’ll be needing him. How can we discuss things when we lack
dates and figures?…</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But didn’t he say he was coming here…</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Well, what are you all waiting for? Send a
car out to get him. He can’t be more than a couple of hundred miles
away…</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: To me, the fact that hasn’t shown up is a
good sign. Do you want to bet that he’s found Anna?</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Maybe. But do you know that forty thousand
persons a year disappear in Italy without leaving a single trace behind
them. Forty thousand! Almost as much as the entire population of San
Siro… Raimondo, will you go and see if you can locate Sandro?</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: First let the poor thing have something to
eat.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: It wouldn’t really do you any harm to skip a
meal.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: I’ve never met this Sandro. What kind of a
person is he?… He couldn’t have done her in himself, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Sandro?… Oh, sure… I can see Sandro calling
Anna over to him and saying: Listen, Anna, I intend to get rid of you,
but since it’s so painful and complicated… and besides, I don’t happen
to have a gun on me… why don’t you do me a favor and get rid of yourself
on your own…</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: My God, how could we joke over something
like that! We should be ashamed of ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Goffredo is the Princess’ nephew. He’s
eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know – he
paints.</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All
you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the
same.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: But… where is the Prince?… Is he well?</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: The last time I saw him, the day before
yesterday, it seemed he was well.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Princess, why don’t you sell this villa? I
would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic.</p>
<p><strong>princess</strong>: It’s a little like that already.</p>
<p><strong>first young man</strong>: Who is it, Sophia Loren?</p>
<p><strong>second young man</strong>: Oh, no! It’s some model from Turin
with a low-cut dress.</p>
<p><strong>other voices</strong>: It’s Queen Saroya… I saw her… So, who
could it be?</p>
<p><strong>third young man</strong>: They’ve torn her dress… She’s
almost nude… She ran into the shop to hide herself…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Which one of you is Zuria?</p>
<p><strong>newspaperman</strong>: He’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Zuria?</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Yes. Until proven otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I would like to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Wait a moment. Can’t you see I’m busy?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I phoned you, Chief, because, in view of
the situation… I thought it best…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I came down here to buy a foulard… Suddenly I
realized that little by little, directly behind me, I was being followed
by so many men, and more and more of them kept coming.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Well, I should think so… Dressed
like that.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: But I have always gone around like this,
everywhere in the world. Nothing like this has ever happened to me
before.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Nineteen. My name is Gloria Perkins. I’m
married and a writer by profession. I write in a trance, almost always
in contact with people who are dead. Tolstoi, for example, or
Shakespeare. But the movies also interest me.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: How do you find the men of Messina? Are you
shocked by their warm display of friendliness?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No, why should I be shocked? We’re in Italy,
not Finland.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: And how were you received in Palermo?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: In Palermo I was with my husband. Now I’m
going to Capri to write an article for the Tourist Office.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: She did exactly the same thing in
Palermo.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: If you want to go back to your
hotel… we’re ready to escort you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh, yes, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Do you like her?</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: She costs a hundred thousand lire.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: No, I’m not. Why do you think she does all
this? It’s one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you
bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth, if it wasn’t
for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month’s
salary, well… But you had something you wanted to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I read one of your articles regarding the
disappearance of a girl. I’m that girl’s fianc�.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Oh… I’m sorry I have to rush but I’ve got to
write a story about this thing that just happened… Tell me exactly how
it all turned out.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Now listen, if I had any information, I
wouldn’t have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any
information …</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: As a matter of fact, I’ve already had several
phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in
an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the
pier talking with some strange sailors… Could be she secretly left the
island by boat…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Who knows?… Another one has it that she
entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper
himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don’t know
what in his store… at Troina.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Is that far from here?</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: About fifty miles or so. If you want, I’ll
give you the name of the storekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes… of course… But you should also print
that in your paper… But right away, tomorrow morning… It’s the local
Palermo paper, isn’t it?… I mean, it’s widely read…</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Yes, but why do you think our readers would
be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn’t
print it.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You really must do me this one favor.</p>
<p><strong>zuria</strong>: Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Then let’s call it a business proposition.
Something to round out your salary.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Are you ready? I’m not. That’s all we
needed – a cocktail party… The vitality some people have irritates me!
How does it look?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s divine!</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You say that just to flatter me.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Do you consider that a compliment?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: He wants to show me his paintings. He won’t
let go of me anymore. Poor thing, he must have a crush on me…</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Please, you come too…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But for what reason should I come
there?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Please, do come… Don’t leave me alone with
him. He’s capable of… I don’t know… Have you noticed his eyes?</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Giulia…</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Claudia, come and see. It’s a nude.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: They’re all nudes, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But why all nudes?</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Because there is no landscape as beautiful
as a woman.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: And where do you find the models?</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Oh, there are as many as one wants.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: I thought the model was something obsolete
nowadays. Didn’t you, Claudia?</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: It’s strange how anxious women are to
display themselves. It’s almost a natural inclination.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But how could they pose like that? I
couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Why don’t you try?</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Me… Goffredo, you’re mad! He’s mad.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Don’t you ever paint men?</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: Answer me, why don’t you try posing? I’ll
paint you a beautiful portrait.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: But why me?… Ask Claudia, she’s much more
beautiful than me.</p>
<p><strong>goffredo</strong>: But I want to paint you. You appeal to me
more.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: I appeal to you more?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Giulia!</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: And tell Corrado, too, that I’m here… if he
wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating
like mad, and that at this moment, it’s the only thing that interests
me. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It couldn’t be any clearer.</p>
<p><strong>giulia</strong>: Now what do I have to do to be left in
peace?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to
close the door.</p>
<p><strong>raimondo</strong>: He’s not at the hotel… and he probably
wasn’t even in Milazzo. The room clerk said he rented a car…</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Claudia… Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m not coming.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But then why did you bother changing?</p>
<p><strong>corrado</strong>: Giulia is like Oscar Wilde; give her the
superfluous and she will do without the essential.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: That’s him; he’d die if he didn’t have
somebody to quote. He comes up with quotations like that even at a board
of directors meeting…</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Be patient, I can’t remember
everything.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But it even says what she bought: a bar of
soap! So there’s no point in making believe you can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: “A young female stranger, whose description
corresponds with that of the missing girl, came into my store…”</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: She came and then she left. With him. But this
one won’t admit it. You think I wasn’t aware of it…</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: But if I was carrying on with the girl, why
would I want to give any of this information to the newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know myself.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Fine, that makes two of us who want to
know. In fact, three, with him.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Ah, Lady Amalia, would you be interested in
knowing why I told the newspapers about a certain girl who came here the
other day and then disappeared?</p>
<p><strong>lady amalia</strong>: Disappeared? Who is she? … Where?
When?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: And that makes four. Anybody else?…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You have to be precise. Did this girl enter
your store or didn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Was she blonde or brunette?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Brunette.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Blonde.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: How was she dressed?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: I don’t quite remember. Seems to me she
wore a black dress.</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: He doesn’t look at dresses, he looks at what’s
under them.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Pardon me, but has anyone else been here
asking about this girl?</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: No … I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Any news?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes… but it’s all so conflicting… However,
there is some slight indication…</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Listen… In the paper they forgot to say
that as soon as the girl left here she took the bus to Noto. The bus
leaves from the square, over there. I saw her clearly… I came to the
door to see her off… She was a beautiful girl. Lovely pair of legs!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: You’re from Rome, aren’t you? I knew right
away because I’m from Viterbo… He was a soldier there and so… I don’t
like it very much, here.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Then why don’t you go back?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: Three months.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Well… Thanks for the information.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: It’s better if we present a happy picture,
no?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Tell the Signora Patrizia that we are
continuing the search…and that the Signorina Claudia will manage to
survive somehow…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Did your car break down?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: No. I only want some information.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: We’re searching for a girl of about
twenty-five… Seems she boarded this bus two days ago, in the afternoon…
You should remember her because she was a stranger around here…</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: She was a little nervous… dark-haired … with
a kerchief around her head?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Two days ago… wasn’t there that midwife
on the bus, too? Sure, that’s right, and she was talking to some young
woman …</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Can you tell me where she got off?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: All I can tell you is that the midwife is
from X…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: My God … Let’s hope it was her.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: I only exchanged a few casual words with
her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And do you remember where she got off?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Well…probably at the last stop, which is
Noto.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: After that, you didn’t see her anymore?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: What are you trying to insinuate, young
lady? Why should I have seen her again? I don’t do anything that’s
illegitimate.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, no… What are you saying? I’m not
insinuating anything…</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: And furthermore, my dear young lady…
because you really are a dear, you know …if the story of that girl is
merely a pretext, let us say, to get in touch with her, then I feel it
is my duty to warn her. These things are very, very dangerous,
especially in a neighborhood like this where people occupy themselves
more with other people’s affairs than their own.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Then you should also be able to tell me
where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming
houses?</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: There’s the Trinacria Hotel… or the Regina,
near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>midwife</strong>: Don’t mention it… Pleased to be of service
any time.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Look at that bridge! Who knows why they
even bothered to make it…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Look at that: a factory… a station… and
look at those tracks, all full of weeds… But why?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s late… We should be going.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Let’s get out of here, fast… This is not a
town, it’s a cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Who knows why they all left…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro … maybe it’s best that you go in
alone.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Are you joking?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Don’t think that I want to save myself from
any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna… It’s not that;
it’s that you can say certain things easier if you’re alone. Please,
Sandro, do try to understand me… It would look like I was trying to
influence you, to force you, to control you… and that makes me feel
uncomfortable…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Some cigarettes, please… Do you have any?…
Nazionali with filters …</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: What is it, Claudia?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, Sandro… I’m so ashamed of myself, so
ashamed…I tried to hide myself…I feel so small… I hate myself …</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Does it please you to say such things?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh no… It doesn’t please me at all…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Then why do you say them?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Because what I’m doing is so ugly … Because
if you told me right now: “Claudia, I love you,” I would believe
you…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No… Because then I’d force you to swear it,
I’d force you to tell me an infinite amount of things… and that wouldn’t
be right, it couldn’t be right… It would be absurd.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Good. It’s better if it were absurd. That
would mean nothing much can be done about it.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But just think – the very same things you
had said to her who knows how many times… maybe even just before we
left, while I was waiting outside your place…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: So, even if I did say them, I was sincere
with her, as I am now with you.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I have never seen a woman like you, who
needs to see everything so clearly.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me, but would you mind pulling that cord
for me?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: At one time, all these houses were
convents.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Look! What a fantastic scene! What movement,
what disorder! They were very much concerned with scenographic effects…
an extraordinary sense of liberty…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Really, I’ve got to stop this business with
Ettore… I would like to go back and start working on my own projects
again. You know, I had many ideas…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And why did you drop them?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Once they gave me a job to draw up an
estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a
half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I’ve
been doing estimates for other people’s designs.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m sure you’d be able to design some very
lovely things.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I don’t know about that. And then, who’s
interested in beautiful things nowadays?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Claudia, let’s get married?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What! Get married?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes. We’ll get married. You and I. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What do I say? What can I say? No. At
least, not yet. I don’t know… I can’t even think of it… at a time like
this… Oh, but why did you have to ask me?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You look at me as though I had said
something foolish…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And are you sure you want to marry me? Are
you really sure…that you want to marry… me?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: That’s why I asked you…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: So… Oh, how I wish that everything were so
much simpler… that people could just come together by the color of their
hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9.
That’s a very lovely size. But I’m sorry, I wear size 8.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: But why am I so infatuated with you?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Hurry up now, or it’ll begin to get hot
outside…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes, yes, yes, yes… Right away…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Okay. I understand. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: And you leave me here all alone… in this
hotel room…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: As soon as you’re ready, you can come down
and catch up with me. I’ll be waiting for you right outside on the
square.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Very well. But you must first tell me that
when you go out without me it’s like going out without one of your legs.
Go ahead, have a look around the town all by yourself, but you’ll have
to hobble along on only one leg. And you must also tell me that you are
filled with a great desire to embrace my shadow on the walls… Then you
must tell me… You must tell me that you love me.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But you know it already. Why must I tell
you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: So, you wonder why?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Then I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Okay. In a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: It’s closed. Isn’t there any custodian or
caretaker inside?</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: Nobody there.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But it says it’s open from 9:30 to 10:30.,
and it’s ten o’clock now… That’s a fine way to greet tourists.</p>
<p><strong>coachman</strong>: Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came
here and they all walked around in their bathing suits. So they were
made to understand that it was better if they didn’t come at all.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Are you the custodian?</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: Yes, come right in.</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Go ahead, keep right on singing…</p>
<p><strong>hotel manager</strong>: Excuse me for interfering, but I’ve
heard about that girl… Here in this place one gets to know about
everything… That girl you’re looking for… Why don’t you try asking at
the youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young girls traveling
through here end up there.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I was just coming out to meet you. How come
you’re back so soon?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro …What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, Sandro… Please…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No reason why…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment… You
seem like an entirely different person …</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: And aren’t you pleased?… That way you’ll
have a new kind of adventure.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I was only joking, really… Can’t I make a
joke? And now you’ve got to tell me why you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh, Sandro… I want everything you do.
But…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Did the hotel manager speak to you about
that place nearby?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes, she started to but I didn’t feel like
staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to
everybody…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, Sandro… We should go. Besides, we
haven’t been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna’s father. We
should have at least sent a wire or telephoned… let’s be fair, he must
be feeling awfully lonely.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I don’t doubt it. But at a time like this
we’re the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as
telephoning him… Who knows where he is?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Come, let’s go. Pack your things, and I’ll
get mine ready too.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Well, I’m looking for somebody else and
who do I find but you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Shouldn’t we try to find a quieter
place?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You look so wonderfully tanned.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: And here’s Sandro. Why don’t you two go
upstairs and change?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Yes, we will.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Did you manage to find good rooms?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: They didn’t seem too good.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You should have told Ettore. He always
manages to get what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Ettore must be fed up with me by now.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very
well that he’ll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him
that you’re a worse driver than he is…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: How do you manage to put up with all this
confusion? You always said people bore you.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You shouldn’t always take me seriously.
Actually, I’m used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband;
both of them are like dynamos.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Your mother?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Yes, even I had a mother. She was part
Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis
match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: My childhood, instead, was a very sensible
one.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: What do you mean by sensible?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It means being without money.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: See you soon, then.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You see? Just like a robot.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro, listen… Try not to get yourself too
involved tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Aren’t you going to change?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You said you wanted to quit working for
Ettore.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Sure, that’s what I said…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Wow, it’s ice cold…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Sandro, I’m not coming down.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m too sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Sleep is something one must learn to
overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And
I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed
first, paid a penalty. And we really didn’t do anything. After seeing a
movie, we’d go to a cafe and discuss things for a while… then we’d sit
down on a bench somewhere… listen to some drunkard… watch them putting
up posters or manifestoes…or look at the sheep passing by… or go for a
stroll around the market place… Or else we’d go and wake up some girl in
the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her
name…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: You’re that sleepy, eh? What time do expect
to get up tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Late, very late.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Did you know that when I was a boy I wanted
to be a diplomat? Can you imagine that! Me, a diplomat? It’s strange but
I never thought I’d be rich. I saw myself living in a rooming house,
full of geniuses…</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Instead, I have two apartments, one in Rome
and one in Milan. As far as genius goes, it’s a habit I’ve never formed.
What do you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I look at things differently… But maybe
it’s best we talk about it some other time. Do you mind turning off that
light over there?</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: Good night, my love.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Good night. Tell me that you love me.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Tell me once more.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I don’t love you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: That’s not true. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Well, finally… Come, I’ll introduce you to
my friends.</p>
<p><strong>sandro</strong>: I want to take a look around first… I’ll
join you later.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: Say, I hope it’s understood that starting
tomorrow morning, I’ll need to have you around. If you don’t give me
some figures to work with, how can I proceed?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Patrizia… Patrizia … Where’s Ettore?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: I imagine he must be inside sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Would you please see if Sandro is with him?
He’s not in his room. I’m sorry to disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Ettore…</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Nothing, nothing at all. I was just
looking for Sandro.</p>
<p><strong>ettore</strong>: And you expect to find him in here? Go and
ask Claudia.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Yes, yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Patrizia, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: More or less, we are all afraid.
Especially at night.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m afraid that Anna has come back. I feel
she’s back, and that they’re together.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: But what’s gotten into you?… We would have
known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of
fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise
indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: Now, listen. For God’s sake, try not to
let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get
back into bed.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Just several days ago, the thought of Anna
being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don’t even cry, I’m
afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and
easy, even to deprive one’s self of pain and suffering.</p>
<p><strong>patrizia</strong>: You should never wish to get melodramatic
over anything.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Yes, you’re right. I’m sick and tired of
being like that.</p>
