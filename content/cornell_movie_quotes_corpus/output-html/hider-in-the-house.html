<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: – and it’s been done up so
beautifully, you’re lucky to be the first people to look at it. It’s my
personal favorite of all of our homes.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – then there’s the kitchen, which has
been entirely remodelled.</p>
<p><strong>second real-estate lady</strong>: That’s strange. I what
could be wrong here.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate man</strong>: – in all new houses there are
certain kinks to be ironed out.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s been on the market a while, hasn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Not very long. There have been a
couple of bids already.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Because it caught my eye when it was in a
higher price bracket in the listings.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Oh, yes, well, you know, when
developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.
It’s not like it’s been marked down or anything.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Just reduced.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Sometimes they prefer a quicker
return on their investment.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: This is a terrific entrance hall, What a
welcoming feeling.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: You’ll see that there’s really
much more space than the average three bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, space! – You said the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: How large is your brood?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Two – three if you count the husband.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: We must <u>always</u> count the
husband. By my count there’ve been… four. But I still live in hope.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, Phil wasn’t sure he wanted us to be
this far outside the city. But we have friends around here and something
told me I should take a look at this house. I want to be somewhere
surrounded by <u>green</u>.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: … I just had a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: How’s the new place?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: It’s great. It’s clean and airy and quiet –
there are trees and flowers. There’s still some fixing up I have to do,
but it’s coming along.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: And the rent is okay?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing. No problem. I was really
lucky to find this place.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: All right then. That’s important, isn’t
it? – For you to be in an “up” environment. I’m saying you should
literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It’s
something positive that you’ve accomplished – even if you were forced by
circumstance – something for you to build upon.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: And what about work? Have you had any
more thoughts about what you’d like to be doing now?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Well, I’ve been doing a little independent
contracting, some carpentry here and there, y’know, do-it-yourself-type
stuff. I still find it very soothing.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: I’m happy that you’re working again. As
long as it comes naturally, that’s terrific. You’ve always liked working
with your hands, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yeah, since I was a kid. I had a woodwork
class once when I was… in school that time. Then I learned a lot more
when I was in the –</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: – hospital.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: – institution.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Right. So, you have a new place, you’ve
started working a bit – I’m sure you’ll be meeting some new people.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Actually, I have met someone. There’s a woman
I think I like.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Oh, good – well, I hope you’ll have more
to tell me next time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Neil, calm down.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Neil, don’t leave the back doors open – I
don’t want Holly near the pool.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’d have to get one of those sliding covers
for the pool.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Yes – they’re quite inexpensive
and easy to install.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you mind if we –</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Please – take as much time as you
want.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: … “Julie”…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I hear what you’re saying, but I know what
you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re thinking exactly what I thought when I
first saw this house,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: This – is – the – one – for – us.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Stop knowing me so well.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know it’s at the high end of our range
–</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: High end? Honey, it’s a whole new budget.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: But it’s what we want.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You wanted furniture too, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: They don’t expect to get what they’re asking.
Let’s make an offer.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You want me to bargain at the high end of our
range? – I’ll have a stroke. I’ve got to save all my sweat for my
meeting in three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You could have a pool to cool off in.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s a nice pool, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: And it’s a shorter commute.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’ll be even shorter if I get that new job.
Come on.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Let’s do it. Take a breath and – and if we’re
over our heads, well, we’ll sell it. Philip, this <u>is</u> our house.
You know it is. It’s our house.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All right, but look, we can’t say anything to
this shark lady now, okay? We have to play it real cool.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What if someone else buys it in the
meantime?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey, nobody buys a house overnight – if
someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter
offer. But we can’t look too eager or we’ll get screwed.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: So you’ve seen a lot of houses
then?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Yeah, a bunch, but my mom really likes this
one. She was all excited when she saw it and got my dad all excited when
she told him about it. He’s sick of looking already.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Are we gonna buy this house?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you have enough money?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: We’re going to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s very nice, but it’s still a little pricey
for us.</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Well, Mr. Dreyer, I don’t have to
tell you what an important investment a house is.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Actually, I never recommend property to my
clients as merely a good investment. There are bonds that can serve just
as well. A house for me is a place I want to live and raise my family
in.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I found a cent!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “Find a penny, pick it up, all day long
you’ll have good luck!”</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Look at my coin!</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: Must be a good omen, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Must be.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Dad, we can’t decide unless Rudolf gets to
look too!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?</p>
<p><strong>real-estate lady</strong>: By all means, let’s Rudolf’s
opinion.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Rudolf, get down here!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Oh, gross!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s okay – Rudolf likes the house!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey, c’mon now, get him out of there! – This
isn’t our house yet.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: How were we – were we cool?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Paul Newman in “The Hustler.”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Good – that’s what I was trying to
project.</p>
<p><strong>answer service</strong>: Dial Answer Service?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Hi, this is Tom Sykes.</p>
<p><strong>answer service</strong>: Mr. Sykes? Let me see… there were
two calls for you today. One from Dr. Levine at three o’clock – he’d
like to reschedule next week’s appointment, if possible. And the dry
cleaners called and said your jacket is ready.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. I’ve been real
busy. I just got a new phone installed, so I thought I’d test it. Okay,
Claire, thanks a lot, talk to you again.</p>
<p><strong>answer service</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Sykes.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Come on, honey – let’s go play in the new
house.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Ooh, I like.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And this – is the master bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Oh yeah? Where’s the bed?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Right over here.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Is it a king or a queen?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: It’s a double.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Even better.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Even cosier.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: That’s right – you got the bill this
morning. I put it on your desk.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Thank you – how efficient of you.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: When we move in, everyone’s going to have to
learn to work this complicated security system.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Okay! We have TV! We can all get stupid
again!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: What about cable?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’ll get cable when the cable company is good
and ready – you think you can survive till then?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Gimme a break, Neil – your father just spent
three hours connecting the VCR.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All right, that’s enough for one day – I want
everyone up at the crack of dawn. We have the whole weekend to get this
place in shape.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: ‘“… or I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow
your house down!” And inside their new house, the three little pigs just
laughed –’</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: ‘Who’s afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big
Bad Wolf…’</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: Are you being helped, sir?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I’m looking for some perfume.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: Any particular brand?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Well, it’s for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>salesgirl</strong>: Wife, girlfriend or mother?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh – uh – girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: C’mon, kids, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: “We don’t want to be late for our first day of
school.”</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All right, who ate the last piece of
cheesecake?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hey – uh, excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I didn’t kick this onto <u>your</u>
property.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Phil Dreyer – we just moved in over here.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: I see you have kids – and a dog.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Just keep ’em quiet and away from my
property.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you hear what he said?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He made, you know, a remark.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Honey, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: – And keep my kids away from his property –
who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.
Don’t get in an uproar.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I know. It’s just having to pass muster with
these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s just a dumb game they play. You want to
be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.</p>
<p><strong>neil and holly</strong>: MOM!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Good luck, kid,</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hey. Have a nice time – it’s a good
school.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Bye, Neil!</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: “<u>Bye</u>, Mom – Bye, <u>Mommy</u>.”</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: So, <u>Neil</u>. How’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: I’m Bernard, by the way. Those are cool
Reeboks, Neil. They’re real new, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: They’re really white.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, c’mon, you guys, lay off.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: We gotta break ‘em in for you. You don’t
wanna go ’round lookin’ like a new dil-wad, do ya?</p>
<p><strong>friendly boy</strong>: You met Bernard. Nice guy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yeah, things are moving along, but she’s
still involved with this other guy and it’s a little tricky.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Listen, no one ever said expressing
yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have
to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you.
You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as
that sometimes can be.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: When I was a child… I got used to the
closets. The boxes. The cabinet under the kitchen sink… with that
persistent drip. I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood. Cardboard. I
got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even… even that old
refrigerator in the yard. That smelled like rust and decay. It was safe
in the boxes. It was when they took me out –</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: In the institution… when you were
violent… did you <u>want</u> them to put you in solitary
confinement?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I guess so. I mean, I know I’m responsible
for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone. I
didn’t mean to hurt anyone ever.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: You’re responsible for your own actions
and you don’t mean to hurt anyone. In other words, you’ve done
<u>your</u> best. I’m saying don’t carry the burden of <u>other</u>
people’s actions on your shoulders, because they’re beyond your
control.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Are you still afraid of your parents? Of
them finding you?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: That was years and years ago. They must be
very old now, if they’re still alive.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: No, my parents don’t worry me anymore. I
mean, that’s why I was ultimately released, wasn’t it? I mean, even with
the state closing down the hospital and all. Because I’m able to be on
my own at last. I’m cured.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Why can’t you just drive me to my old school
every morning?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Because you’d have to get up at five a.m.,
would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I could take a cab on the way home.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Here, take this out to the table.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: But there’s this <u>psycho</u>. Really. Mom,
there’s a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>. I don’t know why
they let a psycho even go to school!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How was lunch?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How was your lunch with Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh – great.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, did he hear anything about your
prospects for the new job?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Whose is this? Who left this here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: – A little something for the new house.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, thank you, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: God, your sister’s really hot.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #2</strong>: She is.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: Don’t look at her. Look at the
other ones.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, the neighbors are a little weird –
other than that…</p>
<p><strong>nice man</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Present company excepted – it’s the neighbors
out there to the <u>right</u> who are a bit strange.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah, I caught him <u>looking</u> at me the
other day.</p>
<p><strong>nice woman</strong>: In all the years we’ve lived here, I
don’t think we’ve spoken a word to them, have we, hon?</p>
<p><strong>nice man</strong>: Sometimes when I go to the hospital early
in the morning, I’ve seen him coming home. Maybe he works at night.</p>
<p><strong>nice woman</strong>: You’ll probably see the wife once in a
while at the supermarket. Truly one of the walking dead.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sounds like your normal upper- middle-class
neighborhood to me.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Let’s follow ’em.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: What for, dickweed?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: Grow up, Dreyer.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: You’ve done a really great job with the house.
It’s great!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah. There’s still a lot I want to do. It’s
not quite… the kids aren’t really settled in yet. Even the dog has been
terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we’ve been here. Look, he
hasn’t even come in for his food today.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: So you don’t have anything concrete?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Have you just plain asked him?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve asked him what’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The same thing – his business pressures, the
whole move and everything. He’s frantic about nailing this new job,
worried about screwing over his present boss.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: I’m sure that’s all it is, honey. Maybe you
both just need a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ve tried to get him to agree to one. I just
– I don’t know… I’m getting such weird vibes lately.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Don’t drive yourself crazy. It’s probably
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: Hi, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hi. We’re going to the mall.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Rita, he’s only twelve years old,</p>
<p><strong>rita</strong>: He’ll never appreciate it more.</p>
<p><strong>nice woman</strong>: … No, not really. We do hear of
break-ins now and again, but it’s generally a real low-crime area. We’ve
never had any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Is there any kind of Neighborhood Watch or
–</p>
<p><strong>nice man</strong>: You’re talking to her.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Do you remember who gave us this?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s no card or anything.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I hear things in this house,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All new houses have noises.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: How long does it have to be a new house?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: One day before we know it it’ll be an old
house and we’ll be old in it – and I’ll still be paying for it.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Neil’s still having a bad time at school. I
feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He’s made some friends, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I mean, he’s a smart kid, he’ll get by – he
takes after me. You’re too sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know someone else who’s sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey, I have a lot of meetings in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You never know when, do you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Baby, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Aw, okay.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s the middle of the night, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: A man scared me.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A man? Was it a dream?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Has anyone seen Rudolf? I don’t think he came
in last night.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, honey, I haven’t seen him. Didn’t you
feed him this morning?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: RUDOLF!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Neil, do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Rudolf? C’mere, Rudolf!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Rudolf!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Don’t cry, honey, Rudolf knows how to take
care of himself. I’m sure he’s okay. Maybe he just went on a trip.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Like our vacation? Are we still going?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get
away for a while. Maybe Rudolf got the same idea. Dogs need a change of
scene, too, from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Someone nice will find him if he gets
lost.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I hate it here! I hate it!</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: You didn’t finish your greens, but I’ll
let you have some dessert.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Come on, you know you want some.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: No, not tonight, I have to be getting on
home.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: All right then, if I have to go to school then
I’d better go.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why? I just read your report card. What’s the
point? Stay home, watch some television, we’ll get “Mad” magazine
delivered. What kind of report card do you call this?!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ve been going through a lot of personal
crap, all right?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh really? <u>You’ve</u> been going through a
lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: If you want that baseball jacket for your
birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I have a cold.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What did the thermometer say?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The thermometer’s broken.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He doesn’t have a temperature.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I can’t help it if my homework is torn to
shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Y’know what? I’m ready to cancel our trip. I
really am. I’ve had it.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: And I can’t help having a cold.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What d’you want me to do, Neil? I’ve told you
we’ll get another dog. What does EVERYONE want me to do? You want to
move back? Huh? Would you like that? Should we all just pack up again
and MOVE BACK?!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Give it here, Bernard.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Whoa, check it out.</p>
<p><strong>neil.</strong>: Put it back!</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Nice pen, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Fucker!</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Don’t call me a fucker, you little
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Hey, you’re really clumsy, Neil. Look at the
mess you made.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: FUCKERS!</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Please – <u>please</u> –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I think we got it just in time before the ink
dried.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Whew.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: The pocket’s a cinch – I’ll sew it up for you
after dinner, okay?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Thanks, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, gee, well, thanks for letting us know.
Goodbye. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh boy, I just heard something horrible. That
was Audrey next door. Neil, do you know a boy named Bernard Gunther?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He lives on the other side of the hill, I
guess, so don’t get too scared, but it looks like he was just, I don’t
know, attacked on his way home from school. Audrey heard that he was… …
well, apparently he’s in the hospital now. One of his legs was… They
don’t know if he’ll ever walk properly again.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Would you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey! Was the paper delivered today?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I think so! Didn’t you take it in?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The old incriminating matchbook! Are you
kidding me?! The oldest cliche in the <u>world</u>!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, I’m not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What next?! – A strange bra under my
pillow!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that
jacket. It was <u>Monday</u>. The day you were all day in
<u>meetings</u> again? And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey, you know what I’ve been like lately…
I’ve been a total zombie. I have no idea what that was doing in my
pocket.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, what about <u>these</u>? Do you usually
put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me
right now. Maybe you don’t appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t care, Philip. You want to go chasing
Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Barbara <u>Zelman</u>? I don’t believe
this!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Do you usually pay for Charlie? At “Trattoria
<u>Valentino</u>”?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey, I can’t track of all the meals Charlie
and I have been having. This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that
I’m jumping ship before I’m set up someplace else I could be out on my
ear before I’m ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There <u>are</u> people who do things because
they <u>want</u> to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who told you that – someone on the radio?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Fuck you, Philip.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I thought we’d be happy here.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Honey, I’m sorry, I think the vacation will be
a good break for both of us. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The cab’s waiting!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Where should I hide the car keys?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I don’t know – put ’em in the drawer with all
the Chinese take- away menus.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Did you lock the garage door?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you set the timer switches for the
lights?</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: And how are things with your lady friend,
if I may call her that?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh, fine. She’s gone away for a little while
and when she comes back I’ve sort of resolved to really tell her how
much I care for her.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: That’s terrific. Don’t be afraid to be
demonstrative. You’re sounding a lot more confident than when we last
spoke.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I am. I’m really feeling pretty good. I have
a much stronger sense of how far I’ve come.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: As long as you keep remembering why.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Well, we talked about the whole disapproval
thing.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: The whole disapproval thing. If you allow
yourself to get into a situation where someone else’s potential
disapproval becomes the focal point of your life – then you’re back to a
life of fear, aren’t you? – You’re a prisoner to that again, and that
isn’t much of a life.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: And please, don’t for God’s sake
misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way –</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: No, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: On the contrary – this is tremendous. I
mean, we’re all frightened to death of disapproval and we’re constantly
hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves – and I’m not
saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to
our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty
–</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: That would be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: That would be monumentally stupid. All
I’m saying is –</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: – a sense of proportion.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: A sense of proportion.</p>
<p><strong>store man</strong>: I knew you’d be back for another one of
these.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: You test each one thoroughly?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: You better believe it, buddy. Your average
Rolls Royce doesn’t have to pass as many tests. You want consistency?
You want dependability? You want safety?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Safety?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Listen, you can kick ’em, hit ’em, pour water
all over ’em – <u>nothing</u>. I’m telling you, under ordinary
conditions they’re <u>quiet</u>, they’re nice to have around, they’re
completely harmless – but when you blow this whistle… … then look
out.</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Look at that. You can’t buy better protection
than that. That there is your Man’s Best Friend.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: How are they with kids?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: They’re great with kids. They love ’em. They
eat ’em up. I’m kidding.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: So this really does the trick, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bert</strong>: Friend, that animal will go after whoever’s
approaching the sound of that whistle. And God help whoever it is.
Because that dog will not let up until there’s dead meat on the ground.
Put your faith in that, pal.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Kids, don’t leave your bags in the hall – take
them upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did the cleaning woman come?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah – she did a good job. This glass looks
brand-new.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: The floor has a nice shine to it. Oh God – we
have twenty-two messages on the machine.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Did she water this plant? It looks a little
bent out of shape.</p>
<p><strong>neil and holly</strong>: Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Come look, come
and look, come and look!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: All right, all right – what?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: He was lying asleep at the back of the yard
like it was home!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: – And there’s no collar or tags on him or
nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Can we keep him, Mom, oh, can we? Can we keep
him?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Hiya, sport. Where’d you come from, huh?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Can we keep him?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Sensational. Wednesday is fine, no problemo.
One o’clock at the Somerset Grill – yes, I know it well. Okay then –
looking forward to it. Ciao. Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He wants to see me!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Philip! The senior partner?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: His secretary just confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh baby.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh, hi, this is Phil Dreyer again. Stupidly,
I just looked at my calendar and I’m going to have to cancel Wednesday.
Please apologize to him for me and I’ll call back to reschedule – is
that all right? No problemo? Sensational. Thanks – I’m really sorry.
Ciao.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What – what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I think you should feel like dancing at a
time like this.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You can never bring yourself to do anything
spontaneous or romantic, can you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I bought the house, dear heart – we took the
vacation. I deliver your dreams from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: A dance is for free.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: Oooh, look at him <u>burn</u>.</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #2</strong>: You guys have a loud phone.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hello? Hi, Rita.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Uh huh… uh huh… You didn’t even have dinner
with him first?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Uh huh… uh huh… Well, Rita, if he’s that big
a slob, why are you even bothering?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Rita, I’m going to have to call you back.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>neil’s friend #1</strong>: Put it out, man!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Honey? How did it go? You didn’t call me.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He wasn’t there.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I get to the restaurant and he’s not there. I
waited for forty- five minutes. When I called his office, his secretary
said they thought I had cancelled. I had cancelled! Then I get back to
my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows
<u>everything</u>.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, honey.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Dad! Dad!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Neil, go get some water! Now!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What the <u>fuck</u> did you guys think you
were doing?!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You two get out of here, go on. Your parents
are going to be hearing from me.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: A <u>man</u> started the fire.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Neil, goddamn it, you’re not five years
old!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Neil, you could have burned the house
down!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I don’t <u>know</u> how it started!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: You knew a second ago. <u>Who</u> started
it?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: – A man.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: A man started it? Oh really? You wanna show
me, Neil? Right, okay, here we go, Neil’s gonna show me the man.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: We’re going to go see the man. Here we go,
Neil’s gonna show his dad the man. Come on, let’s go see the man.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Do you see a man?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No man! <u>Go to your room</u>.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Honey – I can’t find those large- size Hefty
trash bags!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: There might be some extras in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I thought I was supposed to stay in my
room.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Get on the other side of that.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Neil, lift up your end.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Honey, it’s not the end of the world. You’ll
call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up. And if he’s
not interested anymore, then you’ll find another company to go to maybe
even your own. You are free now, you are independent.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I’m <u>fired</u>. I’m unemployed. Is that your
idea of negotiating from a position of strength? Clearly any potential
employers have been warned to back off!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s not the case.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates
me.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Things are beginning to come to a head. I can
feel it. And I want everything to be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I’ve cultivated her interests so that now we
have even more in common than ever.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Well, now, don’t go creating some
artificial environment for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Oh no – I mean, she’s genuinely made me more
fulfilled in many ways – and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a
few things, too. What I mean is, I guess I’m still waiting for just that
right – synthesis between us – where everything will be understood
between us without even the need for words.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: It’s not going to happen unless you make
it happen, my friend. You’re going to have to assert yourself a little
bit more. <u>Show</u> your affection.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yeah, maybe you’re right. Everything else is
just an excuse. I’m treating the situation with kid gloves because I’m
afraid of losing her.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I should.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: You have to put yourself out there a bit
more.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Because life isn’t about playing it safe.
Life is about taking risks.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Boy, you really buckle under a little
pressure, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is for the best, you know it is. Why do
my socks keep disappearing!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: “Honey, I’m a zombie, I don’t know whether
I’m coming or going.”</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You’re even sadder and more burnt- out than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u>
opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good.
Without me you’d still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara.
<u>You’re</u> the final straw on this back, baby!</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why the hell is this seat never right!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each
other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Why are you mad at each other?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you
just get up and walk away from him?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, that’s what happens with grownups,
too.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Did Daddy tease you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yes, he did, and I don’t like it any more
than you do.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Where’d he go?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s staying with a friend. Hurry up now,
you’ll be late for school.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Daddy’s gone where Rudolf went and isn’t
coming back!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Holly – that’s not so.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, Holly!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: All right, now come on, everything’s going to
be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: My friends have been expelled. <u>You’re</u>
gonna be my friend now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Must be something in the air.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, Rita. No. No, I don’t want to meet him.
No, Rita. Yes, I’m fine. No, I don’t want to meet him, either.
Absolutely not, Rita,</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Hello, my name is Thomas Sykes, I’m a
handyman. If there’s any work you need done, please give me a call,</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, can I make an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Maybe I could take a look at it now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yeah, that was easy.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Do you do washing machines, too?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Just show me the way.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Everything breaks at once.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Isn’t that always the way?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: So, you’re just kind of a roving –</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: – General handyman, yeah. I do carpentry,
too, painting, almost any odd job around the house. I do housesitting
while the owners are away. In fact, that’s why I’ve been in the area.
I’ve been living very close by. Here’s the part that’s giving you
trouble, but I won’t be able to get a replacement till the stores open
tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh, that’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I’ll call you when I have the part.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, of course I’m upset, Rita. No, I
<u>don’t</u> want to go out.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Look, Mommy, look at Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: “Hi. I’m Mr. Edgar!” Look, Mommy, it doesn’t
even hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, what do you want me to do, Rita – I
can’t just forget fifteen years of marriage. Well, of course I know
<u>you</u> can. No, Rita, I – what was that? – oh, I thought I heard
something on the line.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Look what I found.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you – the only way of making
sure this doesn’t spread is to double-coat it with sealant before
putting the varnish on top.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Was that your dad?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Nah, that’s some guy fixing the living room
floor.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Hello there.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh – hi.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: I’ve been cleaning up my yard, too –
I noticed you do some gardening. Thought you might like these.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Oh – well – thank you, Mr. Stone.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to drop by –
just in case you needed anything.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Here, lemme get that.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Because, you know, I couldn’t help
noticing that we have a lot in common.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Yeah, y’know, both of us with recent
spousal disappearance.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: So where are all your toys?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Let’s watch some TV.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Where are these toys of yours?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: A lot of my stuff hasn’t been unpacked yet.
Here’s the TV.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: What toys do you have?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, look – the new Pretenders video.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Well, thanks again.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Say, this is a nice den.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Whoops. Excuse me, pal.</p>
<p><strong>nasty neighbor</strong>: Okay then, you have my number, gimme
me a call sometime.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: I don’t wanna watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hey, look what’s on cable, Bernard!</p>
<p><strong>bully</strong>: Show me your room <u>now</u>.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, uh – hi… I –</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’m having the floor fixed,</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: And what was that neighbor guy doing here?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Look, I think we should work things out.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I was having a bad day – I lost that job, I
was dependent on other people, I was let down –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: There’s always an excuse, isn’t there?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: I think it’s time I came home now.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: That’s not a decision for you to make on your
own.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No, Philip, I don’t want you coming back
here. And if you want to talk to me – <u>call</u>.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: This is my house.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I apologize for that scene with my husband.
You must have overheard.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: An occupational hazard, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I bet. Going into people’s homes.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: It’s a living.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Do you have a family?</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Uh, no – I’ve never really found the time to
settle down.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You must value your independence.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yeah, I’ve always been able to make my way in
the world. I don’t like having to rely on other people.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: It’s nice that you can make that choice.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I was alone a lot as a child. No one to
compete with. My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest
things. When you’re all alone it’s your own world, you don’t have to
take orders from anybody. You don’t necessarily believe the stories
people tell you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Not me, I fell for it right down the line. Be
a good girl and believe all the fairy tales. He married me because I was
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Because you <u>were</u> pretty?</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: Well, these are good signs – she’s broken
up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a
rapport.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: I <u>know</u>. I just feel that the
relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little
thing could wreck the careful groundwork I’ve laid up till now.</p>
<p><strong>therapist</strong>: I can’t help you if you don’t help
yourself. It’s really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn’t going to help
matters any.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: There’s so much I want to say to her, it’s
all jumbled up in my mind, and I don’t want her to misunderstand –</p>

<p><strong>hider</strong>: Yes, <u>I</u> do understand… … I was thinking
about our conversation the other day – what you said about choices.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: You decided that Philip should stay away. You
made your choice.</p>
<p><strong>hider</strong>: Now things are the way they’re supposed to
be. I <u>fixed</u> things in this house.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on with you –</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: – I don’t know who you are, I don’t know
anything about you.</p>

action.</p>

<p><strong>julie</strong>: Hi, we can’t come to the phone right now –

house.</p>
