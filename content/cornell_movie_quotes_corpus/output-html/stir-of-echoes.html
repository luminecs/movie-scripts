<h1 id="stir-of-echoes">stir-of-echoes</h1>
<p><strong>int a bathroom night</strong>: JAKE, a four year old boy,
sits in a bathtub. The door to thi bathroom is open and his mother is
visible in the background, walking back and forth in the bedroom,
getting dressed to go out. The STEREO is blaring in the bedroom, the
music echoes off the tile in the tiny bathroom. Jake is playing with a
plastic airplane. He answers a question.</p>
<p>****: Sometimes.</p>
<p>****: With my toys. He looks up, but we’re close in on him and can’t
see who he’s looking at. JAKE My… blue sword. No! The one with the gray
tape around the middle. That one. He lands the airplane on the water. He
giggles. JAKE That’s silly. MAGGIE Jake? You all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>yes!</strong>: The airplane takes off again. Jake lowers his
voice to a whisper. JAKE What?</p>
<p>****: My daddy, but he doesn’t know about it yet. He brings the
airplane in for a careful water landing and lets go of it. He looks
up.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: JAKE Can I ask you a question? He
pauses, looks to the door to make sure his mother isn’t too close.
Moving back now, we see that Jake is all alone in the bathroom, staring
at the empty bathtub across from him. JAKE Does it hurt to be dead?</p>
<p><strong>under the water,</strong>: the toy airplane sinks and crash
lands on the bottom of the tub.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom,</strong>: MAGGIE WITZKY, twenty-six or
seven, Jake’s mom, city girl knows how to take care of herself, pokes
her head in the doorway, buttoning up her blouse.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Who you talkin’ to, Jake? He turns to her
and whispers.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>int jake’s room night</strong>: TOM WITZKY, Maggie’s age,
lean and muscled like somebody who works for a living, lies on Jake’s
bed next to his son, reading him a story. Jake is nearly asleep.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I was walking in the night, and I saw
nothing scary. For I have never been afraid of anything. Not very. I was
deep within the woods when, suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair of pale
green pants with nobody inside them! I wasn’t scared. But, yet, I
stopped. What could those pants be there for? What could a pair of pants
at night be standing in the air for? Maggie leans in the doorway and
whispers.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Is he asleep? My brother’s here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tom looks at Jake, who is asleep. Tom
closes the book, turns off the light, and covers his son. He kisses him
on the forehead. Tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor .
Its red light glows. After Tom leaves, Jake opens his eyes and
stares.</p>
<p><strong>ext street day</strong>: The Chicago skyline looms over the
street they live on. Not the suburbs, but not quite downtown either.
Racially mixed. Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room
for a raised voice across the narrow driveways. Bar on the corner, neon
sign – “BERNIE’S TAP.” A HOMELESS GUY rants his way down the opposite
sidewalk. Tom, Maggie, and PHILIP, early twenties, come out of the house
and head down the steps. Tom carries the baby monitor in one hand.
Jake’s breathing is clearly audible on the speaker. Tom’s on the
sidewalk. Maggie, still three steps up, stops and puts her arms wide.
Tom turns around and Maggie lets herself go, falling straight forward.
Tom catches her on his back and carries her piggy-back. She leans around
and bites his ear.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What are the odds of a single woman being at
this thing?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: `Bout a million to one.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Any hot mommies?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Depends. How big you like `em? The hot engine
of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway of the house across the
street. It backs into the street, its passenger door hanging open. The
DRIVER honks the horn and a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another
house and jumps into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy
berates them, shaking his fist. They reach the steps of the house next
door. PARTY NOISE comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom
swings Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around her,
and kisses her. Great kiss. It goes on.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Excuse me, hello, I enjoy soft-core as much
as the next guy, but this is almost like incest for me.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Should we tell him?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Get the fuck outta here! He grabs Maggie and
hugs her. Tom starts up the steps. PHILIP Look at this, I haven’t even
had a second date in a year and a half, you guys are on your second kid!
Philip catches up to Tom and throws his arms around him. PHILIP You big
huggable bear. You’re still goin’ back to school, though, right? You
promised me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t know, I just found out about this.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I’m telling you, if you never go back to
college you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. The memories I have
of being a freshman – those were three of the happiest years of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>int bobby &amp; vanessa’s - living room night</strong>:
TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE are crowded into a living room. It’s loud,
smoky, there’s music and a ton of booze – empty beer bottles, five
gallon jugs of wine, big liter bottles of vodka and gin.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The men are mostly on one side, women on
the other. As Maggie heads toward the women, Tom grabs her arm and pulls
her back close.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Seven years, and I’ve still never been to a
party where you weren’t the one I wanted to hang with. She smiles,
melted, and they part. Tom joins the men. BOBBY, Vanessa’s husband, an
athletic-looking guy holding a sleeping three-year-old on his shoulder,
talks with FRANK McCARTHY, fortyish, big Irish drinker, and HARRY DAMON,
who is also older than the rest.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tom-Tom-Tommy, how are ya? He shoves a beer
into Tom’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Alive on the planet. Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello, Tom. Takin’ care of the place?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Actually, I’m drillin’ holes in all the floors,
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s it, take the medicine deep into your
body. Good, good.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So how you likin’ the neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, I grew up about a mile from here, it
ain’t like a foreign country.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The hell it isn’t! This is the best God damn
neighborhood in Chicago, `cause we look out for each other, and that’s
sayin’ a lot as we approach the Year of our Lord two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you, runnin’ for Mayor?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: LENNY, the local crank, pipes up.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Hey, did any of you guys see those Dominican
crack dealers hangin’ around the park again? Everybody GROANS.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is Lenny doing here? Did you tell him
you were having a party?!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Vanessa made me.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Yeah, laugh it up, laugh it up, and when you
all wake up dead with your throats cut some night –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean, I could see if he just heard the
noise and wandered in, but to actually invite him into your home.. .</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: – don’t come cryin’ to me!</p>
<p><strong>across the room,</strong>: Philip surveys the selection of
females. He sees VANESSA, late twenties, hasn’t lost the weight from the
last baby yet –</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Not attracted to… – SHEILA, a thin, nervous
woman around Frank’s age – PHILIP Not drunk enough for… – and a LOUD
WOMAN with enormous hair. PHILIP Frightened by…</p>
<p><strong>later,</strong>: everyone has eaten, some have left, the ones
that remain are bombed. A DRUNK COUPLE dances dirty. Frank stares long
and hard at someone’s cleavage.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sheila, the nervous woman, stares at
Frank, pissed off. He looks at her, gives her a “What?” gesture. Must be
married to each other. Tom, on the other side of the room, hears a
SHRIEK of women’s voice: and turns. He sees Maggie blushing, receiving
hugs and congrLtulations from the two or three women around her.</p>
<p><strong>in the :itchen,</strong>: Vanessa talks to Maggie while she
mixes up a blender of Margaritas. The room is jammed with people.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: How did you and Tom meet?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: He saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m serious. The summer I was nineteen, I
was at Jones Beach, I swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg. There
was no way I was gonna make it back. I was goin’ down, I was swallowing
water and everything. Tom was a lifeguard. I don’t know what he was
doing out that far, he said he just had a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh my God, did you have sex with him like,
that night?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Had to. He said I’m his slave until I saved
him back.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: That’s so romantic. Bobby and I met when I
peed in the guys’ john at a Bon Jovi concert. She hits “puree” on the
blender.</p>
<p><strong>still later,</strong>: the party’s down to the hard-core half
dozen, who are passing a joint. Tom sits on the couch, feet on the
coffee table next to their baby monitor. Maggie is next to him, Frank
and Sheila are jammed in there too.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Bobby and Vanessa sit on the floor
opposite. Philip is in a chair at the end.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: P weren’t really, they were just, you w,
playing along.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Then how could they have needles stuck into
their throats without bleeding? Without even making a sound?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You never saw that happen.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Uh, hello, I had a two inch needle stuck
right into the thick of my arm, by my professor, while I was under
hypnosis.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You’re making it up!</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I saw his arm the next day. It left a
mark.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Can you learn another word?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yeah, let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hypnotize somebody. Hypnotize Vanessa.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Oh, no. Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Because, I .night make a fool out of
myself! I n. ;.ght, I don’t know, expose myself or sowething. She
clutches her arms around her breasts as she says that. You get the
feeling she’d like to expose herself.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I thought you didn’t believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I don’t, but – do Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You do it, Sheila. We promise not to make you
do a strip tease on the kitchen table. Sheila glares at him. They must
be fun to hang out with.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: That’s what I’d do! That’s exactly the kind
of thing I’m afraid I’d do!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hey Frank, you’re the one who’s so curious,
why don’t you-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Ah, that’s different. Whaddya got to
hide?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No fuckin’ way, I ain’t gonna do it. Tom sits
forward.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What the hell? I’ll try anything once.</p>
<p><strong>a moment later,</strong>: a hand switches off the lamp on the
table. Another hand turns off the lamp in the corner. The music is
turned off. Tom sits in the armchair in the n3arly-darkened room. Philip
shoves the coffee table back and sits on it, directly in front of him.
The others crowd around expectantly, silent.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No sound.from anyone, please. Any
distraction can break it up. He raises his index finger and holds it
about a foot in front of Tom’s face. PHILIP Okay. Look at it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Damn fine lookin’ finger. Laughter.</p>
<p>****: Be quiet. Look at it. Keep looking at it. Don’t look at
anything else, just my finger.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Can you clean out the nail, it’s kinda makin’
me sick here. Philip raises two fingers and jabs Tom in the eyes. TOM
Hey, what the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Shall we try this again?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Look at me, Tom. You’re not afraid of this.
You want this to happen. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Poke me again you son of a batch and I’ll clock
you, I swear to Go’..</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Philip, have you ever done this before?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Maggie, please, I nearly have a master’s
degree in cognitive psy-</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Have you ever done it before?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Well, I’ve seen it done a dozen times.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Try not to screw him up permanently.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You want to be hypnotized. Say yes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: “I want to be hypnotized.”</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I want to be fuckin’ hypnotized, already.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Okay. Close your eyes. As Tom does, our eyes
close too, big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us
into blackness. PHILIP Just listen for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>in the black,</strong>: we can still hear the sounds of the
living room. Tom breathes. Ice CLINKS in a glass as someone drinks. A
car HUMS by outside. PHILIP Now look at the backs of your eyelids. Do
you see anything there? TOM Uh… Out of the pitch black, we can detect
tiny images. TOM Some colors… something floating… up. PHILIP Focus on
it. A small squiggly line comes into focus, drifting up through the
black, then bouncing suddenly downward. PHILIP Now… I want you to
pretend you’re in a theatre.</p>
<p><strong>int theatre night</strong>: We’re sitting in a theatre, a
bare stage at the front. PHILIP A movie theatre.</p>
<p><strong>int movie theatre night</strong>: Okay, we’re sitting in a
movie theatre. It’s crowded with people, waiting for the movie to start.
PHILIP You’re the only one there. The people disappear. The theatre is
empty. PHILIP You’re sitting near the front. We pop up ten rows closer
to the screen.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PHILIP The walls of the theatre are
black, covered with black velvet. SHOOOP! Black velvet descends over the
walls. PHILIP The seats are covered with black velvet. Black velvet
crawls over the seats. PHILIP There is no light in the theatre. The
lights click off. PHILIP In the whole pitch-black theatre, there’s only
one thing you can see. The white screen. You drift toward it, in your
chair. Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move slowly
toward it, floating over the seats. PHILIP There are letters up on the
screen. Tall, thick, black letters, but they’re out of focus. You drift
closer to them, trying to read them. Blurry black letters appear on the
screen. We drift closer. PHILIP You’re comfortable in your black velvet
seat, very comfortable. You just sit there, looking at the screen,
drifting closer in your chair, staring at those letters on the screen.
You’re relaxing. Your feet and ankles are relaxed. Your legs are
relaxed. Your hands are limp and heavy. Your arms are relaxed. Your
face. The letters come into focus, you’re close enough now, you can read
them. The letters are right in front of us now, but still blurry. PHILIP
The letters spell –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The moment he speaks the word, five
giant black letters come into focus on the white screen, filling our
entire field of vision. PHILIP</p>
<p><strong>sleep.</strong>: We stare at that word for a moment – – and
then everything goes black. No sound, no image, no nothing. And
then…</p>
<p><strong>int bobby &amp; vanessa’s living room night</strong>: Six
faces stare right at us from up close. Tom is in the chair, eyes open,
looking disoriented.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Didn’t work, huh? All six faces burst out
laughing, a great nervous tension released. Somebody turns the lights
back on, somebody else hits the music. TOM What? More laughter. Philip
seems very pleased with himself. Maggie comes and sits on the arm of the
chair next to Tom, puts her hand on his face.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Did somethin’ happen? People start talking, all
at once.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You were faking it. You had to be faking
it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That was the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen in
my whole fuckin’ life.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How am I supposed to feel?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: A little.., hot, maybe? EveryboJy laughs
again. Tom wipes his forehead. He’s covered with sweat. He gets up. He
doesn’t like this at all, being the only one not in on the joke.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’d you do to me?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Nothing much. Just had you stretched out as
stiff as a board between those two chairs – He points to two dining room
chairs that are sitting back to back four or five feet apart. PHILIP –
and ran this back and forth under your legs. Tom feels the backs of his
legs. He looks at Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That happened?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You said it didn’t hurt at all. And he kept
it moving.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, thanks a lot, it was very nice of you not
to burn my flesh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joey Ariola woulda burned it. They laugh
again. Tom looks at him, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The kid who beat you up all the time when you
were twelve. You told us all about him. You were cryin’ and
everything.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tom seethes, humiliated. Vanessa looks
at her watch.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not time yet.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What?</p>
<p>****: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Not time for what?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Tom, you didn’t do anything embarrassing or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aright, somebody else go. Come on, let’s go,
somebody else, right now.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Tom, look –</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Nobody? Well, then I guess the party’s over,
ain’t it? Let’s go. Come on, let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: You’re getting a little too worked up about
this.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know, I don’t think so, because I’ll tell
you something, it’s a very nasty feeling to know somebody’s been fuckin’
around in your head for everybody else’s amusement, you know? I mean,
Joey Ariola, Christ, I haven’t thought about him in maybe ten years, and
– come on, man, somebody else has gotta go. Don’t make me be the
only-</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On the mantle over the fireplace, a
clock CHIMES. Everyone is immediately silent, staring at Tom. He looks
at the clock. It’s eleven. He lifts his foot, pulls off his shoe – – and
throws it out the window. There is an explosion of laughter.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Why’d you do that, Tom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I… have no idea. Even more laughter, now
everybody’s slapping him on the back. Tom nods, “yeah, yeah, laugh it
up.”</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I couldn’t resist. Tom cranks an arm around
Philip’s neck and pulls him down, choking him. But it’s playful, his
sense of humor returning.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Any other surprises you left in my head, you
fuckin’ dead man, you?</p>
<p><strong>int tom &amp; maggie’s house night</strong>: It’s dark. Tom
and Maggie lie in bed, awake.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I hope it’s a girl, I can’t help it. Six
brothers, I mean, give me a break. I’m sick of all these balls around
the house. He doesn’t laugh. She rolls over, strokes his chest with one
hand. MAGGIE What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Two kids. I’m only twenty-six. How did this
happen? She slides one hand down, under the covers.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: “Please, baby, please baby, just this one
time, I can’t feel anything with one of those on.”</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, I now how it happened, I’m just sayin’…
You’re gonna have to stop work, at least for a while. I’ll be workin’
Saturdays for at least another year, maybe two.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You don’t have to. We’ll get by, we always
do. Tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How many times I gotta ask Harry to fix that?
He said he fixed this place up, so how come the roof leaks every time it
rains?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Relax. Her hand is moving. He twists.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maggie, you don’t think, I mean, ten, twelve
years from now… I don’t want you to think I’m gonna be a line man
forever, you know, like Frank or somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s a good job. You know how many guys
would kill for your job?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m smarter than that, I know I am.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Relax. She’s making it hard for him to
concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m smarter than Philip, Christ, six years in
college, he’s still got his head up his ass. I just want you to know,
this ain’t where I plan to stop. She licks his ear. He closes his eyes.
TOM All my life, I feel like there’s something better inside me, it’s
trying like hell to get out and it’s like x won’t let it. She rolls on
top of him and whispers.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Let me help.</p>
<p><strong>later,</strong>: the clock reads 2:31 a.m. Maggie is asleep,
Tom is lying on his back, still awake. He looks over at the clock,
agitated. He stares up at the ceiling. He closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>a barrage of images</strong>: races across the back of his
eyelids: – Philip’s face, close to his, a finger held in front of him. –
A flame, leaping out from a cigarette lighter. Six more faces, pressed
in close to his. Himself, floating in an armchair above an empty movie
theatre.</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom,</strong>: Tom snaps his eyes open. He rolls
over onto his side, punching his pillow. He closes his eyes again.</p>
<p><strong>more images come,</strong>: faster this time. We share his
point of view: – A twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a
dumpster. – A fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick
building.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – A vicious dog sinks its teeth into our
calf. – Maggie, drowning, reaches out to us. The images Increase in
speed, a half a dozen flip by so fast they’re almcst subliminal – a car
tire, a broken arm, falling into water, breaking window, ham and eggs, a
bolt of lightning.</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom,</strong>: Tom sits up abruptly, shaking his
head to clear it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: .the fuck, man? He puts his hands to the side
of his head. It hurts. A lot. Maggie stirs, but doesn’t wake up. Tom
gets up and walks out. As he passes Jake’s room, he does a double
take.</p>
<p><strong>in jake’s room,</strong>: the four year old is awake. Not
just awake, but standing next to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at
the open doorway. Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the
nightlight.</p>
<p>****: Jake? The little boy doesn’t answer. Tom walks slowly over to
the boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the boy’s
shoulders. TOM Are you okay? Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his
father’s eyes. The boy’s face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out
with one hand and rests his fingertips on Tom’s forehead.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t be afraid of it, Daddy. The hell does
that mean? But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed,
rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>int bathroom night</strong>: Tom shakes some Advil into his
palm; washes three down with a glass of water. He runs water in the
sink, splashes some on his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as
he wipes his dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then
summons his nerve and closes his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>immediately,</strong>: more images come. – The front of Tom’s
own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN OVERCOAT stands on the porch,
waving to us to come in. – Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and
face. – A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen
through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses. – Wooden floorboards as we race
down toward them. We hit, hard, and our blood sprays out onto the
wood.</p>
<p><strong>in the bathroom,</strong>: Tom’s eyes pop open. That was
disturbing.</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: Tom strides into the living
room. Their house is small, crowded with kids’ toys and furniture they
got for their wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his
hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>in the kitchen,</strong>: Tom rips the refrigerator open and
searches the top shelf. He finds what he’s looking for, a large carton
of orange juice. He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it. He
upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still unsatisfied, he picks up
the carton. He drinks the rest. Juice runs down his chin.</p>
<p><strong>back in the living room,</strong>: Tom drops onto the sofa.
He sits for a moment, trying to regain himself. His breathing returns to
normal. He sits forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table,
points it at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back – – there’s a
woman sitting next to him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She’s eighteen or nineteen years old, so
pale her skin’s almost luminous. She’s attractive but odd, she wears a
billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and down each
wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red- rimmed. Steam rises softly
from her hair and skin; when she speaks, her breath comes out of her
mouth in clouds of vapor.</p>
<p><strong>woma i</strong>: You can kiss me if you want to. Tom bolts to
his feet and staggers away from the couch. The woman stares intently at
him and says something else, but her words are lost under the rising
sound of static on the television.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What?! She repeats, but he can only see her
lips moving, the words are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns
hurriedly toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back – –
the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room, looking all
around him. But he’s alone.</p>
<p><strong>int bedroom night</strong>: Tom crawls back into bed and
pulls the blankets up tight around him. He’s shivering.</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: drops over him and he nearly jumps out of
his skin. It’s Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep. He
takes her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open.</p>
<p><strong>int kitchen day</strong>: Morning. Tom and Maggie sit at the
kitchen table. From the living room, we can hear a-kids’ morning show on
the television. Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform shirt.
Maggie is staring at him. They keep their voices low.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What do you mean, like… You mean like a
hallucination?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maybe. I was awake, I know that. She nods,
thinking, no idea how to deal with this.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Did you, uh, get her name?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know, she didn’t menti. -in it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You sure you weren’t dreami.g?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Positive. I had this headache like you wouldn’t
believe, and I was thirsty as hell.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What should we do? You want to call
Philip?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, I’ll call him. But I don’t think he’s got
a fuckin’ clue in life. From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously
at something on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: How about my cousin Elizabeth?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t need brain surgery, I just had a weird
thing happen, that’s all. Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time deal, don’t
worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Well, if anything like this happens again,
we should go talk to Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maggie…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ext house day</strong>: There’s a pickup football game in the
street, a half a dozen sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their
plays to coincide with the red lights. Tom gets into a pickup truck with
a phone compaty logo on the door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the
neat house. He hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo–s back up
at the front of his own house.</p>
<p><strong>he remembers</strong>: one of the images that blasted through
his mind last night. It’s his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an
overcoat is standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way –
“C’mon in.” But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move slowly
toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>back in the pickup,</strong>: Tom turns slowly away from his
house, just as</p>
<p><strong>the football</strong>: BANGS off his windshield, nearly
breaking it. TWO BODIES hurtle through the air and land on his hood with
a loud metal</p>
<p><strong>clang.</strong>: Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car.
ADAM McCARTHY, seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me! The
kid with Adam doesn’t seem embarrassed, he just reaches for the
football. Tom beats him to it. TOM You gotta play right here in the
middle of the street? Frank is out of his house now, approaching the
truck. He wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over
his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your own
grandfather .</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Aw man, it’s dented. This ain’t even my truck.
They’re gonna dock me for this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’ll pop right out. Use one of them
plunger things. Adam, say you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m really sorry, Mr. Witzky.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There you go, he said he’s sorry, whaddya
want from a kid. Let’s go. Frank gets in the truck. The other football
players walk toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a
great-looking seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom’s
hand. Tom looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hell of an arm ya got there. Kurt smiles and
shrugs. Tom tosses the ball back to him. Kurt turns and catches it
behind his back as he walks away.</p>
<p><strong>in the truck,</strong>: Tom gets back in and closes the
door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That Damon kid, he’s gonna break your old
passing records this Friday.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Bound to happen some time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Comin’ to the game?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, I’m comin’, I’m comin’ HARRY Hey, Tom!
Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is headed toward
him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A police car has turned
onto the block and is rolling to a stop.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is
staring out the window, looking right at Tom. Harry comes up to the open
window and starts talking, but Tom is looking past him, at the Cop, who
has stopped now. HARRY Thought I’d stop by and pick up the rent. Save
you the trip across the street.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s still two days yet, isn’t it? Tom looks
more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn’t looking at him, he’s
looking past him, toward Tom’s house.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, just thought you’d want to get it out
of your hair.</p>
<p>****: Well, my checkbook’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we picked
to miss last night, huh? How many yards Adam end up with? Tom turns in
his seat, following the Cop’s line of vision.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns. Harry
lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is looking at so intently
– it’s Jake, who’s playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while
Maggie watches. Tom turns back, but as he does the police car is just
pulling away.</p>
<p><strong>int signal division day</strong>: The signal division of the
local phone company has a large main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one
side of the room shows a forest of jagged, blinking lines.</p>
<p><strong>in the towers,</strong>: Tom is wedged between giant walls of
circuit boards. He pulls a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a
line at random.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He pulls up the test handset unit that
hangs from’his belt and listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he
cuts in on a</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice.</strong>: VOICE -which was okay, I guess, but
then he told me he loves me, and it was just like, oh my God, can you
please make yourself any less attractive? Tom pulls off the clip and
picks another line. Now it’s a</p>
<p><strong>sneaky man’s voice.</strong>: VOICE -unless they find out we
already locked in with Cooper at eighty, so it’s imperative we lead them
to believe we’re honestly trying to-, Tom clips to another line. It’s a
SEXY WOMAN’S VOICE. VOICE -start at my lips and lick your way all the
way down to my- Tom starts to unclip, then hesitates, only human. The
voice abruptly changes. VOICE Hey, did somebody pick up on your end? Is
your wife there? Tom unclips and picks another line. He gets a dial
tone. He enters a number on his headset. A SLEEPY VOICE answers.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Phil, it’s Tom. Is there anything else
important you said to me last night, while I was under?</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment day</strong>: Philip is still in bed
in his apartment. It’s a smallish place, one wall is all windows with a
lovely view of a factory, its stacks belching black smoke into the air.
Philip’s hung over. He holds the phone like he resents it.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM Quarter after eight. What are you,
still in bed?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Quarter after eight? Jesus, Tom, this is
barbaric.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Other than the shoe thing, what else did you
say to me?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Hang on, lemme, I gotta get my bearings
here… Who is this again?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Phil, I gotta get back to work, was there
anything else you told me to do after I came out of it?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: If you’re asking if I gave you a post-</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Post-hypnotic suggestion, I know what it’s
called, Phil. Did you leave any others behind when you were kickin’ your
big, clumsy-ass feet around inside my brain?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Tell me the truth, Phil!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No, I swear! I went out of my way not to, I
even added a thing at the end to make sure!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I, I didn’t want you to retain any of the
experience, you know, I wanted you to have control back, so I made up
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: God, I don’t remember, I haven’t had
caffeine in almost eighteen hours, how am I supposed to-</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: In general, what was it?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Well, it was perfectly harmless, I just
said, uh, I said “When you come out from under, your mind will be
completely free. There’s nothing binding it. Nothing holding it back.
You will be completely open.” Tom stops, thinking for a long moment.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, I’d say that about describes it.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Describes what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Never mind, it’s gone now. I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Describes what? But Tom has hung up. Philip
unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>int kitchen day</strong>: Jake sits at the kitchen table in
his pajamas, eating a bowl of cereal. Maggie, in work clothes, is
walking back and forth behind him, talking on the phone, finishing her
makeup, drinking coffee, and doing the dishes. MAGGIE Hi, Adriana, it’s
Maggie. Listen, our baby-sitter just backed out on us for next Friday
night – Jake turns and looks at the empty chair next to him. He smiles
at it. Then he giggles. He covers his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MAGGIE – and there’s this game Tom and I
really wanted to go to and I was wondering if…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I told him. MAGGIE Oh. Yeah, I understand. No,
no, no, don’t worry about it. Okay. Bye. Shit. Shoot. Shoot, I mean. She
picks up the phone and dials again. With all she’s doing, she doesn’t
notice that Jake is having a conversation with the empty chair. MAGGIE
Philip, hi, it’s me, call me when you wake up, is there any way –</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: – you’d consider dumping whatever bimbo
you’re going out with Friday night and baby-sitting for us instead?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’d call mom, but it’s a long drive for her
and she’s not feeling very well again, so… call me as soon as you can,
and no, I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Well, that’ll happen in about a million
years.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Call Vanessa and ask her about Dorothy.
i’aggie stops, looking at him. Jake is calmly eating his c•.real. She
looks at her watch.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Good idea. She picks up the phone and dials
a number. Jake just keeps eating. Behind him: MAGGIE Hi, Vanessa, it’s
Maggie. What’s your baby-sitter’s name again, Dorothy? Are you gonna use
her Friday night? Really? Would you mind if I asked her to sit for us,
just this once? Oh, great, thank you so much, you saved my life. What’s
her number? Uh huh, uh huh. Great, thanks again. Okay. She hangs up and
finishes her make-up in her reflection in the toaster. MAGGIE When did
you ever meet Dorothy, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Samantha told me.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, I bet you saw her when you were over
playing with Jessica the other day, right? She was there then? Jake
turns to the empty chair on his left. He looks at it for a moment, then
turns back to Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes. That’s when I met her. He goes back to
eating his cereal. A DOORBELL rings.</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: Friday night. Tom the porch,
about fif answers the front door. A GIRL stands on teen years old,
heavyish wearing a ti , ht pair -3f blue jean s an d a brown leather j
neck. A dull zipped u to g the strea1. of butt yellow ribbon runs
through a her Chair likepa er.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I’m Dorothy. Muller. Tom Witzky.TOM She
shakes his hand limply and steps inside, just to the side of the door,
looking down. Tom stares at her, longer than is Maggie comes forward
with the baby Y monitor and takes ove r, leading Dorothy into the
room.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hi, Dorothy, thanks for coming, remem ber
me? I’m Maggie, we met over at Vanessa’s once or twice. Okay, Jake’s
asleep already and he hardly ever wakes up, a band could play in his
room and he wouldn ’t hear it, so</p>
<p><strong>you</strong>: Shouldn’t have any trouble with him a t all.
His room is right up at the top of the. As she goes on, showing Dorothy
aroundexplaining where they’ll be se and where he is, staring. and so
forththe , Tom stands rooted At Doroth y• A strange BUZZING sound grows
in his ears. He just watchest , h leads back into the living w room,
showing nhers remotes work , that thesTV the sort of thing. sneaks a
look up at Tom, then g. Feeling his stare, Dorothy staring down quickly
averts her gaze again, at the carpet, Th e buzzing fades. dj , no later
t�nGmidnioht’ q if that s okay with you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Great! Let me just grab my coat we’ re out
of here. and</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She runs upstairs. Tom is still standing
where he was. Dorothy sits on the sofa, hands in the pockets of her
jacket, which is still zi pped up to the neck.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: ‘Whir don’t you, uh… why don’t you mak%-
yourself comfortable. Take off your coat. Without looking at him,
Dorothy obediently unzips her jacket and takes it off. Her b reasts are
fuller than one would expect at her age. She l ooks up at Tom, and now
there’s defiance in her eyes. Wh at are you lookin’ at? TOM Excuse me.
He goes upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>int bathroom night</strong>: In the bathroom, Tom drinks a
glass of water quickly, then shakes three or four Advil in to his palm.
In the mirror, he notices Maggie, staring at him from the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where did you find Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Vanessa recommended her. She’s used her
before, she said she’s real reliable. Tom nods. Are you… She’s looking
at the Advil. He smiles, faking it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Too much caffeine, that’s all. He pops them in
his mouth and swallows them dry. TOM Let’s qo,</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: Tom and Maggie step back into
the living room and head for the front door. The mom ent Tom lays eyes
on Dorothy, the BUZZING sound returns, loude r this time.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It drowns out Maggie’s voice as she
gives Dorothy last minute instructions and says goodbye. Tom reaches the
open doorway and glances back inside. Dorothy is looking at him as he
swings the door shut. EXT FRONT PORCH NIf :HT The buzzing stops the
momen% the door is shut. Tom and Maggie go down the steps. Tom lookz
back over his shoulder, at the house, in time to see Dorothy’s face,
peering out between the blinds at them. She releases the blinds and they
snap back into place.</p>
<p><strong>busy street night</strong>: Tom and Maggie walk down a
crowded sidewalk with Frank and Sheila, from next door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t get me wrong, it’s great what the Damon
kid is doin’ and everything, I mean, I’m sorry your record’s gettin’
broke, but, what, it held up almost ten years? Tom is terribly
distracted, looking back over his shoulder, still plagued with a
headache.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yeah, `bout that. They round a corner. Just
ahead, a high school football field is surrounded by bright lights,
mobbed with STUDENTS and PARENTS. A BAND plays on the field, it’s just
about time for kickoff.</p>
<p>****: So you got that, that’s great. What I’m sayin’, though, is this
year it’s all Kurt Damon this and Kurt Damon that, and yeah, the kid has
an arm, but high school football is running the ball – smash-mouth,
in-your-face, power football. Always been that way. Tom glances up at a
mercury-vapor streetlight as they pass under it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The same BUZZING sound, the one he heard
when he first looked at Dorothy, comes back now, seeming to come from
the street light. Tom shakes it off. FRANK Now Adam, and I admit, L am
biased, but my kid is having ona hell of a dy noticed. If they’d just
give him he carries he could break a thousand yards. And on an eight
game schedule! He pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump,
offers one to Tom, who declines. A SEXY TEENAGE GIRL walks past. Frank
notices. Carefully.</p>
<p><strong>behind them,</strong>: Sheila and Maggie walk together.
Sheila stares at Frank as he ogles the teenager.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Look at him. Why doesn’t he just lick them
when they walk by?</p>
<p>****: According to Tom, the average guy carries around a hard-on two
and a half hours out of every day. What are you gonna do?</p>
<p>****: I’ve got a few ideas. A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walks past and Frank
gives her the big crank-around. SHEILA Look at that! He’s not even
picky. I swear to God, that man will stick it in a bowl of soup if it’s
still warm.. Maggie notices Tom, up ahead, with a hand to his temple.
She catches up.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Are you okay? He forces a smile. They head
into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium.</p>
<p><strong>in the tunnel,</strong>: Frank raises his voice still higher.
It becomes a horrible drone to Tom.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Six eighty-three with three game.- left, he
only needs to average, ti.iat, a hundred and five, hundred and six yards
a game? He hits a thousand and we’re talkin’ major scholarships, the kid
could write his own ticket. That kinda thing’s good for everybody, helps
the whole neighborhood. He’s goin’ a hell of a lot farther than I ever
did. Look at the quality of the tail he’s already gettin’. He passed me
in that department when he was about fourteen. He passes Tom the bottle.
This time, he takes a swig.</p>
<p><strong>ext football field night</strong>: They come through the
tunnel and into the stands. Below, the field is brightly lit. Frank’s
voice is, thankfully, drowned out by the enthusiasm of the crowd. They
make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers and sit down.
The crowd is delirious with anticipation, and a bit loaded – there’s a
lot of schnapps in that crowd, and beers snuck in here and there. And
that’s the grown-ups.</p>
<p><strong>on the field,</strong>: the visitors kick off.</p>
<p><strong>in the stands,</strong>: the crowd ROARS. Tom tries to
concentrate on the game, but he’s totally distracted. He looks to the
right, drawn by a flash of light. A car is pulling into the parking lot
at the end of the field with its high beams on. Tom stares at the
lights. The BUZZING sound comes back, louder the longer he stares. The
crowd ROARS its approval of something. Tom turns back, tries to follow
the game. He wipes sweat from his forehead. Maggie is staring at him.
She takes his hand and leans over, SHOUTING into his ear.</p>
<p><strong>what’s wrong?</strong>: As Tom turns to her, his eye is drawn
by something just over her head. A GIANT LIGHT STANCHION towers over
them. When Tom sdirectly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni
overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his ears – – and
he leaps to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sf”S TAXING BIM AWWAY!</p>
<p><strong>what?!</strong>: Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing
right over people. They SHOUT their objections.</p>
<p><strong>int tunnel night</strong>: Tom races down the now-empty
tunnel. A light shines at the far end, BUZZING madly. A few seconds
later, Maggie starts into the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Tom, wait!</p>
<p><strong>ext busy street night</strong>: Tom bursts out onto the busy
sidewalk, threading his way between PEOPLE and cars as fast as he can.
Maggie follows a few moments later.</p>
<p><strong>ext our block night</strong>: Tom races around the corner and
onto his block. He bolts across the street, forcing a car to lock `em up
at the last second. The Driver SHOUTS: Tom keeps running. He reaches the
sidewalk just in front of his house and stops in his tracks, staring at
the house, wild-eyed. All the lights are off.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, no. He bounds up the steps and tries the
door. It’s locked. He fumbles in his pockets for the keys.</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: Tom unlocks the door and
bursts inside.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jake?! No answer. He races up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>int jake’s room night</strong>: Tom SMACKS open the door to
Jake’s room and flicks on the lights. In Jake’s bed, the covers are
pulled back, the sheets are rumpled. But Jake Js gone. Tom races out.
Still staring at that empty bed, we can hear other doors in the house
being thrown open, lights being switched on, and Tom’s outraged voice
calling out for his son.</p>
<p><strong>ext street night</strong>: Maggie comes hurrying up the steps
of the porch just as the front door flies open.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What the hell is the-</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She took him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, my God! She bounds up the steps, calling
out for Jake.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She can’t be that far! He runs to the corner,
desperate, and looks up and down the street in both directions. There
are a lot of people out, she could be anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He turns, looks up and down the side
street. Nothing in the first direction, but when he looks the other way,
he hears a faint BUZZING sound in the distance. He doesn’t hesitate,
just takes off toward it.</p>
<p><strong>two blocks ahead,</strong>: Tom is running as hard as he can.
He stops, abruptly. The buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right.
Behind a wall, there is a large parking lot filled with buses. He turns
around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of the place on the
corner. He looks up, at the sign. It’s a Greyhound bus station. Tom
hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie comes running
up from the opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Wait right here, keep your eyes open! He opens
the door and goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>int bus station night</strong>: Tom steps into the station,
still breathing hard. The BUZZING sound returns. But from where? Is it
in his mind this time, or really here, in the bus station? The place is
empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden bench with their back
to him, near the departure doors. Tom walks slowly across the place to
the figure. It’s Dorothy. As he draws closer, he sees Jake’s face, over
Dorothy’s shoulder. Jake’s eyes are open, and he’s staring up at the
ceiling. Tom follows his son’s gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,
the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its cancerous look.
The tubes BUZZ loudly. It’s the sound Tom’s been hearing. Jake sees his
father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his lips – “Shhhh.” Jake yawns,
closes his eyes, and drops his head onto Dorothy’s shoulder. He goes
back to sleep. Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is
SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme. She looks up suddenly and sees
Tom. She starts to jerk to her feet. Tom puts a hand out – take it easy.
Dorothy sits back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds
both his hands out, palms up.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Give him to me. She shakes her head no.
Outside, a SIREN WHINES and a police car flashes past the window, its
red lights spinning. They both hear it and glance over, then look back
at each other. Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means. TOM Give
him to me, Dorothy. Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms.
Tom gently takes the boy from her and holds him tight. The front door
flies open and Maggie races inside. Tom gives Jake over to her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Oh, hi, Mommy. She’s relieved, but livid.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What the hell is the matter with you?!
Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that leads to the
back, where the buses leave from.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Take him home! I’ll be there as soon as I can!
He runs after Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>ext parking lot night</strong>: Dorothy races out of the bus
station and into the forest of parked buses. Tom comes out a few seconds
later, giving chase. Dorothy cuts between two parked buses – – and is
nearly hit by a third that’s just arriving. Its horn BLARES as she trips
and falls to the ground, the bus just missing as it ROARS past her. Tom
reaches her. Dorothy writhes on the ground, sobbing, raking her hands
through the gravel, hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sit up. Sit up, I want to talk to you. She
manages to drag herself into a sitting position. She shoves back,
against the wheel of a bus. Beyond them, the bus that nearly hit her
stops on the far side of the lot. Dorothy is quivering, still crying.
Tom squats in front of her, a few feet away. TOM Why were you taking my
son?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Do you want me to call the police? Then tell me
why you took him.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He isn’t safe in your house.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: He told me! He told me so! The DRIVER of
the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus now. He SHOUTS at them
from the other side of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jake said that? What else did he say?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Nothing. I was sitting there, I was
watching him sleep, I was just watching him, like I’m supposed to, and…
and he sat up in bed, he looked right at me, and he said “I’m not safe
in this house.” Two times, he said it, and then he went back to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where were you taking him?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: California. To my father’s house. My real
father, not – – Duane. Jake would be safe at my father’s house, we’d
both be safe there.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You too? Why aren’t you safe here? She doesn’t
answer. The Driver is coming over to them, still</p>
<p><strong>shouting.</strong>: TOM Dorothy? Dorothy, why aren’t you safe
here? The Driver is still closer. Frightened, Dorothy gets up, to run
again. Tom grabs her. TOM Hey, wait a sec- As his hands close around her
arms –</p>
<p><strong>an image</strong>: flashes through his mind. A MAN’S FACE,
sweaty and unshaven, leers over us, too close.</p>
<p><strong>in the parking lot,</strong>: Tom abruptly pulls back from
Dorothy. He is enraged.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who is he?! She just looks at him, frightened.
He shakes her, violently. TOM</p>
<p><strong>int dorothy’s house night</strong>: DUANE, fortyish, slouches
on a sofa, watching Moe hit Curly with a rake. Duane’s drinking bourbon.
In his defense, he is using a glass. Duane’s face is the one Tom just
saw in the image in his mind.</p>
<p>****: d16 - - � — .. - - A86i -</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Duane hears the front door open and
close.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: You’re early. Your mom’s still at work. Hey,
do you know if she bought any more who the fuck are you? Tom is storming
across the room toward him. DUANE Hey hey hey hey HEY! Tom already has
Duane by the collar. He wrenches him to his feet. DUANE</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Are you Duane?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Who?! I don’t even know who you’re- Duane
looks over Tom’s shoulder. Dorothy is standing in the doorway,
frightened. DUANE Dorothy, who the fuck is this guy?! Tom hurls Duane
across the coffee table, knocking over Duane’s bong. Duane hits the
floor hard. He starts fumbling in his pocket, but Tom is on him, ripping
him to his feet again.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s a little girl, you son of a bitch! She’ s
fifteen years old, and you fucked her!? What the hell is the matter with
you?! YOU DON’T DO SHIT</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Look, man, I don’t know who you are or what
she told you, but- Tom hurls Duane across the room. He SMASHES into a
bookcase, breaking the glass shelves and knocking a bunch of pictures
and knickknacks to the ground. Duane SCREAMS, tries to roll away to
escape Tom, but Tom picks him up by the back of his collar and his belt,
like a dog.</p>
<p><strong>get out!</strong>: He hurls Duane toward the stairs. Duane
CRUNCHES down hard. Before he can get up, Tom hauls him to his feet and
hurls him furthe: up. He’s kicking Duane’s ass up the stairs. ttom,
Dorothy watches, her hands over her mouth. She’s thrilled.</p>
<p><strong>at the top of the stairs,</strong>: Duane lands, a few feet
ahead of Tom. This time he’s got a second or two, and he manages to dig
the butterfly knife he was groping for out of his pocket. He whips it
around, opening it, but Tom is fast and crazy with rage, he just grabs
the thing by the blade and rips it away from Duane. Blood flows over
Tom’s knuckles as he tightens his grip on the knife. He twists it
around, holding it by the butt. There’s madness in Tom’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You got ten minutes. Pack your shit. You don’t
leave a note, you don’t try to call, and if you ever, ever come back
here again, I’ll know, I’ll find you, and I’ll stick this so far into
you they’ll never get it out. You got it? Duane nods, terrified.</p>
<p><strong>down in the living room,</strong>: Dorothy sits on her hands
at the edge of the sofa, waiting nervously. Tom comes down the stairs.
He folds the knife, uncertainly, never handled one of these things
before. He shoves it in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll stay until he’s gone. Upstairs, dresser
drawers SLAM, Duane CURSES. He’s packing. TOM Shouldn’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: You’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She hurries into the kitchen. Tom looks
around, at the mess he’s made. He’s embarrassed, frightened by his own
rage. Dorothy comes back with a dish towel. She takes Tom’s hand, wipes
the blood away and wraps the towel around it. DOROTHY Than : you. He
starts to pick up the things that were knocked off the bookcase.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Tell your mother I’ll pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: It’s okay. He picks up a framed photograph.
Broken glass falls out of the frame as he turns it over. Tom freezes.
DOROTHY What’s the matter? Tom just stares at the picture. DOROTHY What?
Tom turns the picture around to show Dorothy. The woman in the picture
is about eighteen or nineteen, bears a faint resemblance to Dorothy – –
and is the same woman he saw in his living room. DOROTHY Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who is this woman?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: My sister.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Did she have a black dress, kind of a diamond
pattern on it?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She wore a lot of bracelets, those thick ones,
different colors, all up and down her arms?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yeah, all t2;+ time, she probably still
does. How d., you know that? Upstairs, there is a tremendous SLAM as a
closet door closes and Duane SHOUTS. DUANE</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Can I talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: She ran away. About six months ago.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Where did she go?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: I don’t know! She don’t write or nothin’.
Tom looks down at the photograph again.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s your sister’s name, Dorothy?</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Samantha.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Samantha?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s what she said.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Where have I heard that name before?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Dorothy said she ran away about six months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: But she could still be around! Hiding or
something. I mean, she could have actually been here when you saw
her!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: If she was, she’s very quick getting in and out
of a room.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Where was she? When you saw her, where was
she exactly?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: On the cushion right next to you. Maggie looks
down at the empty half of the couch, freaked out. She pulls in closer to
him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What was it like? At the game, I mean, how
did you know about Jake? Did you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It’s hard to explain. I just got this –
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Like when I was drowning?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: A little bit. But a hundred times stronger.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Does it hurt when it happens?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Like you wouldn’t believe. Fecls like my brain
is tearing in half.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: God, Tommy, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why do you assume it’s bad? Maybe this is a
good thing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: If your brain is tearing in half?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I told you there was somethin’ in me. Maybe
it’s comin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I like it better in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Just roll with it. What’s the worst that can
happen?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’ll go insane. Kill yourself. Kill me and
Jake first.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, yeah, that…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I want you to go see my cousin Elizabeth.
Make sure there’s nothing wrong. Just tell her about the headaches,
that’s all she needs to know, you don’t have to bring up the other
stuff. Suddenly, he smiles.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, know what? It is a girl. She furrows her
brow, “how do you know?”, then follows his gaze down to her belly, where
his hand is resting.</p>
<p><strong>int hospital corridor day</strong>: Tom, dressed in a
patient’s gown, walks down a hospital corridor with DR. ELIZABETH
NOONAN, fortyish. Elizabeth makes notes on a clipboard, walking and
talking fast, all business. Elizabeth does not have the human touch.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do you have any metal plates in your
skull?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Any shrapnel lodged anywhere in your
body?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No cardiac pacemaker, I assume – iron
filings near your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You don’t work with sheet metal, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Left here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They turn down another corridor.
ELIZABETH Do you have an inner ear transplant?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Aneurism clips in your brain?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do you suffer from claustrophobia?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Only in, like, really small spaces.</p>
<p>****: You have a great sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Right, then jog left. They do.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Do we really gotta do this?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’ve had no head trauma, no serious
viral infections you can recall, you haven’t been out of the country,
you’re not a drug user, you have no history of migraines… I suppose I
could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to
do, but I’d rather take a few pictures first, wouldn’t you? She pushes
through a set of double doors.</p>
<p><strong>int mri room day</strong>: The MRI machine is a long tunnel
with a body slab sticking out obscenely, like a tongue. TWO NURSES stand
on either side of it. One wall of the room is glass, behind the glass
are the TECHNICIANS – and Maggie, who waves supportively. Tom
swallows.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How’s it work? Elizabeth goes to a computer
terminal and types in some commands.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It creates an electromagnetic field
thirty thousand times stronger than the earth’s. That stimulates your
brain’s protons to align themselves. Then we shoot radio waves into you,
which knocks the protons out of alignment. They then realign themselves,
sending out radio signals we record on the scanner. The computer reads
the signals and makes a series of detailed cross-sections of the layers
of tissue. Tom looks at the machine, then back at her.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Can I have another Valium?</p>
<p><strong>a few minutes later,</strong>: Tom lies down on the “tongue.”
The Nurses wrap sheets around his arms and tuck them in under his body,
immobilizing them. He looks at one of them questioningly.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: So your arms don’t touch the sides of the
machine.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That would be bad? She smiles and nods. The
other Nurse puts a white cloth over his hair.</p>
<p><strong>nurse 2</strong>: Your party hat. He tries to smile, but he
is unnerved. Elizabeth leans in, staring down at Tom.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s so nice you and Maggie finally came
to see me at work.</p>
<p><strong>in the control room,</strong>: a Technician hits a series of
switches.</p>
<p><strong>in the mri room,</strong>: the tongue starts to move, sliding
into the tunnel. Tom lies still, staring upward as he is pulled inside,
like a corpse in a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue.</p>
<p><strong>inside the machine,</strong>: it’s only about two feet
across, and less from top to bottom. Tom blinks, staring up at the
ceiling as the tongue comes to a stop. It’s incredibly
claustrophobic.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Kinda hot in the coffin. ELIZABETH’S VOICE
comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Yo, hey, hey, woah, I’m right here. Can you
turn it down a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>in the control room,</strong>: Elizabeth leans back from a
microphone and turns to a Technician.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Go ahead. The Technician enters some
commands on a keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>in the mri room,</strong>: the giant “hammers” that are
contained in the cylinders that surround the tunnel start to move,
slowly at first.</p>
<p><strong>in the control room,</strong>: Elizabeth turns to Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Did he bring any music?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, right here. She hands him a cassette.
Elizabeth puts it into a tape deck and pushes “play.”</p>
<p><strong>in the mri room,</strong>: the hammers pick up speed, and
these things move. It gets noisy fast.</p>
<p><strong>in the tunnel,</strong>: Tom’s eyes widen. The hammers whip
faster. Their POUNDING is tremendous. Tom’s music starts playing from
the speakers. It’s The Doors, “People Are Strange.” The hammers whip
faster. Elizabeth was right, it’s good the music is loud, because the
sound coming from the hammers is deafening, like gunshots going off all
around his head.</p>
<p><strong>hour or so.</strong>: Tom, in spite of himself, bursts out
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>in the control room,</strong>: they can hear the thundering
hammers, the blaring music, and above it all, Tom’s crazy kind of
laughter. Elizabeth looks at Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>int control room day</strong>: Three electronic screens, two
red and one whitish-blue, display various cross-sections of Tom’s brain.
Graphs and columns of numbers are listed alongside.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No tumors, no growths, no scars or
lesions, no intrusions or damaged tissue of any kind. Except for one
tiny abnormality, your brain anatomy is textbook. Physically,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What abnormality?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, it’s so insignificant it’s hardly
worth mentioning. She leans forward to one of the screens and points to
a spot on a cross-section. ELIZABETH It’s the parietal lobe. Here.
There’s a slight distension, just the tiniest bulge here in the arc of
the crescent. That’s uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: How uncommon?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: One in a half million, maybe, it doesn’t
really have a name. But it isn’t consequential. Wouldn’t have any effect
on cognitive processes.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Great. There’s nothing wrong with me, I gotta
get back to work. Thank you for everything, Elizabeth, I owe you a giant
one, hey, you think I can get some of that Valium to go? Elizabeth
scowls at him. TOM Worth a try. Take care, say hi to Michael. I’ll pick
up Jake, I told him I’d take him to the Pier tonight. He heads for the
door, eager to get the hell out of there. Maggie lingers, looking at
Elizabeth, hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: There’s really nothing wrong with him?
Nothing at all?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Maggie. I said nothing physical.</p>
<p><strong>int bedroom day</strong>: Maggie is in the bedroom, cleaning
up. She picks up Tom’s pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over
one arm. Something THUNKS to the floor. She picks it up. It’s the
butterfly knife, the one he took from Duane. She stares at it,
fascinated and frightened. She lets it drop open. There is dried blood
on the blade. Gingerly, she closes it again. She opens a drawer and puts
it in, then thinks better of that. She takes it out again, looks for a
place to put it. She drops it in her purse and zips it shut. She’ll deal
with it later.</p>
<p><strong>ext navy pier night</strong>: Navy Pier is an amusement
park/shopping mall built on a pier jutting out into Lake Michigan. It’s
a nice night, the pier is crowded, just enough urban edge to be
interesting. A figure bobs along above the crowd – Jake, sitting on
Tom’s shoulders. They stop and join a CROWD watching a JUGGLER, a good
one, keeps five burning pins in the air. Jake suddenly looks up,
confused by something. He stares past the juggler, through the flames.
Behind the juggler, a UNIFORMED COP is staring at the little boy – it’s
the same Cop who was parked outside their house earlier. Jake stares
back, the flaming pins flying up between them. Tom moves on, his boy
still on his shoulders. The Cop turns and watches them go. Jake turns,
looking back over his shoulder at the Cop. The Cop raises a hand and
waves. Jake just stares.</p>
<p><strong>at a toy store,</strong>: there is an elaborate model train
set on display in the window.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Daddy, look!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Woah, check it out. He stops, helps Jake down
off his shoulders. Jake presses right up against the glass, staring at
the train as it circles the track. Tom squats, admiring it with him.</p>
<p><strong>behind them,</strong>: the Cop is still watching them. He
walks closer, stops only about ten feet away, staring. Tom glances up,
sees him, thinks nothing of it. The ’op steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>in the. window,</strong>: Tom sees the reflection of the Cop.
Closer now, staring. Tom turns and smiles, tight-lipped. He recognizes
him from the other day. The Cop smiles back, doesn’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, look at that one! He carries Jake to the
next window over, a different display. The Cop wanders closer. Tom
finally turns to him, tense. TOM How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Fine, fine. He’s staring at Jake.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Is there a law against lookin’ in the window
now?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Huh? Oh, no, `course not. I’m off duty. I live
right up there.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s great. See ya later. He sweeps Jake up
onto one hip and starts to walk away.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: It’s even stronger in him than it is in you.
Tom stops. Turns back.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What? The Cop smiles and makes a face – “you
heard me.”</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Jon’t be afraid of it. Tom just star .s at the
Cop, trembling slightly. The Cop walks forward. Fascinated, Tom does not
back away. The Cop lowers his voice. COP You’re not alone. Tom is too
rattled to speak. COP You don’t know about Cacophony yet? Tom shakes his
head no. The Cop pulls out a note pad, scribbles something on a page,
tears it out and holds it out to Tom. COP Come next time. His hand
shaking, Tom accepts the paper. The Cop reaches out and tousles Jake’s
hair. COP Bye, Jake. The Cop turns and walks away.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Bye, Neil! The Cop looks back over his
shoulder and smiles. Tom looks at his son as if he’s never seen him
before.</p>
<p><strong>int jake’s room night</strong>: Jake, fresh from a bath and
in his pajamas, sits on the floor of his room, playing with model cars,
intent. He’s HUMMING a soft tune to himself, the same one he hummed
during his bath in the opening. Tom and Maggie sit near him, staring at
him. They’re freaked out. What have they got on their hands here? Their
tone is soft, gently probing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Jake, do you remember the other day when we
were talking in the kitchen? Jake doesn’t look up, just keeps playing
and HUMMING. MAGGIE I was loo3.ing for a baby-sitter, remember? And you
said “Samantha” told you about Dorothy. Do you remember that? He keeps
playing, HUMMING.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jake? Mommy’s asking you a question.
Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Is Samantha someone who talks to you
sometimes, Jake? No answer. She tries a different route. MAGGIE Can you
remember any of the things that Saman- Jake looks up sharply.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t ask the boy any more questions. They
freeze, staring at him. His tone was odd. And did he just refer to
himself in the third person? JAKE Talk to me. He goes back to playing,
and to that little tune. It’s becoming rather haunting. Maggie and Tom
look at each other. Good God.</p>
<p><strong>int bedroom night</strong>: Nighttime. Tom and Maggie are
asleep in bed. Suddenly, Tom’s eyes pop open.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She’s downstairs. He sits up. His head is
killing him again. There’s a glass of water on the night table. le grabs
it and drinks greedily. He turns and looks to the open -loorway. He
swallows. He stands up. He looks down at Maggie, who’s still sound
asleep. He walks to the door. Maggie stirs, feeling him gone.</p>
<p><strong>int hallway night</strong>: Tom walks down the narrow
hallway, toward the staircase at the far end. He’s scared. He starts
down the stairs. Halfway down, he dares a look through the wooden posts
that support the handrail. Samantha is standing in the middle of the
room. She looks up at him. For a long moment, they just stare at each
other. Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes. Tom is shaking,
barely finds his voice.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Samantha? She speaks, but when her voice comes
out it’s horrible and distorted – muffled in a strange way. He takes a
few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her. She walks forward a
step or two. She speaks again, louder, but the voice is still
unintelligible and bizarre. Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs. She
reaches out a hand. He stares, terrified. The hand draws closer. Almost
beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand. She comes closer. Tom
is frozen at the bottom of the stairs. Their hands draw closer still.
Their fingertips touch.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tom GASPS, as if something very heavy
were put down on his chest. His mouth drops open, his chest twitches. He
can’t breathe. They stand there, frozen in that position. Tom tries, but
can’t draw air. MAGGIE’S VOICE calls out from the top ci the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Tom? He can’t answer. He’s panicked, but
unable to move. With every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst
from his mouth, all the air going out, none coming in. From the top of
the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing there, hand outstretched into
the darkness, touching nothing. But from Tom’s point of view, he’s
touching fingertips with Samantha. He’s frozen, breathless, and now his
cheeks start to turn pale, unnaturally white. Another few seconds of
this and he’ll pass out. MAGGIE Tom!? She races down the stairs.
MAGGIE</p>
<p><strong>tom?!</strong>: Tom can’t look at her, can’t move. A tear
rolls down his cheek as his lips begin to turn blue. MAGGIE TOM, BR.
ATfHE! She grabs hold of him. As soon as Maggie makes contact, Tom
collapses. He sees Samantha break away from him with a SHRIEK of
irritation. She moves, not quite walking, but a herky- jerky kind of
lateral movement toward the dining room, fast, like someone on a dozen
espressos, an angry thing that has to slow itself down to a crawl just
to talk to us. In the dining room, she flops over onto the floor, like a
reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond. Into the floor,
she disappears. Maggie grabs Tom’s face and turns it toward her. He
takes a big lungful of air.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MAGGIE Was she here?! Tom nods, sucking
air greedily. MAGGIE Why?!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I think we better find out.</p>
<p><strong>ext our block day</strong>: It’s a street party, and it’s
jammed. Police barricades are at both ends of the block. Half barrels of
beer sit in big plastic garbage cans, ice dumped over them. Everyone
seems to have agreed on which radio station to listen to, and most of
the couple dozen cars parked in the driveways have their radios tuned to
it, loud, the windows hanging open. Outside Bernie’s Tap, the bar on the
corner, a DOZEN DRUNK GUYS are running pass patterns out the front door,
cutting left at the mailbox, and catching a football thrown from inside
the bar, out an open window. Well, they don’t actually catch the
ball…</p>
<p><strong>at one of the taps,</strong>: the Homeless Guy we’ve seen on
the street a few times is drinking right out of one of the beer taps
while nobody is watching. Lenny, the local crank we met before, is
outraged.</p>
<p><strong>hey, get the hell away from there!</strong>: He chases him
off, trying to kick him in the ass but spilling his own beer in the
process. LENNY You see what I’m talkin’ about?! You see what I
mean?!</p>
<p><strong>on a front yard,</strong>: Jake plays with a couple other
NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS.</p>
<p><strong>at another keg,</strong>: Frank is giving a lurid lesson on
the proper way to pump the keg to two ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN. Tom joins
him.</p>
<p>****: - - .Err- r - - - - ab a. ter. s</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You know you’re under surveillance here. He
gestures to Sheila, Frank’s wife, who’s about ten feet away, keeping an
angry eye on him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What can I do? Nature commands me to spread
my seed. I hear and obey.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure, great, just don’t be surprised if some
day Sheila digs out your 38 and buries a slug or two in your ass.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Please. The woman can’t even step on a
spider.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Spider doesn’t fuck around on her.</p>
<p><strong>a short distance away,</strong>: Sheila is talking to Maggie,
disgusted with Frank.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: They change, Maggie. Ten or so years of
marriage, a kid or two – they become a different human being.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Sheila, if you’re so miserable, why don’t
you leave? Adam’s almost out of school, he can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Oh, Frank would love that. No. I want him
out. I like that house.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: How long have you guys been there?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Almost fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So… you know most of the people around here
pretty well, right?</p>
<p><strong>in front of bernie’s tap,</strong>: somebody actually manages
to catch one of the passes coming from out of the bar and is immediately
tackled by three drunks. On the pavement. Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>in the crowd,</strong>: Tom is now talking to Harry
Damon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But, you know, what am I gonna do, I’m a
single father with a son to support, I can’ t just say fuck everything.
So I scraped together enough money to make a few downpayments, and here
I am. A landlord, for Christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So you’ve been in this neighborhood a long
time, right?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: is questioning Sheila.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Did you ever hear of a girl named Samantha
Muller?</p>
<p>****: From over by Baldwin?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: Yeah, kinda, name rings a bell.</p>
<p><strong>harry damon,</strong>: in response to the same question from
Tom, calls over to his son Kurt, the good-looking football player, who
is leaning against the front of his yellow Trans-Am, talking to a couple
other guys.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, Kurt, you remember that Muller girl?
Like he ever tells me anything.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The music coming from the car is too
loud, Kurt can’t hear. HARRY</p>
<p><strong>do you remember the – come over here !</strong>: He gestures.
Kurt drags himself off the hood and saunters over. HARRY Do you remember
that Muller girl?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: What, Dorothy? He makes a “big breasts”
gesture.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, the other one. Samantha. Lenny, the
crank, joins the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: You mean the retard? She ran away.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: is on the same subject.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: She was always hanging around the guys, you
know, she wanted to be with the “in” clique and everything. There wasn’t
much chance of that.</p>
<p><strong>harry damon,</strong>: asks Tom a question.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why you wanna know about her?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, Dorothy baby-sits for us sometimes and she
started talking about her sister, wonderin’ how she was doing and stuff.
I promised her I’d ask around, see if anybody’d heard anything from
her.</p>
<p>****: - - - Ambb. - - - - - Nft - &amp; a r-</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: She took off back in March, I think, with
some black guy.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: id she ever live in that house we’re .n? Frank
comes up, one arm around his son Adam.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. You’re the first tenants since I bought
it.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: Harry, I saw those Dominicans back in the
park again. By the basketball courts?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you want me to do about it,
Lenny?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: We could go talk to <code>em. Scare</code>em
off, if there were enough of us.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, Lenny, they’re gonna be terrified of
you.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: keeps talking to Maggie.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: She was a pretty girl, but real shy. Pretty
simple. She had these crazy ideas she could be an actress, you know. She
thought she was gonna be a big movie star. I mean, there was no way, but
you couldn’t tell her that. I thought it was kind of sad.</p>
<p><strong>frank and adam</strong>: have joined Tom and the others.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two one one.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two hundred eleven.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I give up, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two hundred and eleven yards rushing the
other night. That makes eight ninety-four with two games to play, kid
needs a hundred and six, that’s only fifty-three a game. He could walk
through the rest of the season and hit a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Dad… Behind them, the guys playing football
out of Bernie’s Tap have now organized a full-fledged game of tackle in
the street, over the objections of their wives and girlfriends, who
shout at them to stop.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I embarrass him. Are there worse things that
can happen to a human being?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey, Adam, way to go, man.</p>
<p>****: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Well, if you hear anything about her, lemme
know, okay?</p>
<p><strong>fraz. x</strong>: About who?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tom’s askin’ about that Muller girl from over
by Baldwin, you know, the one that ran away?</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: The retard.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Jesus, Lenny, don’t use that word.</p>
<p><strong>lenny</strong>: What, retard?</p>
<p>****: No, “the.”</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She was almost your age, Adam. You know
anything about her? Adam doesn’t answer right away. They all look at
him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Huh uh. Suddenly, the guys playing football
run a play right through the middle of them – sweaty, middle-aged bodies
fly in every direction. Everybody SHOUTS and lunges backward, protecting
their beers. The conversation is broken up. But the football players are
upset, and a fight breaks out. The crowd gets out of the way, half to
watch the fight with glee, the other half to shake their heads and watch
the fight.</p>
<p><strong>over at kurt’s car,</strong>: while the fight goes on in the
background, Adam wanders away from the group and sits down on the hood
of Kurt Damon’s car. He’s rattled. Kurt notices him and comes over. He
sits next to him.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: You don’t look fine.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Really, Mom? How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: All right, all right. Just, if there’s, you
know, if there’s somethin’ you wanna bullshit about or anything, just
let me know. Might help.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You could climb off my back, that’d help. Adam
walks away.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>at the end of the block,</strong>: two police cars arrive,
their lights flashing. COPS jump out and wade through the crowd to bust
up the fight. So much for the party. Sheila shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>sheila</strong>: It can’t ever just be nice. Someone’s always
got to ruin it.</p>
<p><strong>ext rooftop night</strong>: Nighttime. The city lights are
on. The sound of SOBBING rises faintly over them. We’re on the roof of a
house, and a figure with its back to us is doing the crying. The figure
drinks from a bottle. A long, hard pull.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Coming around thefrontwe see the figure
is Adam McCarthy, Frank and Sheila’sson,sitting on the roof of his
house, staring out at thecityand getting quietly shit-faced.</p>
<p><strong>int be. room day</strong>: Tom pries his eyes open,
exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window, right into his face. He
squints, looks at the clock. It’s 10:26.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, man… He sits up, painfully. A beam of
sunlight cuts him right across the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>a minute later,</strong>: Tom pulls his jeans on. He sits on
a chair, puts on a shoe. But the other one’s gone. He feels under the
chair. Not there. He opens the closet door. Not there. He looks under
the bed. There it is. He grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>int bathroom day</strong>: A note is taped to the bathroom
mirror – “WENT TO THE PARK</p>
<p><strong>with jake. m.”</strong>: Tom takes it down and reads it.</p>
<p><strong>int living room day</strong>: Tom comes downstairs and heads
for the kitchen. There’s someone standing in his living room, in the
doorway from the dining room. It’s Frank, his neighbor from next door,
wearing a red shirt. Frank is staring at the floor.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Frank? What are you doing here? Frank looks up
at him. His face is sad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They’re going to kill you, Tommy. You and
Maggie both.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Frank turns and walks to the front door.
He opens it, walks outside, and sits on the top step of the porch,
looking out at the street. Tom follows him.</p>
<p><strong>ext front porch day</strong>: It’s a beautiful day, but the
street is still kind of a m..ss from the party yesterday. Tom comes out
and looks down at Frank, who’s just sitting there, staring out at the
litter.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why did you say that, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is a decent neighborhood. On the street,
TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each other, full tilt, SCREAMING.
At the last second, one of the kids swerves, the other taunts him with
cries of “Chicken!” A bird swoops over Tom’s head, too low, and Tom
flinches. He walks across the driveway, toward Frank’s house. The
MAILMAN waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back. Tom walks
up the steps to Frank’s front door and knocks. A VOICE calls from
inside. ADAM Come in!</p>
<p><strong>int frank’s house day</strong>: Tom opens the door and comes
in. Adam, Frank’s son, is standing in the middle of the living room
floor, a big smile on his face and one arm behind his back.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Want to see what I’ve got?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Sure. Adam pulls his arm around from behind his
back. He’s holding a 38 with a carved white handle.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM Is that your dad’s?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not today. Come here: Tom walks toward him.
ADAM Closer. Tom walks closer. He’s right in front of Adam. ADAM I bet
you never saw this before. He points the gun barrel at Tom – – then
swings it around and points it at his own heart.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, don’t do that. Adam pulls the trigger. Tom
SCREAMS as Adam collapses to the floor, blood pouring from his chest.
His body convulses –</p>
<p><strong>int bedroom day</strong>: – and Tom’s eyes pop open, in bed.
That was weird. Tom blinks, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the
window, right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It’s</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, man… He sits up, painfully. A beam of
sunlight cuts him right across the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>a minute later,</strong>: Tom pulls on a pair of jeans. He
sits down, puts on a shoe. But the other one’s gone. He feels under the
chair. Not there. He opens the closet door. Not there. Tom blinks,
unsettled. This is kinda familiar. He turns and looks at the bed.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Please don’t be under there. He bends down,
lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed. There’s his shoe. TOM Shit.
He grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>int bathroom day</strong>: A note is taped to the bathroom
mirror – “WENT TO THE PARK</p>
<p><strong>with jake. m.”</strong>: Tom winces as he takes it down and
reads it. Again.</p>
<p><strong>int living room day</strong>: Shod, Tom comes down the stairs
and into the living room. Frank’s not there, thank God. Tom goes to the
front door and opens it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Uh… Frank? But Frank’s not on the porch either.
Tom steps outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext front porch day</strong>: It’s a beautiful day, but the
street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws
Tom’s attention. Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other,
full tilt. Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as
they SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The other
taunts him with cries of “Chicken!” Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A
bird swoops low over his head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman
waves to him, headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn’t wave back.
He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank’s house. He starts to walk toward
it, slowly at first, then picking up speed, jogging across the driveway.
He’s halfway there – – when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He races the rest of the way, bounds up
the steps to the house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is
locked. He POUNDS on it. TOM</p>
<p><strong>adam?! adam, open the door!!</strong>: He POUNDS harder, but
there’s no answer. He goes to the window beside the door and peers
through it.</p>
<p><strong>through the window,</strong>: he sees Adam lying on the floor
in the middle of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, God, no! Tom picks up a porch chair and
heaves it through the window.</p>
<p><strong>int frank’s house day</strong>: Glass SHATTERS and sprays all
over the floor. Tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and
climbs into the house. He races over to Adam’s body. There is a pool of
blood around his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he
clutches a 38 with a carved white handle.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please… He grabs a
blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam’s chest, trying to stop
the bleeding. TOM This is really happening.., it’s really happening…</p>
<p><strong>ext our block day</strong>: Tom sits on his front steps,
shell shocked, red light flashing off his face. An ambulance and two
police cars are parked in front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING
with official activity.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Tom just stares. A car comes barreling
around the corner and SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and
Sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house. Tom watches as
they’re intercepted-by a COP who tries to restrain them for a second.
But they’re hysterical, they’ve obviously been told something serious
has happened and they’re desperate to get inside. They blow past the Cop
and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out
of the house, headed for the ambulance. The sheet isn’t over Adam’s
head, at least, but that’s about the only good sign, they’re working on
him frantically. Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of
Adam’s parents – Frank’s anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila’s
horrified SCREAM.</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: CLOSE ON a torn off piece of
notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it. The word
“Cacophony” is legible. Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment,
then hands it to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He
takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He’s nervous. They both are. She
smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she tightens her grip on his
jacket. Doesn’t want to let him go.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We need some answers, right? Maybe they’re the
only ones who have any. She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up
her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the
ring.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m sure they’re very nice people, but in
case they aren’t – She hands a thin black cannister to him. MAGGIE Mace
the shit out of `em. He smiles and shoves it in his pocket. She kisses
him.</p>
<p><strong>ext dingy street night</strong>: Tom walks down a street in a
dodgy neighborhood at night, checking addresses. He stops and looks up,
at an old, formerly grand apartment building that’s fallen on hard
times.</p>
<p><strong>int building - corridor night</strong>: The corridor is even
creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a door all the way at the end and
knocks. A moment later, the door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a
floral print dress smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: I hope you like fondue!</p>
<p><strong>int vivian’s apartment night</strong>: Vivian sets a plate
down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There is a pile of chunks of various
hard-to-identify meats, a silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake
with an American flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch
that’s leaking stuffing.</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Dip away!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thank you. Listen, is, uh – Vivian gives
another plate to a man sitting next to Tom, HERMAN, in his seventies, in
a wheelchair, an oxygen tube running into his nostrils. TOM Is there a
guy named Neil here? He’s a cop?</p>
<p><strong>vivian</strong>: Well, of course he is! She turns and heads
back into the kitchen, passing BEVERLY, her identical twin, who’s
wearing the same print dress, this one with a red background instead of
blue. Beverly serves two people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR
OLD GIRL, the other a HOMEY in his early twenties. Tom picks up a ham
chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot, full of cheese. Beverly dips
and eats, winks at him, and flits off across the room. Herman turns to
Tom and asks something in a raspy voice.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Excuse me? Irritated, Herman gestures for him
to lean closer. Tom does.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: What does it want you to do?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I don’t… I’m sorry, I don’t under- Herman wraps
his bony fingers around Tom’s wrist.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Then you’re not listening! NEIL It’s his
first time, Herman. Give him a break. Tom turns. Neil, the cop he saw
the other night, has come in from the kitchen. Tonight he’s in street
clothes. NEIL Lemme guess. “Distended parietal lobe,” right?</p>
<p>****: Who are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t have a name. Cacophony Society, somebody
said once, that stuck for a while. You know, like too many voices in our
heads? I think it’s too melodramatic. How about “fellow sufferers?”
Vivian comes in from the kitchen with two big gallon jugs of orange
juice. There are AAAAHS1 of appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Does everybody here – see things, like me?</p>
<p>****: Buncha freaks, huh?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Speak for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No, Herman, you’re a freak. “Mutants” is a
better word for the rest of us. He pulls ‘ip a chair and sits down
opposite Tom. On the other side of tie room, Vivian and Beverly tell an
animated two-part story to he teenage girl and the homey, finishing each
others’ se. .tences . NEIL Like any other part of our body, our brains
have evolved a lot in a hundred thousand years. Our first thoughts were
formless. Struggling consciousness. Sensation. An instinctive tie to our
environment. But then our brains began to focus. We sacrificed the
intuitions we first had so our thoughts could be directed, so we could
master specific functions. That’s where we are at the moment. We’re
brilliant with technique, but we’ve given up instinct. So the next
evolutionary step, the step yet to come, or perhaps it’s already in the
making, is actually backward. To maintain our higher functions, but
reawaken the part of our brain that was pure intuition. That was
receptive to anything, because it didn’t know enough not to believe.
You’re a freak of nature, pal, an evolutionary step. You’re double-
jointed. Up here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Are we the only ones?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hardly. I’ve heard of groups like ours in San
Francisco, New York, Minneapolis – those are just the cities I’ve been
to. Tom, you’re what they used to call a medium. You’re like a man in a
dark tunnel with a flashlight, but the light only goes on once in a
while. When it flickers on, you get a glimpse of something, but not
enough of a glimpse to know what it is. Just enough to know it’s
there.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What about my son?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The ncxt generation. Much better
flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Wright, if there’s all these people who got
this power, why doesn’t everybody know about it? Why isn’t it common
knowledge?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It is. A lotta people know. Unfortunately, the
easiest people to convince, the believer types, they also tend to be the
dumbest. And people who demand proof – well, this isn’t something we can
control, it comes when it comes, so if you can’t make it happen, how can
you prove it? It’s like that singing frog in the cartoon, but when the
guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk. Herman
laughs, horribly. He likes that cartoon. NEIL Some of us try anyway. I
say who needs that kind of aggravation?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This all started when I was hypnotized. Is that
how it always is?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: First time I’ve heard that one. it comes all
different ways. Sometimes it goes the same way it came.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So it does go away.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: For some people. Don’t look for rules. We’re
off the map here.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: What does it want you to do?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What does what want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: You saw a ghos-, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>z ’m</strong>: Yeah. Twice. t. girl that disappeared from my
neighborhood. Now the kid next door just tried to kill himself. I think
he knew something, but now I’ll never know what it was. And I gotta
know.</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Look, what’d the bitch want?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why do you assume she wants something?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: They always do. Something they need finished,
something they can’t do any more.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Because she’s confused. Doesn’t know why other
people won’t answer her. She only knows that you will. If she hasn’t
asked for something yet, she will. And once they ask, it’s very
difficult to stop yourself from doing it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What do you mean? She can, it can make me do
something I don’t want to do?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Oh, no. You’ll want to. Badly. You won’t think
about anything else. You won’t sleep. You won’t eat. You’ll lie. And God
help anyone who tries to stop you.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What if I stop me? What if I just don’t do
it?</p>
<p><strong>herman</strong>: Then you got a weird bitch friend for the
rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Just listen to her, Tom Let her tell you what
she wants.</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment - hallway night</strong>: A HAND
pounds on an apartment door. Philip opens up. He was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What, what, what?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I want you to hypnotize me again.</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment night</strong>: Tom paces the floor in
Philip’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Just slow down, you gotta be a little
patient with me here, `cause, um… well, Tom, Tom, I’ve got a confession
to make. See I, I, I just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes
before you walked in, so this shit you’re tellin’ me here is fuckin’
with my mind just a little bit extra, okay? Tom grabs a chair from
Philip’s desk and sits.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>moments later,</strong>: they sit face to face.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Okay. Close your eyes. Tom closes his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>in the black,</strong>: PHILIP Just like last time – I want
you to concentrate. Listen to the room around you. Tom listens. The
factory CHURNS softly outsioi the windows. A few CARS in the street
below. His BREATHING. PHILIP Now focus. Concentrate. Look at the backs
of your eyelids. Do you see anything there?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Would you just get to it, please?</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: All right, all right. Tom closes his eyes
again. PHILIP I want you to pretend you’re in a movie theatre.</p>
<p><strong>int movie theatre night</strong>: We’re sitting alone in an
empty movie theatre. The seats and walls are covered in black velvet.
PHILIP It’s very dark. Everything is covered in black velvet. The seats,
the walls, the floor. In the whole pitch- black theatre, there’s only
one thing you can see. The white screen. You drift toward it, in your
chair. Up ahead of us, the screen is a dazzling white. We move slowly
toward it, floating over the seats. PHILIP There are letters up on the
screen. Tall, thick, black letters, but they’re out of focus. You drift
closer to them.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: We do drift closer to the blurry
letters, but our attention is diverted by something. Three rows from the
screen, there is a figure in one of the seats, its back to us.</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment night</strong>: Tom’s eyes are sill
closed. His face furrows in conctrn.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: There’s someone in here.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No, it’s empty.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: There’s someone else here.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: No, man, I said you’re alone in the
theatre.</p>
<p><strong>int movie theatre night</strong>: But there is someone in the
theatre with us, and we continue to drift forward toward them. PHILIP
You’re comfortable in your black velvet seat, very comfortable…
Actually, we’re quite nervous, drifting closer and closer to that figure
sitting in the third row, its back to us. PHILIP Your feet and ankles
are relaxed. Your legs are relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment night</strong>: Tom’s eyes are still
closed. His chest is twitching.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: hard to breathe</p>
<p><strong>int movie theatre night</strong>: The figure in the seat is
only a row or two ahead of us now. It’s a woman. We keep drifting
closer. PHILIP Your hands are limp and heavy. Your arms are relaxed.
Your face.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Our hand reaches out, touches the
shoulder of the woman. She turns. It’s Samantha. Her face is shrouded in
plastic. Her mouth presses against the plastic, it forms a horrible
round 0, contorted in a silent scream.</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment night</strong>: Tom’s eyes flicker
madly under the lids. Philip’s worried.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I want you to look at the screen.</p>
<p>****: I can’t breathe!</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Look at the screen, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>int movie theatre night</strong>: Now Tom’s not just an
observer in the movie theatre, he’s in the movie theatre, sitting right
next to Samantha. She’s pawing at him, it’s all he can do to fight her
hands off. In their struggle, his fingers close around the plastic that
shrouds her face. He sweeps it off her head. PHILIP The screen, Tom,
look at the screen! You can read the letters now! Samantha’s face is
bloodied and bruised, as the plastic comes off she GASPS for air and
lets out a ghastly, inhuman SHRIEK that fills the theatre. Philip’s
voice gets louder as he struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis.
PHILIP Look at the screen, Tom, you’re close enough now, you can read
the letters, you’re right up next to them! Tom, still holding off
Samantha’s grasping hands, turns and looks up at the movie screen.
PHILIP The letters come into focus, they spell – Tom’s eyes widen as he
stares at the screen. Three huge letters pop into focus and fill our
field of vision. The letters say:</p>
<p><strong>int philip’s apartment night</strong>: Tom’s eyes pop open
and he staggers backwards, gasping for air, knocking the chair out from
under himself. He falls back against Philip’s desk, scared out of his
mind.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: What?! What happened?!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Couldn’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Are you okay?! Tom wipes his brow, he’s
covered in sweat.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Plastic, like sheets of plastic… He shoves
Philip out of the way, finds the refrigerator on the other side of the
room. He rips it open, searches for something to drink. Philip follows
him.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I think you need to sit down, man, something
very next level was happening there, you should have seen your face.
Only beer in the fridge. Tom CRACKS one open and upends it. PHILIP Uh…
want a brew? Tom drinks the entire can. PHILIP Feel better? Tom nods,
wiping his chin. PHILIP What happened? Tom looks at him, calming.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: She told me what she wants.</p>
<p><strong>ext tom &amp; maggie’s house day</strong>: Maggie’s Sentra
pulls into the driveway of their house, parking behind Tom’s phone
company truck. She gets out, dressed in work clothes, and pulls two bags
of groceries out of the trunk. She looks at Tom’s truck, then at her
watch. Home already?</p>
<p><strong>int tom &amp; maggie’s house day</strong>: Maggie comes in
the front door.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hey! You’re home early! She struggles to
take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries. MAGGIE
Can you pick up Jake? I’m exhausted! She comes in and kicks the door
shut behind her. Tom’s nowhere to be seen. From somewhere in back, there
is a faint CRUNCHING sound. MAGGIE Hello? No answer. She heads into the
kitchen with the groceries.</p>
<p><strong>int kitchen day</strong>: In the kitchen, a letter is waiting
in the tray of an old fax machine on the counter. Maggie stops in the
doorway, staring at the floor. Muddy footprints lead into and out of the
kitchen, through the door to the back. Thick chunks of wet mud are
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hey, look what I’m not cleaning up. She sets
the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk. She
opens the refrigerator. She does a double take. The entire top shelf is
jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice. From outside, the
CRUNCHING sound comes again. She follows the muddy footprints out the
kitchen door.</p>
<p><strong>ext back yard day</strong>: The back yard is smallish, but
it’s a nice little patch of grass. Used to be, anyway, because now there
are three large holes in it, dug seemingly at random locations. Large
piles of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes. Tom stands in
one of t1.e holes, his back to Maggie, hoisting a large pick axe high
over his head. CRUNCH. He brings the pick down, into the hole. Busy guy.
Maggie is aghast. She walks slowly across the yard, past a pile of
shovels and buckets and other tools. She draws closer to him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Tom? Tom raises the pick high and brings it
down hard. CRUNCH. The hole he’s in at the moment isn’t more than two or
three feet deep. But, hey, it’s early. Maggie draws closer. In between
swings – MAGGIE Tom. Tom whirls, the pick raised to defend himself. His
shirt’s off, his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat. Maggie
jumps back.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You scared me. And with that, he turns back to
the job. Swing. CRUNCH.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: S scared you? Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE Tom.
Swing. CRUNCH. MAGGIE What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m supposed to dig.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Swing. CRUNCH. Maggie walks around him,
so she’s facing him. He keeps working.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What do you mean? Zom shrugs. Swings the
pick.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m supposed to dig.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Who says? He just looks at her from under
his sweaty brows. You know who. MAGGIE Oh. Tom manages to break apart
the rock he was working on with the pick. He tosses the axe, which
bounces crazily across the grass at Maggie’s feet. She jumps out of the
way. He hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose. He
sprays water into the hole. MAGGIE Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Water softens up the dirt. He tosses the hose
aside and grabs a shovel. He jumps back in the hole and starts to
dig.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, I mean… Could you stop for a minute?
Would you please stop for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What don’ t you get? I’m supposed to dig.</p>
<p><strong>minute!</strong>: He looks up, supremely irritated, and leans
on the shovel. “Well?”</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: MAGGIE M2y are you digging?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: , I’m searching.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What are you searching for?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: The question isn’t “what.” We both know very
well “what,” even if we don’t want to may it out loud. The question,
Maggie, which, as you can plainly see, I am very busy trying to answer –
the question is “Where?”</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I think we should call the police.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And tell them what, exactly? Run it by me once.
Practice, see how it sounds. Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Why don’t you come in the house with me?
Take a break. I want to talk to you, you’re not yourself right now.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: This is just fucking typical, isn’t it? He
climbs out of the hole and walks toward her. TOM What do you want me to
do, Maggie, you want me to go inside, sit down in front of the TV, drink
eight or nine beers till I fall asleep in the chair? Like that? Maybe
repeat the whole thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after and
the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and
the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and
the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and
the day after-</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: -until I grab my chest-and die?! e I was
already dead! This is the mos. important thing that’s ever happ•ned to
me, the most important thins I’ve ever done in my life, Maggie, my whole
stupid life, and you want me to just STOP?! By the and of his tirade,
TWO NEIGHBORS are staring over the back fence. He’s only a few feet from
Maggie now, the veins in his neck standing out. She holds her
ground.</p>
<p>****: I’ve known you since I’m nineteen years old, you never talked
to me like that before. Not one time. He stares at her, furious – – and
then jumps in the hole and starts digging again. Maggie turns and stalks
across the yard and into the house. Tom keeps digging for a moment, then
hurls the shovel across the yard.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: InterRUPtions! He picks up his tee shirt,
snakes angrily into it, and marches across the yard toward the house.
TOM What are YOU lookin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>int kitchen day</strong>: Maggie site at the kitchen table,
reading the letter that came in on the fax. Tom comes into the room
behind her, pauses in the doorway, composing himself. She keeps reading.
He sighs, heavily. She doesn’t turn around. He goes to the refrigerator
and takes out a carton of orange juice. He takes two glasses from a
cupboard and sits down at the table opposite her. He fills both glasses
and puts one in front of her. She looks up at him as he drains his. He
pauses, staring at her.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You gonna drink that? She doesn’t answer. He
takes her glass, drinks some. TOM I’m sorry. No answer. TOM Okay, I’m
not sorry. She ignores him. He looks at the letter in her hands. TOM
Who’s that from?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: My brother Steve. My mother’s going back in
the hospital again.</p>
<p>****: No, sh- He stops himself. She looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What? He shakes his head. MAGGIE What?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Nothing. They stare at each other. Tom’s face
is pale. Maggie is concerned. The phone RINGS. Maggie stares at Tom. The
phone RINGS again. She lowers her voice, pleading.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What is it? Tom can’t look at her. The phone
RINGS again. Tom gets up, opens the door that leads to the back yard,
and goes outside.</p>
<p><strong>ext back yard day</strong>: Tom takes a few steps out of the
house, putting his hands to his head in pain. Whatever it is, he knows.
In the house, the phone rings a fourth time. Maggie’s voice drifts
through the open doorway as she answers i;.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hello? Tom closes his eyes. MAGGIE Steve, I
was just going to- She stops. There is a long silence. Tom opens his
eyes. A tear runs down his cheek. He wipes it away. He turns and walks
back toward the house, slowly. There is dead silence inside. As he nears
the doorway, he hears the sound of the telephone being placed back in
its cradle. Maggie reaches the doorway at the same time Tom does. She
looks up at him, her eyes filled with tears. He puts his arms around her
and she breaks down. He holds her. He holds her for a long moment.
MAGGIE You knew. You knew, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: When’s the funeral?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Sunday. We should leave as soon as we
can.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We? She stiffens. TOM Oh, you, uh… you want me
to go with you? She looks at him, deeply hurt. Then enraged. She pushes
him away from her, hard. He stumbles back into the yard.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM Hey, I just thought, maybe, you
know… your family might want…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Do I WANT you to come with me:! To my
MOTHER’S FUNERAL?! Of COURSE L want you to come, why the hell WOULLV’T
you come?! But he’s looking past her, at the holes in the yard.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’m just… kind of in the middle of something
here. She looks at him, absolutely incredulous – – and then storms back
into the house, SLAMMING the door so hard two of the glass panes
spiderweb.</p>
<p><strong>ext driveway day</strong>: Jake, twisted around in his car
seat, looks out the back window of Maggie’s car. He raises one hand,
waving. Tom stands in the open doorway of the garage, still in his mud-
stained jeans and tee shirt. He waves back. The car pulls out of the
driveway, fast, and ROARS off down the block. Jake and Maggie are
gone.</p>
<p><strong>ext back yard day</strong>: There are now five large holes in
the back yard, and Tom is running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he
drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far
corner. He stops short. Hose won’t reach.</p>
<p><strong>at the spigot,</strong>: he unscrews the hose and carries it
across the yard.</p>
<p><strong>at another spigot,</strong>: this one in the far corner, he
reconnects the hose and turns on the water. Nothing comes out.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come on! Tom curses and trudges back toward the
house.</p>
<p><strong>int kitchen day</strong>: Tom gets a screwdriver from a tool
drawer in the kit-hen.</p>
<p><strong>int dining room day</strong>: Tom stomps into the dining room
and goes to a closet on the far wall. He opens the door and tosses aside
a carpet flap that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a
crack in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the
middle of the closet floor. Through the hole, he can see a ladder
resting up against the wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet
and starts to climb down.</p>
<p><strong>int basement day</strong>: As Tom climbs down, he reaches out
for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on.
They have only a partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight
feet deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl space,
barely enough to wriggle through. Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the
far side, where a mess of water pipes all converge. He picks through
them, finds the valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one
on. WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot. He
turns to climb back up the ladder. And stops. He looks down, at the
floor. It’s dirt. He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking.</p>
<p><strong>a few minutes later,</strong>: the pick axe falls. Tom has
brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle
of the basement floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on
the earthen walls. He works.</p>
<p><strong>ext our block day</strong>: It’s quiet in the neighborhood.
The CRUNCHING sound of Tom’s pick axe falling echoes over the block.</p>
<p><strong>int basement day</strong>: Tom digs. The hole is almost four
feet across, five feet deep. He’s uncovered a large rock, a major chunk
of stone, right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He’s excavated
all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a
pry bar, but it won’t budge. Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning
against the pile of mud and stone he’s already hauled out. He
thinks.</p>
<p><strong>int yard supply warehouse day</strong>: Tom walks down an
aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse. Tools are mounted
on the wall for sale – shovels, picks, post hole diggers. Got all that.
Tom keeps walking. The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades.
Hand pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking. At the end
of the row, underneath a sign that says “FOR RENTAL ONLY” is an
industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews use to bust through
whatever’s in their way. Tom’s face lights up.</p>
<p><strong>ext street day</strong>: The jackhammer rides in the back of
Tom’s pickup truck, rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes.
Tom pulls into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate. Using all
his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck.
It’s incredibly heavy, it takes all his strength to haul it up the
stairs, kick open his door, and bring it into the house.</p>
<p><strong>in the street,</strong>: Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is
washing his car. He hears a CRASH from over at Tom’s place and turns. He
sees Tom at his pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it. Tom
fights his way into the house with the compressor. Lenny stares at
him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Sheila, carrying flowers and looking
like didn’t sleep last night, comes out of her house and heads for her
car. She stops and stares too.</p>
<p><strong>int basement day</strong>: In Tom’s basement, the compressor
descends through the trap door above, seemingly of its own accord – than
we see it’s at the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space,
sweating and straining, lowering the thing down. It settles on the floor
next to the jackhammer.</p>
<p><strong>a bit later,</strong>: Tom reaches up to the hanging light
bulb, which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a
yellow safety cord. He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES
to life. He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the
jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power. Tom picks up the
jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock that’s been in his way. He
positions the jackhammer’s spike on the top of the rock. He lowers a
pair of goggles over his eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the
jackhammer, and squeezes the handles. The jackhammer ROARS to life. It’s
deafening. Tom’s whole body quivers. It’s like riding a bull, but the
rock begins to split in half. Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the
din that echoes in his basement.</p>
<p><strong>ext street dusk</strong>: As the sun goes down, the sound of
the ROARING jackhammer is plainly audible on the block. The familiar
Homeless Guy stops and SHOUTS something at Tom’s house. Across the
street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and stares at Tom’s house.
What the hell is that guy up to?</p>
<p><strong>int uncle steve’s house night</strong>: A group of PEOPLE IN
DARK CLOTHES mill around a living room, muttering in the soft tones of
those at a wake.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: There’s a lot of big Irish guys drinking
beer, guts stuffed into sweat-stained white shirts. Maggie excuses
herself from the group and steps into another room.</p>
<p><strong>int steve’s bedroom night</strong>: The door is ajar, people
visible through it as Maggie dials a nu-rber on a bedside telephone. The
phone rings on the other enc. And rings. And rings. Just as she’s about
to hang up, Tom answers. TOM Hello?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: It’s me. TOM Oh, hi. How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m okay. TOM How’s your family?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You know. Drunk. Fighting with each other.
TOM Listen, Maggie, I’m sorry. I was an asshole. I should be there with
you right now.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, well, what can I say? You are kind of
an asshole. How do you feel? TOM Fine. A lot better. Much, much better.
Everything’s fine here. Real good.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Have you had any- TOM Nope. Not even
one.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: No, uh… no more digging?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TOM No. Uh uh. Back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Look, I’m sorry too. I’ wish I hadn’t just
stormed out of there, I shouldn’t have left you alone. TOM I deserved
it.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Are you okay? You sound funny. What are you
doing? TOM Just… moving a chair. There.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Why don’t you come up here with us? This
time of night you could make it in an hour. TOM Well, I can’t,
really.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Why not? TOM I’m, uh, not supposed to use
the truck for personal trips.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Alright. I’ll come down there and get you.
I’ll leave right now. Behind her, the bedroom door swings open. Jake
stands there. He looks terrible. She doesn’t hear him come in. TOM No,
no, no, no, no, what do you want to do that for? Don’t come down
here.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Feathers everywhere. Maggie turns back to Jake
– and GASPS. He’s peeing his pants, the urine drizzling down over his
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Oh, my God, I gotta go. I’ll be there in an
hour. TOM Maggie, wait, no, Mag- She hangs up the phone and races over
to her son.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Honey, what happened? Why didn’t you tell me
you had to go to the potty? Jake turns and looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Help Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>int tom &amp; maggie’s dining room night</strong>: Tom SLAMS
down the phone. He’s standing in the dining room, which is now so
mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a cave. The table has been
shoved against the wall, legs sticking out into the room. One corner is
filled with a pile of broken-up chunks of rock. Tom strides across the
room in two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open
trap door.</p>
<p><strong>int basement night</strong>: Tom sails down into the basement
and lands nimbly on the floor. Doesn’t even use the ladder anymore. The
rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole is now eight
feet long and as many wide, and about four feet deep. Tom leaps down
into it and goes back to work.</p>
<p><strong>int steve’s house night</strong>: In the front hall of the
house, Maggie is putting on her coat. Jake sits on the steps, his coat
on the carpet next to him.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Jake, come on, we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m staying here.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I want to stay at Uncle Steve’s, I don’t want
to go home.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Because I’m not safe there. Because of the
feathers.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: What does that mean, Jake? He shrugs.
Philip, Maggie’s brother, stands in the doorway to the other room.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: It’s okay, I can watch him. Maggie, in a
hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Be good. She opens the door and heads out.
As it’s swinging shut:</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t stop for the train, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>ext uncle steve’s house night</strong>: Maggie hears that
just as the door closes behind her. She misses a step, thinking about
it, then starts walking to her car. She walks faster. Then she runs.</p>
<p><strong>int basement night</strong>: In the basement, Tom abruptly
stops digging, staring at the dirt. The corner of something shiny is
sticking out from the pile. He bends down and pulls it out.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s a piece of clear blue plastic
sheeting, about two inches square. Tom’s hand starts to shake as he
holds it.</p>
<p><strong>an image</strong>: flas.es through his mind again, the one
he’s seen twice befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through
that blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses.</p>
<p><strong>in the basement,</strong>: Tom turns and leaps into the hole,
shovel in hand. He begins to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all
directions. At one end of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling
off it as it sticks on something. Something buried. Tom drops the
shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away
from whatever it was. More blue plastic. Tom tugs out about eight inches
of the plastic, gets a good grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up.
Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue plastic rises
up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit. Breathing
hard, Tom grabs the shovel again.</p>
<p><strong>the dirt,</strong>: flies away from the plastic as Tom works
furiously.</p>
<p><strong>tom’s face</strong>: is of a man possessed. He digs as fast
as he can.</p>
<p><strong>finally,</strong>: Tom stands back, staring down at what he
has unearthed. Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue
plastic, wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and
two and a half feet wide. Tom bends down and lays one hand on the
plastic. He flinches.</p>
<p><strong>an image</strong>: pops into his mind, another familiar one.
A FIGURE IN Afl OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom’s own house
in winter, waving to us to come up.</p>
<p><strong>in the basement,</strong>: Tom jerks his hand off the
plastic. He swallows. He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility
knife. He slides the ra or blade forward. He goes to one and of the
plastic, bends down, and jams the knife through the sheeting. He walks
the length of it, making a slit down the middle. He reaches out with
shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back. The first thing he
sees is a partially decomposed human hand. Around the withered wrist,
there are a half dozen multi- colored bracelets. Tom yanks the rest of
the plastic away, revealing the half- decomposed body of Samantha
Muller, still in the black dress with the diamond pattern. Tom stands
there, his chest heaving. He looks at her hand, thinking. He sits down
next to her. He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back. Can’t
do it. But he’s gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He
slides his hand underneath – takes a deep breath – – and closes his
living fingers around her skeletal ones. He GASPS. His face turns a
horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue, and STEAM comes out of his
mouth, the way it did hers when he first saw her in his living room.</p>
<p><strong>ext tom’s house day</strong>: It’s a wintry day. That same
steam rises up in front of us, coming from our own mouth. We’re looking
at the front porch of Tom’s house as we walk past it. The house is being
remodeled, it’s surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered with
plastic Duvateen. The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: C’mare a sec!</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>figure</strong>: I want to show you something! We look back,
over our shoulder, then back at the Figure. You mean me? This close now,
we see the Figure is Kurt Damon.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: You want to show me something? Her manner
of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler’s.</p>
<p>****: Well, of course! I don’t see anybody else around! We start up
the steps of the porch. Kurt smiles, beguilingly, and holds a hand out
to us.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: It’s a surprise. He tugs. She resists.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: What kind of surprise?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Well, if I told you, it wouldn’t be much of a
surprise, would it? We let him pull us through the door.</p>
<p><strong>int house day</strong>: Kurt leads us into the living room.
The windows are covered with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light
through the place. Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking
from a bottle of schnapps. He’s drunk, slurring. He sees us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Happy St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: What’s the surprise?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh… don’t you have it? He giggles.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Oh yeah, the surprise.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The surprise. They laugh and look at each
other. Kurt drinks, then forces the bottle back at Adam. ADAM I’m too
wasted.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Drink, motherfucker, drink motherfucker, drink
motherfucker</p>
<p><strong>drink!</strong>: He wrestles with Adam, forcing him to drink.
Half of it runs down Adam’s chin.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: I don’t think there is a surprise. We turn
and start for the door. Kurt hurries around, intercepts us.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Yeah there is, yeah there is. He puts his arm
around us, leads us back into the room.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: KURT The surprise is… we decided we want
to be your friends.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, yeah, so bad. He laughs.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Why do you want to be my friend?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Are you kidding? Look at yourself! Kurt turns
Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the fireplace. She’s
good-looking, if she knew it. Terribly insecure, doesn’t even like
looking at herself. We turn away, embarrassed. KURT Ah ah ah, look! He
makes us look in the mirror again. KURT Mama, you are hot. He turns her
toward him, looks at her, closely. KURT</p>
<p>****: Come on, let’s be friends.</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: Well.., you can kiss me if you want to.
Kurt leans in close, kisses us. After a moment, we force our head away,
looking down. Kurt’s hand is on Samantha’s breast. We push him back.
SAMANTHA Not like that! But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly. We
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Come on, Samantha, I’ll be your friend, I
swear I will.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: KURT Just be nice to me. Be a good girl.
You’re a good girl, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>samantha</strong>: I have to go home. We struggle some more.
He gets his powerful hanis on our shoulders and starts to push us
down.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Come on, baby, how `bout a little helmet wash?
His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We tear away,
get up and run for the door. From behind, something hits us very hard.
The floorboards race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard,
bounce off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood. Our head
lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy, vomiting in the
corner. Abruptly, we’re rolled over and are staring at the ceiling. Kurt
Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands rise up, try to
push him off, but he’s stronger. Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close
over our face. She bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS
again. KURT</p>
<p><strong>shut up! shut up!</strong>: Kurt holds her down, begins to
try to undress her. She writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into
Kurt’s hair and pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain. In the
corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears.</p>
<p><strong>screamin’, man, make her stop!</strong>: But she keeps
screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that’s sitting on the fireplace
mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG comes on, loud. It’s a haunting tune,
we recognize it. St’s the song Jake has been humming. Kurt continues his
fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing her hand out of his
hair.</p>
<p><strong>something’</strong>: Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a
sheet of the blts plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet –
– and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye muffled and
distorted through the blue plastic. We see the image that has haunted
Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue demon as he grapples on top of
us.</p>
<p><strong>in tom’s basement,</strong>: Tom is sprawled out beside the
corpse, their hands locked together. His color is cadaverous. He’s
suffocating. He thrashes.</p>
<p><strong>in the house,</strong>: back in Samantha’s point of view, we
struggle, we thrash, it seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds
become fainter and fainter and fainter… and everything stops. We hear
the muffled voices of Kurt and Adam SCREAMING at each other. The sheet
is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam stand above us,
chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces, looking at us like we’re
a dog they just killed with their car.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: What the fuck did you do that for?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: No shit she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Look at her tongue, man.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not here.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: I never saw nobody dead before. We start to
fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor. Kurt and Adam grow
taller, further away. Their voices fade.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I wish I wasn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: It’s fuckin’ gross.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Fuckin’ plastic over her face. Good thinkin’,
Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do we do now? Kurt and Adam are very far
away, blobs of light at the end of a black tunnel that’s closing in
around us. Just before everything goes completely black –</p>
<p><strong>int basement night</strong>: Tom’s fingers twitch open and
his hand pulls free of Samantha’s. He opens his eyes and gulps air. The
color returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers. But as he
does so, he stops, staring intently at something in her fingers. We
don’t see what it is. Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the
ladder that leads upstairs. As he goes, we pause, looking between two
rungs near the top of the ladder. In the darkened crawl space under the
rest of the house – – a pair of eyes stare at us. It’s Kurt Damon. He
twists around quickly and scoots back out under the house, the way he
came in.</p>
<p><strong>ext tom’s house night</strong>: Under the front porch, a wood
frame access panel lies on the grass next to the foundation of Tom’s
house, where it has been removed. Kurt Damon wriggles out from under the
house and comes onto the grass.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: But the sound of the front door of Tom’s
house opening sends him scurrying back into the shadows. TOM’S FEET come
down the steps and head off across the driveway. A moment later, Kurt
darts out from’his hiding place and hurries across the street, toward
his own house. “om, nearing the front steps of Frank’s house next door,
thought he heard something. He turns back, but Kurt is gone. Tom climbs
the steps to Frank’s house. Bouquets of flowers have been left here and
there on the steps, along with a few candles and handwritten signs
–”Hang in there, Adam,” “We Love You,” that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>on frank’s front porch,</strong>: Tom knocks on the front
door. A moment later, Frank opens it. He looks devastated,
shell-shocked, his eyes sunken from crying. He’s wearing a red shirt
we’ve seen before.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How’s he doin’? Frank shrugs. Can’t talk
much.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He might make it. Might not. Sheila’s over
there now, I’m headed back.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Frank, I’m sorry. I’m sorry because… I think I
know why Adam shot himself. And I have to call the police about it. But
I don’t want you to hear it from them, I don’t want Sheila to read it in
the paper. You have the right to know before anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Come with me. He nods toward his own house.
Frank stares at him, frightened, but what could possibly be worse than
what’s already happened?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hang on a second.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He turns and heads into the house. A few
moments later he reappears, carrying his jacket. Tom leads him across
the driveway. The Damon house is visible across the street. One by one,
the ’lights flick on in its windows. Tom doesi.’t see. He and Frank
reach the steps of his house and start up. FRANK This better be
important. Tom doesn’t answer, just opens the door and gestures for
Frank to go first.</p>
<p><strong>int damon garage night</strong>: In the Damon garage, HANDS
scramble frantically through drawers and come up with a handgun. Now the
hands find a box of bullets, shake them out onto a workbench. The hands
load the gun.</p>
<p><strong>int tom &amp; maggie’s house night</strong>: Tom closes and
locks the front door. Frank looks at him — well? Tom leads him toward
the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>int damon house night</strong>: In the Damon house, the same
hands pull on a pair of leather gloves. The gloved hands screw the top
off a bottle of bourbon, raise the bottle to lips that drink
heavily.</p>
<p><strong>int dining room night</strong>: Frank reacts to the ruined
dining room. He looks at Tom.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What the hell is goin’ on around here? Tom
goes to the trap door and lowers himself halfway through. Frank
follows.</p>
<p><strong>int damon house night</strong>: The gloved hands carry the
bottle of bourbon into the Damon living room, still under construction.
The hands raise the bottle and offer it –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: – to Kurt Damon. Harry, his father, is
the one wearing the gloves. Kurt looks terrified.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Drink up. You got this’started, you’re God
damn well gonna help finish it. Kurt takes the bottle and drinks. He
starts to lower it, but his father forces him to drink more, and more,
until he nearly retches.</p>
<p><strong>int tom’s basement night</strong>: Tom and Frank stand on
opposite sides of the grave, staring down at the corpse of Samantha
Muller. Frank is horrified.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t know it was Adam and Kurt.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It was.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But there’s nothing to… you’re talking like a
nut, that’s what people will say. This is just a body, it doesn’t prove
anything.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: No, it doesn’t. He bends down and lifts
Samantha’s lifeless hand. He pries open her fingers. She’s clutching a
tuft of hair. TOM But this probably will. Frank stares for a long
moment, struck dumb. Finally, he turns his back. His shoulders heave as
he cries, silently.</p>
<p><strong>ext our block night</strong>: In the misty night, the figures
of Harry and Kurt Damon come out of their house and skulk across the
street, toward Tom’s.</p>
<p><strong>ext road into town night</strong>: Maggie drives, as fast as
she can. Up ahead, red lights flash and gates fall in front of a set of
railroad tracks. Train coming. Cars are stopped, waiting for it. Maggie
pulls to a stop at the back of the line – – then thinks better of it.
She drops the car in gear, hauls it around the others, and bolts for the
tracks. The train, nearly upon her, BLARES its horn. Maggie flies across
the tracks and SLAMS through the gate on the other side, a split-second
before the train HURTLES through the intersection behind her. She cuts
it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the other side, and
pulls it back on the road. She drives on, shaking like a leaf.</p>
<p><strong>int basement night</strong>: Frank is still sobbing, his back
to Tom. Tom takes a step toward him, to comfort him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Frank, we have to-</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I mean, what were we supposed to do? Tom
stops. FRANK The kids come to us, she’s already dead, the damage is
done, there’s nothin’ gonna bring her back. But those boys, they’ve got
everything ahead of them. Frank lets his jacket drop to the floor,
revealing his right hand. He’s holding the 38 with the carved white
handle. He turns and looks at Tom.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: FRANK What were we supposed to do? Send
our boys to jail for the rest of their lives? Our own flesh and blood?
Over her?</p>
<p><strong>e3 t house night</strong>: Hairy and Kurt Damon reach the
front steps of Tom’s house. They look up and down the block. There’s no
one out. No one to see.</p>
<p><strong>int basement night</strong>: Frank still has the gun hanging
at his side, tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Who you planning to shoot with that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who do you think?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I think you haven’t decided yet. He’s right,
and Frank knows it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What are you gonna do, Frank? Frank raises the
gun, in a fury.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Frank, I won’t go until you- Frank aims the gun
just to the left of Tom’s head and pulls the trigger. The bullet CRACKS
off the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>get out! get out!</strong>: Tom starts up the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>int dining room night</strong>: Tom crawls out the trap door
and hurries out of the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>int li”ing room night</strong>: Tom races ak. ross the living
room, scoops hi: truck keys off the desk, opens the front door – and
finds himself face to face with Harry Damon and his son Kurt. Harry
SLUGS Tom in the face with the butt end of the gun. Tom falls to the
floor, moaning. They step inside, quickly closing the door behind them.
They don’t speak. Kurt starts to drag Tom, who is still stunned, across
the living room floor. Harry pulls a folded sheet of blue plastic from
inside his jacket and spreads it out on the carpet. Kurt drags Tom into
the middle of the plastic and drops him there. Tom is staring up at
them, starting to regain his senses.</p>
<p><strong>roll him over!</strong>: Kurt does. Tom, regaining his
strength, starts to struggle, but Kurt puts his knee in the middle of.
Tom’s back and pulls his head back. Kurt is blubbering, hysterical.
HARRY</p>
<p><strong>shut the fuck up!</strong>: Harry pulls the gun from his belt
and raises it, putting it to the back of Tom’s head. But then he lowers
it, his hand shaking so hard he can barely hold onto it. He works up his
nerve – HARRY</p>
<p><strong>ahhhhhh!!</strong>: – raises the gun again, puts it to the
back of Tom’s head, cocks it –</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: and a spray of headlights splashes
across the far wall of the room. Nobody moves. Outside, they hear k car
pull into the driveway and park. The engine shuts off. Kurt looks at his
father, panicked. Harry looks down at Tom. Tom closes his eyes and
prays.</p>
<p><strong>ext driveway night</strong>: Maggie-pulls the keys from the
ignition and gets out of the car. She walks toward the house, looking
anxiously around the neighborhood. As she reaches the steps, the light
in the living room window abruptly clicks off. She stops. She starts
forward again, slowly. Now the porch light clicks off. It’s real dark.
Maggie digs the car keys out of her pocket and feels for something on
the key chain. Something that’s not there.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Mace… shit. She starts up the stairs. She
reaches the top. The last light that was on inside clicks off. Now the
house is totally black inside. Remembering something, she pulls her
purse around and feels inside it. She finds the butterfly knife, the one
she found in Tom’s pants. She holds it in her left hand, keys in her
right. She goes to the door. She unlocks the deadbolt. Inside, she hears
a SCURRYING sound. She unlocks the knob. She puts the keys back in her
purse.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She switches the knife to her right
hand, keeping it closed, concealed. She opens the door.</p>
<p><strong>int living room nigf.t</strong>: The room is pitch black, so
b:Aggie leaves the door hanging open. Some light spills in from the
street.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Tom? No answer. She steps inside and fumbles
for a light switch. She flicks it. Nothing happens. MAGGIE Are you here?
She crosses the room to another light and CLICKS its switch. As the
light floods the room: Harry, who was hiding behind the front door,
BANGS it shut. Kurt Damon is still kneeling on Tom’s back, holding one
hand roughly over his mouth, trying to keep him quiet. MAGGIE</p>
<p><strong>wh-</strong>: Harry raises the gun in his hand and points it
at Maggie. She lunges toward Tom, but Harry grabs her by the arm and
flings her roughly to the ground. Tom takes advantage of the moment to
flip Kurt off his back. As the kid flies, Harry whirls, training the gun
on Tom.</p>
<p><strong>don’t move!</strong>: But Tom tries to scramble to his feet.
Harry starts to squeeze the trigger – – and SCREAMS in agony. Looking
down, he sees Maggie has plunged the knife into his thigh. She rips it
out and plunges it in again. Harry’s arm flies up, the gun goes off, and
the bullet RIPS through the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>int jake’s room night</strong>: On the second floor, in
Jake’s bedroom the bullet CRACKS up through the floorboards, tears
through his mattress, and bursts through the little boy’s pillow. The
pillow explodes in a cloud of fea-hers, which fly everywhere. Feathers
everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>int living room night</strong>: Tom crawls over to Maggie and
grabs hold of her, putting himself between her and Harry, who still has
the gun. Over at the fireplace, Kurt Damon pulls the poker out of its
holder. Harry aims the gun. Kurt lunges forward with the poker.</p>
<p><strong>bang! bang!</strong>: Two shots ring out from the doorway to
the dining room. Harry clutches his chest and drops to the floor. They
all turn. Frank stands in the doorway to the dining room, clutching his
38. Kurt rushes toward him, SCREAMING, poker raised high. Frank pulls
the trigger two more times. Kurt goes down. Maggie SCREAMS. Tom huddles
over her. Frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers. It hits the
hardwood with a CLATTER. Tom and Maggie look up. Frank looks at them. In
that red shirt, he is exactly the image Tom saw of him in his dream.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They were gonna kill you, Tommy. You and
Maggie both. Frank turns and walks to the front door. He opens it, walks
out onto the porch, and sits down on the top step, facing the street.
Tom looks at Maggie. They’re both in shock, can hardly speak.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You… okay? Maggie nods, shaking. TOM You saved
me. Baby, I’m alive be;ause of you… They hold each other.</p>
<p><strong>ext front porch night</strong>: Tom comes out of the house.
Frank, sitting on the top porch step, makes no attempt to flee. Tom sits
down beside him. From all around the block, voices are starting to rise
up – “Did you hear that?” “What the hell?!” “Somebody call a cop!” Frank
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Cold-blooded murder. I can’t let something
like that happen. Not here. He looks at Tom. FRANK This is a decent
neighborhood. A few tentative faces gather across the street, staring at
Tom’s house, wondering what the hell. A SIREN wails in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I thought so, Frank. I sure as hell always
thought so.</p>
<p><strong>int hospital corridor day</strong>: A NEWBORN BABY stares up
at us from inside a rolling bassinet. The bassinet is wheeled swiftly
down a hospital corridor by a NURSE. It’s a long trip, wherever it’s
going, but the baby waits patiently, staring up at the ceiling, eyes
open. Above the baby, the lights streak by, white blurs. The Nurse leans
down and looks at the baby. To the baby, she’s just a fuzzy blob.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Almost there!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The baby turns and looks sideways. The
doors of the hospital rooms whiz by, brown smears. NURSE Just around
this corner! She rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in
particular. The baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room.</p>
<p><strong>int hospital room day</strong>: Maggie, who has recently
given birth, struggles to sit up in bad as the Nurse rolls the bassinet
into the room. Tom, grinning, gets up from the chair he’s sitting in
with Jake.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Meet the family! She picks up the baby and
holds her out to Maggie, who takes her eagerly.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Hi, baby, did you sleep well? I sure didn’t.
The baby sees Maggie’s face, blurry, but friendly. Tom leans in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: So you’re the one that’s been kicking my wife!
The baby sees Tom’s blurry face. Jake steps up, onto a step stool, so he
can see over the edge of the bed.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let me see, let me see! Maggie turns the baby
so she’s facing Jake. The infant looks at her older brother. At first,
his face is as blurry as everybody else’s. But slowly, Jake’s face
becomes crystal clear, even though everything around him stays out of
focus. JAKE Can I hold her?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: If you’re very, very careful. Climb up
here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake climbs up on the bed. Maggie puts
some pillows around him and carefully places the baby in his lap. Jake
looks down at the infant. His expression becomes very serious. Gently,
he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the baby’s
forehead, the same way he did to Tom’s forehead that first night. The
baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment. So long, in fact,
that the adults become uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well, they… certainly get along, don’t they?
Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his parents,
thrilled. Then he looks back at his sister. He leans down and whispers
softly in her ear.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t be afraid of s t. Tom and Maggie look at
each other.</p>
