<h1 id="quills">quills</h1>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Dear Reader… I’ve a naughty tale to
tell, plucked from the pages of history. Tarted up, true, but guaranteed
to stimulate the senses…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The story of Mademoiselle Renard, a
ravishing young aristocrat, whose sexual proclivities ran the gamut from
winsome to bestial. Who doesn’t dream of indulging every spasm of lust,
feeding each depraved hunger?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Owing to her noble birth, Mademoiselle
Renard was granted full immunity to do just that, inflicting pain and
pleasure with equal zest, until one day –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Mademoiselle found herself at the mercy
of a man whose skill in the Art of Pain exceeded her own.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: How easily, dear Reader, one changes
from predator to prey! And how swiftly pleasure is taken from some and
given to others!</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Your linens, please.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Your linens.</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: G’morning.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Pss. ’S me.</p>
<p><strong>voice of the marquis</strong>: Careful. The ink’s still
wet.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now hurry.</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: That you, Maddy?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes, Mother. Just taking the bleached
ones out to dry.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Aren’t you going to lend us a hand,
then?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Bouchon!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Remember your manners.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Here it is; the last chapter.</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: Monsieur Masse says he’d like another
manuscript, quick as you please. He’s got himself three presses, and he
can’t print ’em fast enough.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’ll pass the word on, then.</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: I’ll pay you another visit, with a share
of the profits, once its sold.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: Maybe someday you’ll tell me your
name.</p>
<p><strong>black marketeer</strong>: This just in; the very latest from
the Marquis de Sade!</p>
<p><strong>fop</strong>: “Our story concerns a nymph named Justine, as
pretty a maid as ever entered a nunnery, with a body so firm and ripe,
it seemed a shame to commit it to God…”</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: “One morning, the Bishop placed his hand upon
her thigh. ‘Holy Father!,’ cried she, ‘I’ve come to confess my sins, not
commit them anew!’”</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: “heedless, the old priest turned her over
on his knee and lifted her skirts high above her hips, exposing the pink
flesh of her backside. There – between the orbs of her dimpled ass – lay
a blushing rosebud, begging to be… plucked.”</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: “Before Justine could wrestle from his
grasp, this most ungodly man took a communion wafer – the body of our
Lord Jesus Christ – and placed it on the girl’s twitching orifice –”
Must I, Your Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: “As he loosened his manhood from beneath
his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then – with a mighty
thrust – drove it into her very entrails –”</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Seize every copy; we’ll torch them all on
the palace lawn, in full public view.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: As for the author… shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: A word of caution, Sire: we all remember
what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to
death, and history might even regard you as a despot.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: But I am history.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless…
cure the Marquis de Sade… succeed, where countless physicians and
priests have failed…</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: No one can fault Napoleon for merely
bringing a man to his senses.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: Might I suggest that we order an appraisal
of the Charenton Asylum, and the rather notorious inmate in her care.
I’ve the perfect candidate for the job: Doctor Royer-Collard, the
distinguished alienist. He’s a staunchly moral man of impeccable
character and iron resolve –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: My colleagues have called me old
fashioned; even barbaric.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor
an… aggressive… course of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I don’t seek popularity or renown,
Monsieur Delben�. Mine is a higher mission.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: To take God’s tiny blunders… those He
has forsaken… and condition them with the same force… the same rigor…
you would employ to train a feral dog or wild stallion.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It may not be pretty, but it is mercy
just the same.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: It’s the Emperor’s dearest hope that you
might bring your expertise – your proficiency – to the Charenton asylum
–</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Charenton? The administrator there is
quite well-loved, is he not?</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: I’m afraid so; he’s an idealist. You’ll
have to be politic.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Do you know how I define “idealism,”
Monsieur Delben�?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Youth’s final luxury.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Of course, we mustn’t just copy the words;
it’s important that we know what they mean. St. Augustine tells us that
angels and demons walk among us on the earth; that sometimes, they
jointly inhabit the soul of a single man…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Then how can we know who is truly good,
and who is evil?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: We can’t. All we can do is guard against
our own corruption.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’ll practice reading tonight on your
own? For me?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “And so the Professor lifted Colombe’s
skirt high, above her waist. ‘Let me be your Tutor,’ said he, ‘in the
ways of love.’ With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over
her knees, and there – nestled between her legs – as pink as a tulip, as
slick as an eel –”</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: We oughtn’t be reading his nasty stories
–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: No one’s forcing you to listen.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Very well then.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “…he gazed upon her Venus mound; her
flaxen quim; the winking eye of God.”</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You’ve been to his quarters, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Once or twice.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I hear he’s got a whetstone and chisel,
and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: He’s a writer, not a madman.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Then what’s he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>louison</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: That’s not so!</p>
<p><strong>louison</strong>: He writes books so wicked – so black with
evil – that one man killed his wife, after reading ’em…</p>
<p><strong>guerin</strong>: And two young mothers miscarried their
babies!</p>
<p><strong>louison</strong>: I’d say that’s murder enough.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: If you’re going to slander him, then you
don’t deserve to hear his stories –</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I think she’s sweet on him, that’s what I
think.</p>
<p><strong>michette</strong>: It’s not the Marquis she’s sweet on; Is
it, Madeleine?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Fresh linens.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’m hungry for a proper visit.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Don’t start –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Go ahead; you’ve a key. Slip it through
my tiny hole…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Marquis? Where’d you get to, then?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Well….?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Did I frighten you?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You? Frighten me? That’s a good one! I’m
twice as fast as you are. Who’d have thought such a spent body can still
boast such a fertile mind?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s the only frontier I have left,
plumcake.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I suppose you want to know about that
silly book of yours.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It sold like the devil, ’fore they
started burning it.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The peril of composing such incendiary
prose…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I put myself at life and limb. Surely
that’s worth a few louis.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: If only these coins purchased your
other talents, too.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: There’s something else I want from
you.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You’ve already stolen my heart, as well
as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Your publisher says I’m not to leave
without a new manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’ve just the story… inspired by these
very surroundings….</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry
lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally
insane.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Is it awfully violent?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Most assuredly.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Is it terribly erotic?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Fiendishly so.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: But it comes with a price.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: A kiss for each page.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Must I administer them directly, or might
I blow them?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The price, my coquette, is every bit as
firm as I am…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Oh, you. You talk same as you write.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: What are we today, Cleante? A bullfinch,
or a nightengale?</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: There’s but one kind of bird in a madhouse,
Abbe.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Don’t tell me: a loon. Sorry. I’ve heard
that one before –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s a long story, this one.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The climax comes at a higher cost; you
must sit on my lap.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You demand a lot from your readers, you
do.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The story’s thrilling conclusion comes
at a premium.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: What’s that then?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Your maidenhead. And then you must sew
it up as tightly as the day you were born, and come back to me renewed
so I can deflower it a second time.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Some things belong on paper, others in
life. It’s a blessed fool who can’t tell the difference.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mademoiselle LeClerc.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You’re in the nick of time. This old lech
forgot himself. He thought I was a character in one of his nasty
stories!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes, Abbe?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: The next time you feel the urge to visit
the Marquis, I hope you’ll come to confession instead.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s not even noon –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Conversation, like certain portions of
the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it’s lubricated.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s a rare vintage from an obscure
village in Bordeaux. Rather than crush the grape underfoot, they place
the fruit on the belly of a bride and reap its juices when the young
husband steers his vessel into port.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: A full-bodied flavor with just a hint
of wantonness? Bottom’s up!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s from our own cellar. I recognize the
taste.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I should’ve told you it was the blood
of Christ; you’d believe that, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: We treat you well enough here, don’t we
Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique
writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an
ostrich –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s true, dear-heart, you’ve spoiled
me pink.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: In exchange, we ask only that you follow
the rules. Now you know as well as I do… you’re not to entertain
visitors in your quarters.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’m entertaining you now, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’m not a beautiful young prospect, ripe
for corruption.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t be so sure.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge
these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they’ll govern you less
in life.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’ll fill page after page, I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: They’ve got no right, sending someone to
sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won’t take orders from a
stranger.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You needn’t worry, Valcour. It’s
administrative, nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Please don’t eat the paint, Pascal.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Bravo, Dauphin. It’s far better to paint
fires than to set them, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: That’s all for today, thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to
welcome you to Charenton –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: This may feel a tad awkward, my
friend, but it needn’t be. I’ve merely come to oversee your work here;
understood?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It’s a formality; truly.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’re a man of Science; I’m a man of God.
Charenton stands to profit from us both, I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’ll need an office on the grounds;
someplace to store my things.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If you don’t mind my asking… why has the
Emperor taken such sudden interest in my… our… affairs?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It seems a particular patient of
yours has captured his fancy.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Why, why, WHY should this be happening
to me?!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Once again, gentleman!</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “I’m just a lowly cobbler, and I have been
all my life. But with this shoe, I’m asking you to be a cobbler’s wife
–</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s a dreadful play, true! A festering
pustule on the face of literature. Why the parchment it’s written upon
isn’t worthy to wipe my ass! BUT YOU NEED NOT MAKE IT WORSE! Say your
lines with conviction, ma cherie! Like a true actor!</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: But I’m not an actor; I’m a dyspeptic.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Seduce her, you goon!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I understand he practices the very
crimes he preaches in his fiction.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: A few indiscretions in his youth.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I’ve
read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a
crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a
prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds
with wax –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I hope you’ll judge him by his progress
here, and not his past reputation.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: He’s made a great success of our Little
Theater; there’s seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic
value.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Playing dress-up with cretins? That
sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Homo perversio, Doctor. A species that
thrives in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: This is Dr. Royer-Collard; he’s joining us
here in an…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: …advisory capacity.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Welcome to our humble madhouse, Doctor.
I trust you’ll find yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Why is he in your care, and not a
proper prison?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: His wife’s influence.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: His wife’s?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Better to have an insane spouse than a
criminal one.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And he’s never once attempted
escape?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: A man of his notoriety? He wouldn’t last a
day on the streets without capture.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Besides, every wholesome thing he might
desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world’s great
books, music lessons, watercolor exercises –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: What is the impact of all these
amenities upon his psyche?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: He no longer roars or spits. He no longer
taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And his writing?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Oh. That.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Well…?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s essential to his recovery; a
purgative for the toxins in his mind.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Do you favor its publication?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: For sale? To the general public? Certainly
not; it’s unprintable.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You have to believe me, I had no idea
–</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: All France is aghast at this book,
yet you’ve not heard of it?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’ve taken vows to live my life within
these walls; not outside them.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Abbe, I admire you; I do. You’ve a
conviction… an idealism… peculiar to the very young. And so I’ll be
candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit… the most
severe instructions.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Unless we set Charenton on a straight
and narrow course, she’ll be shut down forever by order of the
Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Shut down?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: In their eyes, the Marquis is the
surest barometer of your progress here.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But he’s one among some two hundred wards
–</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Have you tried bleeding him with
leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Why? So he’ll learn to fear punishment,
rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’re a sentimental man.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis’
unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a
deterrent.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You find this amusing, do you?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: On the contrary. Let me take up this
matter with the Marquis myself –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And place my reputation at stake?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Charenton is my life’s work. To have her
wrested from beneath me now –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’ve stringent standards, true, but
I’ve something else the Ministry failed to take into account; a
heart.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Thank-you, Doctor. I’ll effect his
contrition; you have my word.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: What is it, Abbe?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: The Marquis. He’s embarrassed us… …before
Napoleon himself.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: He’s been slipping manuscripts to his
publisher.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: He has?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I place my trust too carelessly,
Madeleine.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: This is a complete… an utter…
…disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Yes! It is! The paper’s cheap, the
type’s too small –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: What did you do? Bribe one of the
guards?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: But you implored me to write! For
curative purposes, to stave off my madness –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But you’ve no right to publish! Behind my
back, without my sanction!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Have you truly read the book in
question? Or did you run – straightaway – to the dog-eared pages?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Enough to discern its tenor.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: And –?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s not even a proper novel! It’s nothing
but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an
exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not
to mention the endless repetition of words like “nipple” and “pikestaff”
–</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: There I was taxed; it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: And such puny scope! Nothing but the very
worst in man’s nature!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I write of the great, eternal truths
that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit,
we fuck, we kill and we die.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But we also fall in love; we build cities,
we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as
well?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s a fiction, not a moral
treatise.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But isn’t that the duty of art? To elevate
us above the beast?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not
mine.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: One more trick like this, and I’ll be
forced to revoke all your liberties!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s that Doctor fellow, isn’t it? He’s
come to usurp your place here, hasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: More than your writing’s at stake. The
Ministry has threatened us with closure.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: They can’t be serious.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Our future lies in the stroke of your
pen.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Mightier than the sword indeed.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Put yourself in my place. I’ve your fellow
patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they’ve no place to go. No
manner in which to clothe or feed themselves –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Fuck ’em! They’re half-wits and
pinheads. Let ’em die on the streets, as Nature intended.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You among them?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If ever I showed you a kind hand,
Marquis…. If ever I granted you walking privileges on a Spring day, or
slipped an extra pillow beneath your door… if ever I shared your wine,
laughed at your vulgarities, or humored you with argument… then you will
oblige me now. For your sake, and for all Charenton.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You’ve a touch of the poet, too;
perhaps you should take up the quill.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Do I have your word?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Have no fear, Abbe.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I swear; all that Charenton has given
me, I’ll repay a hundred-fold.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If you only mean to dupe me again –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Honestly! You cut me to the core!
What’s the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if –
when I finally succumb – when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous
conduct – you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in
your own medicine?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: My, my. At Charenton, even the walls
have eyes.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Mmmm… don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I spoke to him with reason and compassion;
the tools which serve us best here.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And –?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: He’s sworn to obedience.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: He’s more than a patient, Doctor; the
Marquis is my friend –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You keep strange company, Abbe. But
if you truly have matters in hand here –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: – then I’ve friends of my own to
visit.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’ve come for my bride.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: We’d not expected you for some
time. Simone has not yet come of age.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’ve taken a new post at Charenton; I
need the succor only a wife can provide.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: You remember
Dr. Royer-Collard.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’d not forget the man to whom I was
promised.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: He’s come to collect you.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Today? This minute?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: My apologies, Mademoiselle; I’d no
time to write.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: Be grateful, child. It’s my
experience that most poor girls who are orphaned never wed; They wind up
spinsters, or worse still… nuns.</p>
<p><strong>sister noirceuil</strong>: Thank God that Fortune has spared
you from such a Fate.</p>
<p><strong>sister rose fatima</strong>: Good-bye, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>sister flavie</strong>: God bless, Simone.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: The Emperor wishes to ensure your comfort
while at Charenton.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: Consider the chateau a gift, provided
you’re willing to finance the necessary repairs.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: Monsieur Prouix is the court’s most
promising young architect; he’s at your disposal.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It has possibilities, yes.
Simone?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’m to live here?</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: The place hasn’t been occupied since the
Terror; it belonged to the Duc de Blangis, an avowed monarchist. The
Jacobins were most… unforgiving.</p>
<p><strong>delben�</strong>: His wife was trying to escape; they caught
her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets. “There but for the
grace of God”… eh, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I don’t shed tears over the past,
Monsieur Delben�; I look to the future.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: We’d best quarry fresh marble, don’t
you think?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’re to humor my wife in all
things. If she wants Venetian glass, she’s to have it. Italian tile,
Dutch velvet; spare no expense. But in her bedchamber, see to it that
the door locks from the outside. And on her windows… an iron grate.</p>
<p><strong>prouix</strong>: Bars, sir?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: In the convent, Simone was spared the
world’s temptations. I won’t have her falling prey to them now.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: She’s a rare bird; I intend to keep
her caged.</p>
<p><strong>guerin</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sister rose fatima</strong>: It’s a scandal, truly. Him,
pretending to be a God-fearing man!</p>
<p><strong>sister flavie</strong>: And that’s not all; he’s far too old
to marry, and she’s far too young –</p>
<p><strong>michette</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>guerin</strong>: – I say – the comely little thing – is
barely sixteen –</p>
<p><strong>louison</strong>: – I say – ah! – she’s even younger –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>michette</strong>: – from a convent, no less; she was meant
to be a nun –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: – he’s old enough to have fathered her
twice over –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Why, the hypocrite. It has all the
makings of a farce, hasn’t it? Run straightaway, and tell Franval to
cancel rehearsal…</p>
<p><strong>mademoiselle clairwil</strong>: Abbe de Coulmier! You rascal!
Your comedies have become quite the rage; I had to claw my way to a
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I can hardly take credit –</p>
<p><strong>madame bougival</strong>: And so expertly acted! That
charming young man in last week’s comedy… …I’d no idea he was an
imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Everyone has talents, if we look for
them.</p>
<p><strong>madame bougival</strong>: Mmm. Yes. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>madame bougival</strong>: Is that the new Doctor? You must be
thrilled. Such a renowned expert, right here, at Charenton!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Ah! Curtain time.</p>
<p><strong>mademoiselle clairwil</strong>: I’ll say one thing for him;
he has a beautiful daughter.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A CARRIAGE, PULLING UP TO THE STEPS. A
MYSTERIOUS:WOMAN disembarks. She’s in her middle years, with a dark
bonnet to disguise her identity. She ascends the steps to CHARENTON.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Remember, gentlemen! Inside each of
your delicate minds… your distinctive bodies… ART is waiting to be born.
So let’s give the Doctor a performance I hope he’ll remember
forever…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil –
and of course – the Marquis’ wife –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Oh indeed?</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Begging your pardon; it’s time to
begin.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The dedication, word for word; it’s
every bit as crucial as the play which follows –</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Madames and Messieurs, there’s been a
change in tonight’s program.</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: We will not be performing The Happy
Shoemaker.</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Instead, we’d like to premiere a new play
in honor of the newly-appointed Dr. Royer-Collard and his lovely bride,
married nary a week today –</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: – a comedy entitled…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: The Crimes of Love!</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: …The Crimes of Love, written by one of
Charenton’s very own wards!</p>
<p><strong>pitou</strong>: My hat, my hat!</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: Oh Sister Saint-Fond, whither do we go?
Passing o’er rivers, canyons and snow?</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Hurry, Eugenie, for we must not
tarry; I deliver you now to the man you shall marry!</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Once you have rested, at your
leisure – he’ll coach you in the ways of pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: At last she arrives, my hard-won bride!
Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you’ll find such treasures
await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: Such gallantry in men is – sadly – a
rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: Thank you, dear Sister, for abetting me
so; Bringing her here to this secluded Chateau! Little does she know the
terrors in store; when I tutor her in –</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: …les crimes de l’amour!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Leave at once –</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: But it’s just begun –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Leaving so soon? Oh, but of course!
You’ve seen it before.</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: Quickly, my suckling, out of your
clothes! My scepter awaits; how solid it grows!</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: Stop, I beg you! Have pity, I say! You’re
not my lover; you’re a monstrous rou�!</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: Do as I say! Stick your legs in the air!
It’s true, I’m a pig and you’ve truffles down there –</p>
<p><strong>madame bougival</strong>: Who do you suppose is to blame? The
author… or his Muse?</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: Good heavens, what’s this? Such a wicked
sensation! A feeling somewhere between shame and elation! Yes! That’s
the way; use your tongue like a wand in much the same manner as Sister
Saint-Fond!</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Quickly; the second act!</p>
<p><strong>the libertine</strong>: I had a suspicion the Sister was
Sapphic!</p>
<p><strong>the ingenue</strong>: I’d tell you more, but it’s simply too
graphic. Suffice it to say, she’s a preference for lasses! Even at
Vespers, she always made passes –</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get
on your back! Let’s try it dorsal!</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: Was ever a man more risqu�? He wants to
take me every way!</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: Ahhhhhggggg…</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: I’ll plunder every lovely pore until
you’re week and cry “no more!”</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: I tremble with fear! You’re bound to pound
the quivering lips of my Venus mound!</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: And then – to prove your truly mine –
I’ll plunder you, darling, from behind!</p>
<p><strong>ingenue</strong>: What of my lips, will you soil them too?
When you’ve broken every other taboo?</p>
<p><strong>libertine</strong>: I’ll fill every slippery hollow; if
you’re obliging, then you’ll swallow!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Take him to the infirmary for a plaster,
and an ice bath. That’ll cool him.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Has he hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: His stinking breath caused my eyes to
run, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You mean to take us all down with you?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t be absurd; it’s only a play.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s only a play!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It was fiction, of course.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It was not inspired by circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: No. It most certainly was not.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You ought to be ashamed, Abbe.
Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: That’s not our intent –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: – a veritable freak show for tourists
and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus.
The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend – playwright
emeritus of the madhouse –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’ll do everything in my power –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Do more. Otherwise, I’ll be forced to
report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the
asylum.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I hope you’re satisfied; he’s shut down
the theater.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: He can’t do that to me.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: How can one man possibly be so
selfish?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and
– apparently – he didn’t like what he saw.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: What the devil –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If you won’t be true to your word, then
you’ve left me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: But I kept my promise! I didn’t publish
–</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Perhaps – in time – you’ll earn them back
through good behavior –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You can’t –! You mustn’t –! I’ve all
the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on
paper –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Try reading, for a change. The writer who
produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Start with the Bible; it’s cheerier, and
more artfully written.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: That monstrous God of yours? He strung
up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He’d do
to me.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You know what sacrilege is, don’t you? The
last refuge of the failed provocateur.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’ll die of loneliness! I’ve no company
but the characters I create –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Whores and pederasts? You’re better off
without them.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I have a proposition.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You always do.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Madeleine. She’s besotted with me;
she’d do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I don’t know who you insult more; her or
me.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Part the gates of heaven,” as it were
–</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You’re tense, darling. You could use a
long, slow screw.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Good day, Marquis.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: THEN BUGGER ME!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: GOD DAMN YOU, ABBE! HAVE YOU NO TRUE
SENSE OF MY CONDITION? OF ITS GRAVITY? My writing is involuntary, like
the beating of my heart! My constant erection! I can’t help it!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: MAGGOT!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
And a maniac is matchless for invention.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I’ve done just as you bade me; I’ve
paid a visit to the woodcarver. He laughed and called me a whore, but
took my money just the same.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I don’t know which gives you greater
pleasure; the objects themselves, or the humiliation I endure procuring
them on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: And – last but not least – I’ve
brought you aniseed drops and some chocolate pastilles.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Did you now, Madame?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: They’re filled with cream, yes? You
know I shan’t touch them, unless they’re positively bursting – erupting
– with cream.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: What else have you brought that I might
nibble upon?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Oh, Donatien… you mustn’t…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Hm? Tell me. What other treats?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: ….shame on you, truly…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: For fuck’s sake, woman! BONBONS? I’m to
sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little
sweetmeats, when what I truly need – what I truly require – are a few
quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Forgive me, I beg you –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t you see? I’ve been raped! Far
more egregiously than any of my wretched characters –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: How was I to know, my darling?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: How was I to tell you? By writing a
letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I beg you, Donatien… as your wife…
your only ally… you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You’ve come to lecture me?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: To flaunt your deviance in public?
Upon a stage?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: They’ve put you up to this, haven’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: You ought to court the Doctor’s
favor, not his contempt.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I ought to carve my name into his
backside, and fill the wounds with salt –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: You’re here – safe – surrounded by
brick and mortar; but my prison is far crueler. It has no walls.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Everywhere I go, they point and
whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went
to church… the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was
already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s the way of all martyrs, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Give me back my anonymity, that’s all
I ask! Let me be invisible again!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Tell me; have you done anything to
secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought
audience with the Emperor –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: He refuses to be seen in my company!
He blanches at the mention of your name –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s a convenience, isn’t it, having
your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or
hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one
pleasurable use! YOU’RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU’RE ONE AMONG MY MANY
JAILERS, AREN’T YOU?</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: What in the name a’ God –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Take this cow away; I can’t look at
her.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Perhaps you’ll find a place for her in
the West Wing, eh? AMONG THE HYSTERICS?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: LOCK HER UP AS WELL, SO SHE KNOWS HOW
IT FEELS! THE GORGON! THE SOW!</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: For a woman of humble origin, your
wife certainly has refined tastes! When I suggest granite for the foyer,
she’s quick to counter with Peruvian marble. Peruvian marble! It costs a
fortune to import!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Whatever her heart desires, Monsieur
Prouix.</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: I’d like nothing better, sir, than
to grant her every wish. But on the modest sum you’ve accorded me – I’m
an architect, not a magician –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I must see the Doctor at once. It’s a
matter of dire urgency…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It is customary to write first, and
request an appointment –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Desperation has driven me past
etiquette, all the way to frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: My schedule is not subject to the
whims of lunatics.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in
a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I pray you: be succinct.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: You’re new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps
you’re not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: With all due respect, Madame, all
France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won’t
you, Monsieur Prouix?</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: Happily, sir. Your servant,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Madame, please.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I assume you’ve come to plead for
clemency on your husband’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest
hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he
perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion
for the rodents and the worms.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I stand corrected, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: If you can’t cure him – truly cure
him – then – at least – I beg you – harness the beast that rages in his
soul.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It’s not so easily done, Madame.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’re aware, are you not, that it
costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton…</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I pay his stipend every month, far
more dutifully than I should.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: That barely covers the cost of his
room. There’s nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates
to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Perhaps if you were to buttress your
entreaties with the means to oblige them…</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I am not a wealthy woman.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: But you’ve a pension, haven’t you,
from the sale of his books?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: It’s tainted money, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: What a beautiful thought,
Marquise.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: What thought is that?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: That ill-gotten funds, borne of his
degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: If you’re truly determined to step
out of the shadow of your husband’s celebrity –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Oh, but I am!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: – words alone are insufficient.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: It’s beyond perversity. That honor
should carry a price tag…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Imagine; old friends once again
deigning to kiss your hand. “Why, Marquise. Enchanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Don’t toy with me, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Now is the time to secure your
epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton’s most revered
philanthropist… or Satan’s Bride.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Rest assured that your generosity
speeds your husband ever faster toward a cure.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: The Peruvian marble; without
question.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I am eternally in your debt.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And I in yours.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Doctor… Can I impart to you his
cruelest trick?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Once… long ago… in the folly of
youth… he made me love him.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Madeleine, my sweet… can you smuggle a
paper and quill to me?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I don’t dare. The Doctor’s got his eye on
you, sharper than ever now.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Dr. Montalivet was – politely put – a
diminutive man. When flaccid, his member was little more than a bobbin,
and – when enflamed – it towered a mere four inches. To compensate, he
strove to impress his lady love with a host of other endowments; fine-
wine, fresh game, and a house as large as his other fortunes were
small…”</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: We’ve ceiling beams en route from
Provence, and – next week – a muralist arrives from Paris, to paint a
trompel’oeil in the ballroom.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Doesn’t that please you?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Very much.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’d prefer to have our brandy in the
salon. There we can sit… side-by- side… before the fire.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’d rather read, thank-you.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You prefer a book to your husband’s
company?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Well, no wonder; I’m only flesh and
blood. That’s no match – is it? – for the printed page.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Good evening, then. I hope you enjoy
your solitude.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I apologize if I took a severe
tone.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You can’t be blamed for your naivet�,
not when it’s chief among your charms.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Perhaps the Sisters failed to
instruct you in the ways of marriage; the nightly duty of a wife to her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Your linens!</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Now or never!</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: If you won’t read it to your own
Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s not your cup of tea, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Come now, darling, give it a
read.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “Monsieur Bouloir was a man whose erotic
tastes might discreetly be described as ‘post-mortem.’”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “A habitu� of cemeteries, his proudest
conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years.”</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Oh, it’s terrible! It’s too, too
terrible! Well. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “The vigor with which he made love caused
her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he
accorded any woman…”</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: “Well worth the dig!”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You asked my name once; it’s
Madeleine.</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: Sweet, then? Like the pastry?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Haven’t you a name yourself?</p>
<p><strong>horseman</strong>: Ride away with me someday, and perhaps
I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Your mother may be blind as a bat,
but you’ve a keen pair of eyes, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Mama’s blind on account of the lye in the
laundry kettles; soaking sheets for lunatics cost the poor woman her
sight.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: This could cost her far more –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’ll get more from her with kindness
than you will with force.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: What could cause a tincture like
this?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’m only a laundress; not a
detective.</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Now’s not the time to be cheeky,
Maddy.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Perhaps your kettles are stained with
rust. Maybe the lye’s turned rancid. Or maybe… just maybe…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: …these sheets once belonged to our
friend, The Marquis.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: We’ve over two hundred beds. They
could’ve been anybody’s.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Such a fine thread-count? Decorated
in his very own script?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: She’s lying. It shows in her
face.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: No! Don’t you dare! Touch that, and
I’ll have your testicles on toast! MORONS! THIEVES! Help! That’s
fifteenth century, you goon! PUT THOSE IVORIES DOWN –</p>
<p><strong>louison</strong>: Almost done, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Remember – anything – ANYTHING he might
fashion as a quill. His entire room, stripped bare.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: So! The Doctor cracks the whip, and you
dance!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to
death?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: His rug.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: And my chaise – am I being denied the
privilege of sitting – of plopping down my ass –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: That’s a Turkish weave, you numbskull;
it costs more than you’ll earn in your lifetime –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Valcour. His chair.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Fine! Take it! Take it all! Here –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Careful, it’s slippery, you’ve no idea
where it’s been. A box of Kama Sutra powder, ready to dust whomever you
please…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: And we mustn’t forget Mary, sweet Mary,
the Jewish Whore; God’s little harlot!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Virgin birth – ha! An entire religion,
built on an oxymoron!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing
but water at every meal –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: – water! –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: – and your meat shall be de-boned.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Because your writing continues,
unchecked.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I DIDN’T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I
ONLY RECORD IT!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest
nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification
–</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Morbid gratification? NO! I write what
I’ve seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We’re all lined
up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of
blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I’ve been to hell, young man. You’ve
only read about it.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I am sorry, Marquis. Truly.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Tell me, Priest. These chastity vows of
yours. How strict are they?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Suppose you only put it in her mouth
–</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: PIOUS LITTLE WORM –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: In conditions of adversity, the artist
flourishes.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Psst. Madeleine. I beg you…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: What have they done to you now?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I
haven’t the words to describe them. If you’ve an ounce of pity in your
heart, you’ll throw caution aside, and unlock my door…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: God help me; I don’t dare.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t be a dunce, child. I’ve a
surprise for you. Now open the frigging door.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: My newest book begins at my right cuff,
continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left
shoe…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Take your leave, quickly, so you won’t
be blamed for my misbehavior.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You can’t be a proper writer without a
touch of madness, can you?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Traffic with the Devil, Maddy, and you’ll
pay the Devil’s price.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Valcour! Valcour!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Feast your eyes!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Two chapters, one for each cheek! MY
WRITING LIVES!</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “Sister Mary Quesnet had the most dextrous
vulva in all France –”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “– so he set about removing her teeth
–”</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “She’d never been with another woman, never
mind her own mother –”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “– twin orbs of delight – with her puckered
mouth, she swallowed him whole –”</p>
<p><strong>pitou</strong>: “She wore her ass proudly –”</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Take this beast back to his cage.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t tell me. You’ve come to read my
trousers.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t keep me in suspense. What’ll it
be? Fifty lashes? A night on the rack?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I won’t sully my hands with him.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Nor should you. That’s the first rule
of politics, isn’t it? The man who orders the execution never drops the
blade.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’re lucky it falls to me to punish
you.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If it were up to the Doctor, you’d be
flayed alive.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: A man after my own heart…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: What in God’s name am I to do with you?
The more I forbid, the more you’re provoked!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I could be convinced to abandon my
writing, quite voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: What on earth would that require?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: A night spent with the partner of my
choice.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You expect me to pimp Madeleine?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I wasn’t talking about Madeleine.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Coulmier, you animal!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex
without flirtation is merely rape!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: NOW STRIP.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: My shoes; they’re naught but
punctuation.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: My jewels, family or otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Your breeches as well.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You started this little game; you
finish it. Or haven’t you the courage?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I thought not.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It’s a potent aphrodisiac, isn’t it?
Power over another man.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Your wig. Remove your wig.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’ll no longer spread your insidious
gospel, where art’s magnitude is the breadth of its depravity! FROM NOW
ON, YOU WILL NOT EVEN WRITE YOUR OWN IGNOMINIOUS NAME!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Are your convictions so fragile that
mine cannot stand in opposition to them? Is your God so flimsy? So weak?
For shame!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself, Marquis. You’re
not the Anti-Christ. You’re nothing but a malcontent who knows how to
spell.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I saw her with my own eyes. She put the
key in the latch, just as proud as you please –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: FREE HER. NOW.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: He’ll do no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s a weak man who tests his mettle on
the backs of children –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: This child let loose the beast from
its cage –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine’s not wicked. It’s the Marquis
who’s corrupted her. That’s not her fault; it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Your dagger. Give me your dagger.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: LEAVE HER DULY STRUNG.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I was wrong to free him, but so are you –
for taking all his treasures – his quills and his ink –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Not now, or we’re both done for.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If only blood will appease you, then shed
mine.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’d suffer in her stead?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Abbe, no –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Go ahead. Bind them. Bind them.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: If you want to martyr yourself, Abbe,
do it for God. Not a chambermaid. Now put your clothes back on.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Had I known your taste in novels, I never
would’ve taught you to read.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Don’t say that; reading’s my
salvation.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But why must you indulge in his
pornography?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s a hard day’s wages, slaving away for
madmen. What I’ve seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop
an already ghastly existence?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I put myself in his stories. I play the
parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Why not act the role of heroines instead?
Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: If I wasn’t such a bad woman on the page,
Abbe, I’ll hazard I couldn’t be such a good woman in life.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: This is no place for a child like you.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Good God, Marquise –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I’m on the brink of bankruptcy; my
husband’s resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask
you?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: This is neither the time nor the
place –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: If only you’d remained true to our
contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of
nails –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I can say, with the utmost sincerity,
that every franc you’ve given me has been put to sterling use.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: That much is painfully clear.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Gentleman, if you’ll excuse us… only
a moment… thank you, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’ve no right to assault me in this
fashion; I’ll call for my footman. I’ll have you removed –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I
be betrayed by every man I meet –</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Ah! This must be the little
Madame.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: I must confess, I envy you.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Envy me? But why?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Your husband’s name brings you honor,
doesn’t it? You can walk down the street without insult; without falling
debris.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: But suppose the whole world knew that
all this splendor was the result of fraudulence? Of extortion?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Why has she come here?</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: Public scorn carries a terrible
sting. Trust me. I’m a woman who knows.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It’s libelous; you wouldn’t dare.</p>
<p><strong>renee pelagie</strong>: And why not? My fortune, siphoned
away. My reputation, past repair. I’ve nothing left to lose. Silence my
husband, or you’ll come to know an infamy to rival his own.</p>
<p><strong>first vendor</strong>: Psst… Mademoiselle…. I’ve only a few
doses of Spanish fly left…</p>
<p><strong>second vendor</strong>: Cat-o’-nine-tails here, guaranteed to
raise a welt…</p>
<p><strong>third vendor</strong>: Curious, aren’t you? If I can pleasure
me-self, I can pleasure you, too…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’m in search of a book; perhaps you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: I’ve only got one copy left; rescued it
meself from the bonfire.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Please hurry. My husband locks the door at
dusk.</p>
<p><strong>pawnbroker</strong>: Sweet little thing like you shouldn’t be
reading such filth anyway.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I grew up in a convent, sir. Everything I
know in the world, I owe to books.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “To the young maidens of the
world…”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Wrest yourselves free from the tyranny
of virtue, and taste without shame the pleasures of the flesh…”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Male power lies in the clench of a
fist. But a woman’s power lies elsewhere…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “…in the velvet cavity betwixt her
thighs…”</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: It’s late, Simone, darling. Put your
poems aside.</p>
<p><strong>prouix</strong>: Or – if you prefer – a Florentine
tapestry?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Are you a literary man?</p>
<p><strong>prouix</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I so admire men with an appetite for…
books.</p>
<p><strong>prouix</strong>: Madame, how could you… have you actually
read this volume?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: I’ve memorized it. Would you like me to
recite?</p>
<p><strong>prouix</strong>: There comes a time in a young lady’s life
when she has to cast book’s aside, and learn from experience.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: That, Monsieur, requires a teacher.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’ve good news; I hope you’ll agree.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’ve found employment for you both with
the Widow Rougemont in town.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’ll have your own cottage on the
grounds, and ten francs a month to use as you please.</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: You’re more than a priest; you’re an
angel! Ain’t he, Maddy?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s because of the Marquis, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: In part, yes.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: He’s not the man who’s cast a shadow
here.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: The Doctor’s a respected man, a friend of
the court –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I haven’t been to see the Marquis for
ages. And I won’t – ever again – I swear it. I won’t speak to him, I
won’t even utter his name –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Is that a promise you can truly keep?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Charenton has changed; it’s not safe for
you here.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I’ve you to look after me, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: “Most Esteemed Dr. Royer-Collard.
At long last, your Chateau is complete.”</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: “You’ll find everything in its
assigned place.”</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: “The chintz draperies, the English
bell pulls, even the ivory door stops. Only one detail is missing…”</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: “…your wife.”</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Tell him I’m no fool. A prison’s still a
prison, even with Chinese silk and chandeliers.</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: “By the time you read this, we’ll
be long gone; bound for England or points beyond…”</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Tell him – if he uncovers our whereabouts –
you’ll slit your wrists with a razor, and I’ll plunge a hat- pin through
my heart.</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: You’d do that, rather than forsake
our love?</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: No. But tell him I would.</p>
<p><strong>simone</strong>: Sign it quickly. Then you can ravish me
again. On linens for which he so dearly paid.</p>
<p><strong>monsieur prouix</strong>: Yes, on the satin twill… and then,
I beg you, on the bear-skin rug in his study… and finally… as a crowning
gesture… we’ll leave puddles of love on the Peruvian marble!</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal the marquis, strapped into the
calming</strong>: CHAIR IN THE DUNGEON</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Show your face! I’ve a right to see my
Inquisitor! You’ve an aptitude for torture I really quite admire – we’re
cut from the same cloth, you and I –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: It thrills you, doesn’t it, to hurt me
thus? Look, you’re solid as bone, you’re straining your trousers –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Stop, I beg you! I’ll write dainty
stories! Odes to Virtue! If even your God will forgive me, so should you
–</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: EACH ABUSE – EACH TORMENT – ONLY
CALCIFIES MY RAGE! DON’T YOU SEE, YOU MORON? YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS FUCK!
THE LONGER YOU CONTINUE YOUR VEXATIONS, THE DEEPER YOU ROOT MY
PRINCIPLES IN MY HEART –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You shouldn’t be calling on me, not at
this hour; suppose the nightwatchman saw you, or the cook –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Don’t turn us out, Abbe.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: “Turn you out?”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s a sin against God for me to refuse
your kindness. But my heart’s held fast here…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: By whom? The Marquis?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Mother’s not half so blind as you.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine, I… there are certain things…
feelings… we must not voice.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: They incite us to act. In ways we should
not… cannot… a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Don’t. Shhh. You mustn’t…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Go back to your room. Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: What? What’ve I done?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Don’t come back, not tonight, not again
–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You’ll hate me now, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I love you, Madeleine, as a parishioner –
as a child of God –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: My vows are mine and mine alone. So are my
failings. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: “…Lead us not into temptation…”</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: “…but deliver us from evil…”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: They’ve taken your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: They decreed me a savage, and now they
have made me one.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Surely you’ve seen a man naked.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It’s only been described to me. In your
books.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I must say, in your novels you stoke the
most unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: You’re far crueler than I, my
sweet.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: The Abbe’s sending me away. He fears for
me here, what with the likes of you –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t be fooled, Madeleine! He fears
for himself. He’s like a man starving, and you – ha! – you’re like a
pork chop dolloped with heavy cream –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: He’s a man of God; he’s true to his
vows.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: First and foremost, he’s a MAN. You
remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t you see, my sweet? In us, they
see their own appetites, stripped bare. And so we are reviled; we are
beaten, we are trounced, we are ridiculed, and we are silenced. What’s
to be done? It’s the artist’s lot.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: It needn’t be; not if you’ve another
story.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: How do you propose I write it? With
dust, upon the air?</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You could whisper it through the walls of
your cell.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Yes; that’s it! A final volley from us
both!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Go on, child.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to
your neighbor, Cleante. He’ll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who’ll
whisper it to his neighbor Franval –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: – who’ll whisper it to Bouchon –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: – whose cell lies next to the linen
cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I’ll commit it to
paper!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Yes! You shall. Of course you shall
–</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: A tale more horrible than all the rest
combined!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Something to make the angels weep, and
the Saints to gasp for air…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Practice your handwriting, my lovely.
So you’ll do my words justice.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You don’t fear the Marquis’ sway on me.
You fear your own.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: If you’d grant me a final favor, I’d like
the chance to explain myself –</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Don’t come any closer, Abbe. God’s
watching.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Psst… Cleante! Are you there? ARE YOU
THERE?</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: Marquis? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: For fuck’s sake, who else would it be?
The witching hour’s arrived; you’ve alerted the others, yes?</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: I’m no longer a man! I awoke to discover
I’d turned into a sparrow!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Yes, well, I awoke to discover I’d
turned into a cat. If you don’t do as I say, I’ll sink my little fangs
into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your
bones.</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: At your service, Count.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Now give the signal.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: And so we begin…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Our story concerns the prostitute
Fanchon, whom Nature equipped with a tight and downy fissure between her
thighs, and the most finely cleft ass ever moulded by the hand of
God…”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: CLEANTE!</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “Fanchon was a prostitute with a tight and
downy fissure between her thighs…”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: …the most finely cleft ass…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: My glorious prose, filtered through the
minds of the insane? Who knows? They might improve it.</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “…and the most finely cleft ass ever
moulded by the hand of God!”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “…a harlot, she was, name of Fanchon, with
a downy fissure and a heavenly ass…”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Psst… Bouchon…</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: …BOUCHON!</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “…’S about a harlot named Fanchon, with a
downy fissure and a heavenly ass….”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Bouchon! You’ve something for me, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “…a downy fissure, and a heavenly ass…”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: You must remember each word, exactly as
it’s told to you. Yes? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “One day, Fanchon’s first client was a
surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds
of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle…”</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon.
He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh,
inspecting follicles…”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “One day, a surgeon came to visit Fanchon.
He felt her naked skin, pulling at her folds, fingering every hair…”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “One day, a surgeon came to visit… feeling
her naked skin… pulling at her folds…”</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “One day, a surgeon… ran his fingers over
her naked skin… her naked skin… naked…”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: …yes, I’ve got that bit…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “What shall I ready?” asked Fanchon.
“My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?”</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “What shall I ready?” asked Fanchon. “My
mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “What’ll it be?” she asked. “My mouth, my
ass or my succulent oyster?”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “My mouth,” she asked, “My ass or my
succulent oyster?”</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “Which hole? My mouth, my ass or my succ…
succ… succ… succulent oyster?”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “None!” cried the surgeon, brandishing
his scalpel. “I’ll carve new orifices where… there… were… none…
before!”</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “None!” cried the surgeon, brandishing his
scalpel. “I’ll carve new orifices where there were none before!”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “None!” cried the surgeon. “I’ll carve new
orifices where there were none before!”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “None!” he cried. “I’ll carve new orifices
where there were none before!”</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “I’ll carve new… new… NEW… orifices where
there were none before!”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “With that, Fanchon expelled a scream
so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her
tongue –”</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so
extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her
tongue –”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “With that, she screamed so loud that the
surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue –”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: “She screamed – so long and so loud – that
the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue –”</p>
<p><strong>bouchon</strong>: “She screamed, so he felt he should – he
felt he ought – to tear out her tongue –”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “To seal the wound, he took a poker
from the fire –”</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: “…a poker… he took a poker from the
fire…”</p>
<p><strong>dauphin</strong>: “A poker from the fire! From the fire… from
the fire… the fire, the fire, the fire!”</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Dauphin? What’s the next bit? You must tell
me the next bit…</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Please. The words. Tell me the words.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: I can’t hear the words.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Remember your manners, Bouchon, like the
Abbe says.</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: HELP ME! ABBE! SOMEONE… ANYONE… OH,
GOD…</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Madeleine… MADELEINE!!!</p>
<p><strong>cleante</strong>: Madeleine! Madeleine!</p>
<p><strong>franval</strong>: Madeleine! Madeleine! Madeleine!</p>
<p><strong>lunatics</strong>: Madeleine! Madeleine! Madeleine!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine –</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Maddy? Where are you now? Maddy?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine –</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: It’s her fault the Devil’s unleashed
himself upon us… it’s her fault…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine! Madeleine!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: MADELEINE!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: MADELEINE!</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Abbe? Is that you?… He means to kill me…
save me as you have before… I beg you… I’m sorry for all that I said…
please… oh, please…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Quickly now! Altogether men, as
one!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: QUICKLY! Before it reaches the
rafters on the upper floors –</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Maddy! Where are you, child?
Maddy!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Let me out your morons! Let me
loose!</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: Now, now. Don’t be shy. We’ve a nice
surprise just waiting for you…</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: That’s a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Of course, we mustn’t blame Bouchon;
he’s merely one of Nature’s experiments, gone awry. No discipline. No
conscience. No morality.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: IN FACT, IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROVIDE
THOSE THINGS ON HIS BEHALF. IS IT NOT?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: As you say, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: He was so impressed with the Marquis’
tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Perhaps you’ll be so kind as to
remind me of her name…</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I beg you, Doctor, don’t make me say
it.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: HER NAME, ABBE.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Madeleine.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: So tell me: when you’re called before
God, how will you answer for Madeleine’s death?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Murderer!</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Oh, I’m to be blamed now, am I?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Your words drove Bouchon to –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: For fuck’s sake, Abbe! What am I to do?
Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards
had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible?
I think not!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: An innocent child is dead.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: So many authors are denied the
gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I
not?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: It’s no secret that you loved her.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Oh, that’s rich – coming from her
lapdog –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I saw the longing in your eye –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: – that was lust –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: – the passion in your heart –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Don’t confuse one organ with another
–</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I know, because I felt it myself –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT’S ALL!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: AND DID YOU?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: IT’S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’re no stranger to rape, Marquis; and
yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Why was it you never took her by
force?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Who’s to say I did not?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Was it impotence?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: NEVER!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Then it must’ve been love –</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY
ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a
virgin.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Give her a proper burial. In the
churchyard, at my expense. Do not inter her sweet body in the same
ground as the devils who inhabit this accursed place.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Your terrible secret, revealed. You’re a
man, after all.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: All that remains now is your
punishment.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of
us will bleed?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Tomorrow, we’ll cut out your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>gaillon</strong>: I’ve opium to numb the pain.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Our intention here is punitive. If we numb
the pain, what’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Abbe de Coulmier!</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Surely you’ll grant me a final
word.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: Would that I were so easily
silenced.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: My, my. You have exceeded my
expectations.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: And my own.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: How is the patient faring?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Poorly.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: And you? It must’ve been an
ordeal.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’m not the first man God has asked to
shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Will you sleep soundly tonight?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to
sleep again.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: “In nomine patris et filii et spiritu
santu…”</p>
<p><strong>madeleine</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: Abbe! You’d best come quick.</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: He spat into his own filth. Made himself a
kind of paint.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Dear God.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Free his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: Mustn’t do that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I must grant him his last rites.</p>
<p><strong>valcour</strong>: I don’t take my orders from you; not
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: You’d deny a dying man his salvation?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Shhh… shhh… Dear Heavenly Father. Prove
Your infinite mercy, and open Your gates to this man, no less Your child
than any other.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: There is… in each of us… such beauty… and
such abomination. No… man… is… exempt.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Forgive him. Forgive us all.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: There now. Kiss the cross.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du
Maupas.</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: I’m pleased to have the new post,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: I’m afraid that our endowment has
shrivelled to a mere pittance; we’re the laughing stock of all France.
But – on a happier note –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: – the hospital is now in my sole
command.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Here each man must work for his
keep.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: The Charenton Press, Abbe.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: The compulsive inmates set the type
–</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: – and the listless ones do the
binding.</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: It’s remarkable, Doctor. The
patients are so subdued; so docile.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: They’ve the satisfaction only a hard
day’s labor can provide.</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: I don’t believe it. The Marquis de
Sade? You’re actually publishing his novels?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Ever since his unfortunate death,
there’s been a surge of interest in his work. I’ll use the profits to
restore Charenton to her former glory.</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Oh, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You’ve a meeting with Herr Becker at four
o’clock. He wants to publish a Swiss edition – on gilded paper, bound in
calfskin.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Thank-you, Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: My pleasure. Truly.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Have a look at page seventy-four;
I’ve turned the corner down…</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Of course, everything’s not as
harmonious as it seems. I hope you’ve a strong constitution.</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: My years tending the lepers at
St. Emilion steeled me for life’s grisliest offerings, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: We’ve still a few lone incurables.
Prone to violence, to perversion.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: So you’re my successor. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: My successor?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Listen to me, Abbe, and listen well.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: I’ve stared into the face of evil… …and
I’ve lived to tell the tale. Now… for your own sake… let me write it
down.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he
raves –</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Prove you’ve an ounce of Christian
charity… Bring me parchment… ink… and a quill.</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: You’ll do no such thing. This patient
poses a grave danger, to himself and to others.</p>
<p><strong>abbe du maupas</strong>: Are you all right, sir?</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: Don’t you see –</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Don’t you see, Abbe?</p>
<p><strong>royer-collard</strong>: Some men are past redemption.</p>
<p><strong>coulmier</strong>: A quill! A quill, goddamn you! A
QUILL!</p>
<p><strong>madame leclerc</strong>: Use it well; you owe her that.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Beloved Reader… I leave you now with a
tale penned by the Abbe de Coulmier, a man who found freedom in the
unlikliest of places. At the bottom of an inkwell; on the tip of a
quill.”</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: “Be forewarned: its plot is
bloodsoaked, its characters depraved and its themes unwholesome at best.
But in order to know virtue, we must acquaint ourselves with vice. Only
then can we know the full measure of man.</p>
<p><strong>the marquis</strong>: So come, I dare you… turn the
page…”</p>
