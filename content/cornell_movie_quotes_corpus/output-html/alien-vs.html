<h1 id="alien-vs">alien-vs</h1>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Ah, negative on that request commercial
freighter ‘Nan-Shan’. I’ve already got an inbound on that approach
pending a beacon-fix. Hold on my mark until I get back with some
confirmation. Rimward Traffic Control out.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: How’s it looking?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: That’s the second time I ran it, and it
still reads the same.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Better tell the boss.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Toss you for it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Fuck! Holo off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Noguchi.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What kind of ‘something’?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: You didn’t wipe your feet coming in.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Well, it’s okay. You didn’t tell me it was
monsoon season going out.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Hey, buenos dias, cowboy. When d’you blow
in?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Just got back. Missed anything?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Ahh, don’t pay any attention to Urioste.
She’s still pissed that Noguchi wouldn’t let her go off on your hunting
trip.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wasn’t my trip, I just did the driving.
’Sides, freezing my butt off out in the wet taking pot-shots at the
local wildlife isn’t my idea of a good time, either.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Where’d you leave them?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson’s
Range. They’re making their own way back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Shit. When?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Yesterday. We got the Network feed from
Gateway; it was the top story on ‘Sixty Seconds’. Biggest market crash
since twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Fucking great. I invested some money in
them.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: You win some, you loose some.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I lose ’em all, that’s why I’m still out here
on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: No, but I got something that might interest
you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’ve you got?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: A pair of incomings. They popped-up on the
medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly,
but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Yeah. Turns out they dropped straight out of
hyperspace.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Curious thing is, the mass detector says
they’re too small to carry a deep-space drive.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: That’s what we thought.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Have you got an updated Lloyds’ Almanac to
cross-reff them through?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Done it already. Nothing matches.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: And if you thought that was interesting,
watch this…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Yeah, exactly. Those’re pre-programmed
course adjustments you’re looking at.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Tactical nukes, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Where’re they headed?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We ran a trajectory simulation. If they
carry on along that path, it’s possible they’ll make intra-orbital
insertion.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know what to make of this. Get a
copy of the telemetry relayed back to Antarctica Traffic Control. Better
alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Fort Powell. What do we tell ’em?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Just give them the facts. They can leap to
their own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Little fuckers move too fast. Let’s do a
sweep and catch ’em on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Crazy idiots.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Ahhh, they’re just letting off some steam;
don’t let ’em get to you. Ackland and York aren’t such bad guys when you
get to know ’em. Just a couple of weekend warriors…</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Nice howitzer you’ve got there.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Good argument for gun-control. What are
you going after, rhino?</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Nah. I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.
’Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they’re
protected. They’ll dock you a month’s pay for just mentioning it.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Sure wish there was something on this planet
with a bit of fight in it, though.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten
away. Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers. The algae out
here just isn’t good on these new plastics.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We haven’t used Big Bertha since we
relocated the generator module. That was four months ago. I can’t ask
for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it’s already costing
too much as it is.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: If you want these things kept in working
condition, that’s the only choice you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Maybe she wouldn’t be so tetchy if she got
laid every once-in-a-while.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: You offering?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Nah. Freeze my dick off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know. I think we’ll have to run it
on a rota; one month down, one month operational.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Miss Noguchi! You’re wanted in admin.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Let me sort this out and we’ll go over the
logistics in my office.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Seven minutes ago, the third course change
in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications
platform just a little too close for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can we move it to a different orbit in
time?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Already working on it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and
put it on a repeater.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Looks like you were right. Someone’s lobbed
a pair of smart-missiles at us.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Relay station like us out in the middle of
the boonies; why bother? All you’re gonna do is punch a temporary hole
in the traffic control net. That’d be small potatoes even for
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Can you patch me a temporary loop on
DCMGS?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Okay, give me the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: They’ve changed their heading again.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Compensate!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Punch me in a solution for their
delta-vee.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: A three-second burn to port, on my
mark.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It’s on the board.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Picking up velocity.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Match it!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Not gonna make it…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We’ve lost the downlink. It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Shit! What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Meteor, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: D’you feel any impact shock?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Me either. I tell you, I used to be with a
mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits… believe
me, you know about it.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Do you wanna head back and call it in?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: That is the damndest impact I’ve ever
saw…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hey, boss. Wondered where you’d gotten
to.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I just… wanted to be put on my own for a
while. Clear my head.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Didn’t feel like whoopin’ it up with the rest
of us blue collars, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’ve got a lot of thinking to do. ’Sides,
the room was getting too crowded for me.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Not too much of the socializing type,
then?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No, not really. More sort of the
‘claustrophobic’ type.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m serious. That’s why I switched from
orbiting to planetary installations.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Is that a fact.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Uh-huh. Used to get it pretty bad. I’d wake
up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: How long you been out here for now, anyway?
Three months?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: And before that?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Six month stint on Datus.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Only six?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What is this? ‘Twenty Questions’?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Just curious. There’s a lot of talk goes
around.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I’ve just never found
anywhere I really felt at home.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Real man’ drink.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Seltzer?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ll stick with my own.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Any luck raising Ackland’s party?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Nothing. With the satellite down, we can’t
transmit over the mountain range. He’s most likely sitting there
wondering why he can’t raise us.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: First light, we’ll take a chopper out there
and tell them to head back.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: ‘We’? You wanna fly out there with me?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: This whole thing’s got me spooked.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t worry about it. If the Network goes by
the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from
Powell’ll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days. They can go poke
around out there and find whatever it was hit us. All we’ve gotta do is
sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do you think Ackland’ll sit tight?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: There’d have to be a helluva good reason for
him not to.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Found anything?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Nada. No radiation… no movement… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Well, just keep looking. It’s gotta be…
whoa, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s a rhino.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Is it dead?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: No, it’s still breathing. Kinda clammy
though. Are you sure your stick’s not broken.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Yeah, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: God, I hope that thing didn’t bring down a
virus.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I told you we… what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind,
maybe?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Bloody big if it is. Top’s open.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Careful…</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s hollow. Think our rhino must’ve ate
something that didn’t agree with him.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Let’s get back and call this in.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: What is that… is that metal fragments?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: This is very fucking weird.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s like something came out of the crater
and went that way…</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Another one?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah. This’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: …A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.
SOMETHING is watching them from the trees; something with a heat-vision
P.O.V. A PREDATOR. We see the flare of ACKLAND’s gunshots, then SNAP IN
to see the multi- colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a
purplish FACEHUGGER, before we…</p>
<p><strong>cut back to</strong>: …One of ACKLAND’s bullets taking a
meaty chunk out of YORK’s thigh as he races forward to help his friend.
The HUGGER’s tail is already around ACKLAND’s throat, it’s fingers
scrabbling for purchase. YORK pulls at one set of digits, and manages to
raise them for just an instant. What we see is horrific; the look of
terror on ACKLAND’s face, and the questing tendril on the HUGGER’s
underside trying to force it’s way between ACKLAND’s lips. In a second,
it’s all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK’s grasp, and clamps
itself firmly on ACKLAND’s face with a faint SUCKING SOUND. YORK
shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few feet away. He
watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving altogether.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the
color-bloom of YORK dragging ACKLAND’s body away from the crater. It
CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of
circulatory fluid pumping around the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: We’re looking at the site in
colours: the cold blue of empty ALIEN EGGS, and the warm reds of
just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the FACEHUGGER parasites.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: This time, an oscillating line
appears to the left of our view, and a band sweeps quickly ACROSS the
screen synchronous to us hearing different levels of SOUND STATIC. This
abruptly stops as the oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and
valleys. The PREDATOR is picking up radio waves. A HUMAN VOICE; albeit
grossly-distorted.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Jesus Christ! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Give me a hand with Ack.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: How bad is… oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Don’t… uuh… don’t know. Help me… uuh… help me
get him inside. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Have you tried prising it off?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I wanted to get him back here; get him back to
base.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Forget it. We lost the satellite link. It’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: We’ve got no option. We’re gonna have to
get it off.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Oh man…</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Get real, Beauvais! That thing might chew his
fucking face off for all be know!</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Minh…</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Yep…</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: How do you know it’s not already?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I don’t, but I think we should just wait and
let the Doc take a look…</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: Three humans; in motion and ‘hot’.
The triangular mechanism of the PREDATOR’s gun locks onto MINH.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The extraterrestrial hunter
scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on ACKLAND for a long moment, but
takes no further action.</p>
<p><strong>kamen’s p.o.v.</strong>: From out of the window of the
‘chopper’, we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking
on-and-off above the trees.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wake up. We’re at the beacon.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Looks like trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Used one of these before?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses
twelve mill hollow ‘O’ rounds, with through the barrel smart
laser-sighting. Sure, I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Okay. Watch were you point it…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah. Somebody won.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Check out the tent.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ve found Ackland!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jesus palomino…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wait a minute, Doc…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah. Found it curled up in a corner of the
tent. Any idea?</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Never come across one of these before. Maybe
the original survey team did. I’ll run it through records and see what
comes up.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check
out the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: She was running a little sluggish on the way
back. Think the turbines might be playing up.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Give me twenty minutes and I’ll do it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Where’re the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bagged and in the back. They’re not a pretty
sight.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the
towers and modules of the relay- station with great interest. An
oscillating red line appears to the LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR
analyses HIROKO’s voice-pattern.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: A newly decapitated ALIEN head is
turned around in another PREDATOR’s hands in admiration. This PREDATOR
thrusts his trophy onto the next spike, then stares at the vacant one
for a long moment. His wrist computer BLEEPS for attention…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m going to need you to co-sign the report.
Until we come up with something, this’ll be treated as first degree
murder.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: When we get the link back, and I send this
in, I.C.C.’ll throw a fit.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Ah, don’t worry about I.C.C. They’re the
least of your problems right now.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Sorry. Can I have a word?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sure. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago. The
algae must have clogged up an intake duct.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Think I spoke too soon…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Again? How long before we start noticing the
difference?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: I reckon it’ll be another day before the
smell gets unbearable. Beauvais usually fixes it, but… ah…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Sure, I can manage. But I’m not going into
the Pit on my own.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah, no problem. Ask Diller, he’s good with
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I’ll go along with that.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Parsons. Yeah. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Hey, c’mon Doc, I feel fine. Really.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Headache? Dehydration?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: The head’s okay, but I could sink a
six-pack.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Forget that. I want you off alcohol for at
least seventy-two hours. I’ve got some toxin build-up tests still to
run.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: He’s broken a fever that would kill a mule,
but if he says he’s alright I’m prepared to believe him. He’s all
yours.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What happened out there, Ack?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: We… watched a meteor hit over Linson’s.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: A meteor?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah, it impacted really off. We went out
to the crash-site… and… uh… that’s… that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Nothing else?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Show him ‘Fido’.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Ring any bells?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Not really, no. Ugly little sonuvabitch.
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: We thought you might be able to tell us. I
found it by your cot at the camp. You were out cold.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: What did York say?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: York’s vanished.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Vanished?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland. York’s
gone awol, unless you can help us go some way toward disproving our
suspicion, he’s the prime suspect right now.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Can I… um… have some water? Please?</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Do you believe him?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Ackland? I don’t know him well enough to
say. If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test
and find out for sure. There’s not much we can do out here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright then, For what it’s worth… yes, I
do.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You should try this seasoned stuff. It’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Got a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh, I’ve been looking for this! Where was
it?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: You left it in the chopper. Oh, and
before I forget, Don? I ran that test you wanted on the turbines.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: And, nothing. They checked out just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: What’s the matter, girl? You smell
something?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Rhinos look a little antsy,</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Yeah. Never seem ’em act like this
before.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: CASSIE and DILLER are ‘warm’, but
the rhinos are BREWSTER are ‘hotter’ still. Their VOICES and BREWSTER’s
BARKS are filtered to the point of unrecognizability, eerily
distorted.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: He looks in a bad way. Help me get him up to
Infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Holy Mary…</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The concealed hunter watches as
the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Oh. Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s nothing, Doc. Just a… touch of
indigestion… something.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Do you want a tablet?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: That sounds nasty. I’ll give you a couple of
Demazine.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Hold on, it’s alright. I’m gonna give you a
shot…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: York just turned up outside. We’re trying to
get him into Infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: The door’s sealed from inside. Doc Revna’s
in there, and it sounds like Ackland’s going nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Force the door.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Can’t. It’s pressure sealed.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get after it, don’t let it get away!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan, give me a hand over here.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: It left a melted trail on the deck all the
way down to here…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage
system. I found the grating ripped right off. The little fucker was
strong.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Where does that lead to?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Central Pumping. All the waste gets
treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp. If it wanted a
quick exit then it really lucked- out.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You’ve checked that end?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Not yet, no.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do it. I don’t want that thing on my
installation. I want it caught and destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Cornering it shouldn’t be a problem. Each
part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport
module running off external couplers. If we disconnect them and seal off
every section, we’ve got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal
power. That should give us ample time to find it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Pull some trackers and headsets out
of stores, and I’ll sign a release for the weapons. Cassie, organise a
team roster and put it on the board.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t care how you kill this thing, just
be careful not to get in it’s way when it bleeds. You all saw what
happened to Doc Revna.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Nobody wander off on their own until it’s
found. Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team’s done their sweep I
want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: One final point. Killing this sonuvabitch
ought to be a reward in itself. However, just to add a little incentive…
I’m authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever
does.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright, let’s get to it. New York rules
apply.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: …I mean, these… these mothers were… were huge.
They look like bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all
over ’em. They must’ve wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.
Minh got off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as
well have been using a B-B gun. I don’t know how the hell I made it out
of there alive.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved
that at me. Whatever it’s made of, it went straight through a
double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy composite like it was butter.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I don’t wanna ever come up against those
things again. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Yorkie. You’re safe
now. Go get come rest.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What do I think? I think if those Marines
from Powell don’t shift their butts getting here, we’re gonna get caught
up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: C’mon, man. One more sweep.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: One more sweep… one more sweep. I’m
getting tired of one more fuckin’ sweep. We’re been lookin’ for this
thing for three days now, and found zip.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey! I was in shape before we started
doing this.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Listen to that…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Listen to what?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s what I mean. This is the quietest
I’ve ever heard it. It’s unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: De Vries?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Next time you have a thought like that?
Keep it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Something spooking the rhinos?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The rhino’s, the dog, and the two
humans can be seen way above on the platform’s edge, bright red.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: What is that…is that it?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: No. I… think that’s a regulator valve. Hold
on.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Ah, got it…!</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Are you getting anything?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: They’re always like that. Head-Office are
real cheap when it comes to spares. Wave that thing in the corner…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: The room’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Give me a hand with this.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Pass me over that tripod, will you?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: That’s real peculiar behavior.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hey, Guttierez?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: One of ’em must have escaped.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s impossible, man. This fence is
high-tensile. The breaking tolerance’d stand up to the strain of a
rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: There’s no way a rhino’d survive that
drop.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Goldsmith’s gonna be plenty pissed at
losing one of her babies.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: That’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Whoa, wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Just got a reading…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Yeah, ‘Good Evening’ to you, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Today’s party’s finished their sweep, the
relief team’s out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running
shift in the auto-shop.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You should hit the sack, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Nah, I’ll stick it out for another hour or
so.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What time’s sundown?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: ’Bout five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Give me a yell is something happens.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: You got it, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s up there somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What? Are you nuts? Just the two of
us?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I’ve seen this mother, De Vries. We can
bag it, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Forget it, man.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: C’mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You
wouldn’t get me up there even if it wasn’t night.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey, fair enough. If you won’t come, I’ll
handle it myself.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Alright, okay. Look…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: But I’m going first…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Anything you say, Mammacitta.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Careful of that edging there…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Where’s that flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Still got him?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s moving slow. About… eleven metres.
On the left.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Little bit further…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there, right
behind the antennae. I think we’re got it cornered…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: The door to the food storage locker was
smashed open. It must have come straight out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If it got out of the systems, it could be
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hold it, hold it…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I’m picking up another signal.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Just behind us, over to the right.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Can’t see a thing. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, I…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Wait. Lost it.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I dunno. Might be a glitch.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Oh, man. That’s no glitch!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s alright, it’s cool…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Is it still moving?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: No, he’s stopped; he’s totally still.
Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Oh, nice going, man! It was a lemur! A
goddamn lemur!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Uh… sorry about that, boss. Everything’s
fine. False alarm, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hey, look; let’s forget it. There’s
nothing up here.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing
brightly. Her VOICE replayed and distorted.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: Nothing up here. Nothing up here.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: I’ve dropped my torch into the water. Give
me about… uh… a meter- and-a-half’s worth of slack.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Whoa, whoa…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: The hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The PREDATOR’s gaze SNAPS away
from the two humans and down onto the platform below. He watches the
infra-red shapes of other people running towards the source of the
shots…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Kev, wha…?</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: Gazing down at the platform, an
unseen hunter watches the swift black SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the
group of humans…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Move! Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get the door!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The PREDATOR’s speech analyser
plays back her vocal patterns as white- hot bullets sear the night.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: SNAPPING IN for a closer look at
her.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Come on, man. Leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Oh, God. Dear Lord Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: This is like a bad dream, man. A bad
fucking dream.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Rob? I want you to evac everybody from the
non-connective modules into admin. That goes double for anybody…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ll survive.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s with the dog?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey; c’mon now, girl. It’s alright. Let’s
just get this knot undone…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jan!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Get out of there, man!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Catch this!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Chew on this!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Get your ass out of here, boss!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: De Vries!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Inside, inside!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yo’ momma, boneface!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: From way up here, we’ve got an
outstanding view of the humans running across the platform…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’m out of ammo. Get inside, get inside!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: They’re in with the rhino!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: We’re moving swiftly along the
rooftops and surveying the melee below, lessening the distance with each
second…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: You got ’im!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Seal everything now!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Cassie, thank Christ! We’re under
attack.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’re what!?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: The son-of-bitches got into ‘E’ wing! They’re
ripping it apart!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Fuck! Somebody get over there with some
guns! Now!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: How many of them are there?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Too many.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Over there, on the right!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: These bastards ain’t so tough!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Is that thing working?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Shit! The casing’s cracked!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Use mine. Channel twenty-six.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hurry up and figure that thing out,
man!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: We’ve got company!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Shit, I’m dry! You’re up!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: I’m jammed!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You’re what?!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: It’s locked solid…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Quick, give me the clip!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Oh, Lord! Please, no! Not now!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Holo on!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: That’s the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Detour. Other way’s blocked…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: You got any slugs left?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: …Seven.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Try again, man…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Matt! Open these damn doors right now,
I’ll ream your ass so bad these things out here’ll seem like the Easter
Bunny in comparison! Swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Open the doors! Open the goddamned fucking
doors!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s it! We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Close it up, close it up!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hurry it up.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: They’re inside, inside the corridor!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Cassie…!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It you don’t… uh!… move your ass, you’re
gonna need a helluva diet to get through here!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Hurry up, we’re losing it!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Kamen!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: It’s going!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Miss Noguchi?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Miss Noguchi!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Everything on this module is locked and
sealed. We’ve lost ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘E’ wings, but ‘E’ was the only one we
didn’t manage to totally evacuate.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How many… how many people are missing?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far,
but the numbers are all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s our weapons situation?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Shit! Our armory’s a big blue box from the
back shelf of stores. We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Auto-shop?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Auto-shop’s sealed, but those boys are
cut-off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Has anybody talked to them?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Don’t panic, people. We’ve just switched
over to internals.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: They knocked out the external feeds.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Thirty six hours?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’re not gonna make it, are we?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get the auto-shop on-line.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Communications to auto-shop go through an
F.O. link off the main trunk. That’s down with the other feeds.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Well… try the headset.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, it’s impossible. Nothing can
grow and reproduce this fast.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah. Right. You wanna go outside and tell
them that?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s keeping those fucking Marines, man?
They should’a been here by now!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Maybe they ain’t coming. Maybe they don’t
even know we’ve got problems…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I don’t wanna hear that kind of crap,
Thomas. They’re coming. Just a matter of time, that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Yo! Guttierez!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Through now.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan, it’s Hiroko. What sort of shape are you
in down there?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Kamen didn’t make it, Jan.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can you make it back?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright, let’s keep calm. We’ve got to have
an option of some sort… there’s got to be a way out of this.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh yeah? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Well, what about those other things outside;
those warriors? Maybe we can cut some kind of deal…</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, it occurred to me that we could use the
overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.
That way we could put a bit of distance…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: That sounds promising. Can we operate the
crane from here?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Nah. It’s got programmable facilities, but
it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone’d have to go up to the
cab to get it up and running.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Which mean physically going outside.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Is this the suit?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: This is fuckin’ lunacy! You’re not gonna make
it across the platform on foot!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Shut up, York.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No, he’s right. Has anyone got a bike near
here?</p>
<p><strong>redheaded girl</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Let me have the keys.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>redheaded girl</strong>: Uh… the Hyundai racer. Yellow and
black stripes.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh, yeah. Real inconspicuous…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Listen, I don’t care if it’s pink and purple
polka-dots as long as it gets me there in one piece. Somebody loan me a
headset.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: No, go back. Second clasp from the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How much air-time have I got?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down
tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’ve dumped the whole data-base from one of
the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It’ll project the route through
the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and
hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too. That’s also on the
display.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: It’s not all good news. We had to take off
the helmet lights. You’ll be going in blind.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: We had to. They were just too cumbersome
for some of the conduits you’re gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all
the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt
having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.
Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How tight are these shafts?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Tight. We chose a route we felt would reduce
the chance of you running into any Aliens.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: There’s still time to back-out.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Forget it. I wouldn’t ask somebody to do
something I wouldn’t do myself. Where’s the disk?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Don’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Don’t worry. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Here. If you got to use ’em, make ’em
count.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Let’s just run through it one more time so
I know you’ve got it straight.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I pull the access panel off of the
console. Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sorry. Two green enabling buttons…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Right. When you’ve done that, don’t waste
any time getting out of there. Once that crane starts moving…well, it’s
bound to provoke some kind of response.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: You’ll need this for the gratings. Trigger
finger to operate, thumb button to switch over to the rivet gun. The
sensors’ll choose blade or socket heads automatically.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Right. Okay, I’m set.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Alright, let’s open her up. Carefully,
now…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: All clear…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: The pale illumination of the lower
level deck-lights gives way to absolute nothingness; a stygian
nightmare. She SHUDDERS with horror and pulls her head free.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh…! Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What? What’s wrong? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: It’s alright. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Seal it.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Suicide run, man. Fuckin’ suicide run.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks, Cassie.</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Okay. Back. Back. Little bit
more…</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Whoa…shit!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: She just set off!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, people. Let’s hustle…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: They’re comin’ up through the pit!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Over there!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mother-fucker!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You betcha.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Auto-shop.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Rob? We got problems.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: She finds herself in an upright
cylindrical chamber, about five feet in height. Massive extractor fans
churn dangerously where both the floor and ceiling ought to be. Kicking
up a swirl of particles. Pale blue light filters down from above.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Comin’ up the Central Reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading
off the auto-shop maintenance pit.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: …The chainsaw band might have punctured
his lungs.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I found it…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Drains right into the Central Reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Get her on-line. Now!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What was that? I don’t copy.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I can’t reach her. Too much signal
break-up.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: She’s inside the Central Reservoir,
a long cylindrical concrete tunnel some eighteen feet in diameter. The
water-level comes up about half- way. What fills the remainder freezes
her with revulsion…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I make it to the crane. You…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We copy, boss. Nice going.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Yeah, well don’t get too carried away; we’re
only halfway home. Talk…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Driscoll; you’re up.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I hear you…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Access panel… access panel…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, we’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Right. Auto-shop, you all set?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: One…mark!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I’m out of here!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Blow those suckers, Driscoll!</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Bolts blown!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yee-haa! Demolition derby, baby!</p>
<p><strong>predator vision.</strong>: Although the helmet’s nightsight
is malfunctioning, it’s still good enough to register the ‘hot’
infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hotter ’n hell out there!</p>
<p><strong>catwalk p.o.v.,</strong>: looking straight down. Four lasers
scan quickly around the module’s edges.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Okay, people. Hold on tight…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Take the wheel, Roy!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: C’mon, man! Let’s shag it!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Rob, it’s Hiroko. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Hiroko, it’s Cassie. What’s…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If I can get to the chopper, I’ll meet you
at the rendezvous. Don’t wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No ‘buts’. Just do it. Noguchi out.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Nice buns…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Move it baby, or they’re gonna be chewin’
on my cojones!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Couple more seconds!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s it! We’ve got it! Get us out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: C’mon sweetheart. Do your stuff…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Look. Don’t take this the wrong way, but
when I imagined the cavalry coming to my rescue… they never looked like
you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Broken. Useless!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jesus. I.C.C.’re gonna have to close the
book on this place.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on, Butch. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hey! I said come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: The PREDATOR wades through the
swamp towards something she cannot see. HIROKO looks around the
platform. She’s suddenly very alone.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You’ve got to be joking. No way am I going
back in there!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hiroko…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: They…they snapped my legs to fit… fit me in
here. I don’t…remember what happened next.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I can… feel it moving around inside me.
You’ve got to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I… I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You have to…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>schnick!</strong>: The wrist knives slice outwards. Red blood
SPATTERS HIROKO’s pale face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls
her away.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If you don’t move your ugly butt, we’re
gonna end up barbecued! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, Butch. I can play cavalry, too…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: C’mon! Jump!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: In the back! In the back!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Watch your shots! If you hit the engine
you’ll blow us both to hell!</p>
<p><strong>broken tusk</strong>: Chew…on…this…!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We’ve lost the starboard engine! We’re going
down! Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: Leaves, twigs, and branches rush
past as the heli-jet breaks through the canopy of foliage.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We’ve gotta get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hold on. This is gonna hurt some.</p>
<p><strong>broken tusk</strong>: Not…a pretty…sight…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Yeah. Why not.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Ah, negative on that request commercial
freighter ‘Nan-Shan’. I’ve already got an inbound on that approach
pending a beacon-fix. Hold on my mark until I get back with some
confirmation. Rimward Traffic Control out.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: How’s it looking?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: That’s the second time I ran it, and it
still reads the same.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Better tell the boss.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Toss you for it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Fuck! Holo off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Noguchi.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What kind of ‘something’?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: You didn’t wipe your feet coming in.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Well, it’s okay. You didn’t tell me it was
monsoon season going out.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Hey, buenos dias, cowboy. When d’you blow
in?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Just got back. Missed anything?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Ahh, don’t pay any attention to Urioste.
She’s still pissed that Noguchi wouldn’t let her go off on your hunting
trip.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wasn’t my trip, I just did the driving.
’Sides, freezing my butt off out in the wet taking pot-shots at the
local wildlife isn’t my idea of a good time, either.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Where’d you leave them?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson’s
Range. They’re making their own way back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Shit. When?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Yesterday. We got the Network feed from
Gateway; it was the top story on ‘Sixty Seconds’. Biggest market crash
since twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Fucking great. I invested some money in
them.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: You win some, you loose some.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I lose ’em all, that’s why I’m still out here
on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: No, but I got something that might interest
you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’ve you got?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: A pair of incomings. They popped-up on the
medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly,
but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Yeah. Turns out they dropped straight out of
hyperspace.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Curious thing is, the mass detector says
they’re too small to carry a deep-space drive.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: That’s what we thought.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Have you got an updated Lloyds’ Almanac to
cross-reff them through?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Done it already. Nothing matches.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: And if you thought that was interesting,
watch this…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Yeah, exactly. Those’re pre-programmed
course adjustments you’re looking at.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Tactical nukes, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Where’re they headed?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We ran a trajectory simulation. If they
carry on along that path, it’s possible they’ll make intra-orbital
insertion.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know what to make of this. Get a
copy of the telemetry relayed back to Antarctica Traffic Control. Better
alert the nearest RimCorp Base, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Fort Powell. What do we tell ’em?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Just give them the facts. They can leap to
their own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Little fuckers move too fast. Let’s do a
sweep and catch ’em on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Crazy idiots.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Ahhh, they’re just letting off some steam;
don’t let ’em get to you. Ackland and York aren’t such bad guys when you
get to know ’em. Just a couple of weekend warriors…</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Nice howitzer you’ve got there.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Good argument for gun-control. What are
you going after, rhino?</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Nah. I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.
’Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they’re
protected. They’ll dock you a month’s pay for just mentioning it.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Sure wish there was something on this planet
with a bit of fight in it, though.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten
away. Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers. The algae out
here just isn’t good on these new plastics.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We haven’t used Big Bertha since we
relocated the generator module. That was four months ago. I can’t ask
for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it’s already costing
too much as it is.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: If you want these things kept in working
condition, that’s the only choice you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Maybe she wouldn’t be so tetchy if she got
laid every once-in-a-while.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: You offering?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Nah. Freeze my dick off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know. I think we’ll have to run it
on a rota; one month down, one month operational.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Miss Noguchi! You’re wanted in admin.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Let me sort this out and we’ll go over the
logistics in my office.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Seven minutes ago, the third course change
in an hour. Those incomings are going to skim past the communications
platform just a little too close for comfort.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can we move it to a different orbit in
time?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Already working on it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and
put it on a repeater.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Looks like you were right. Someone’s lobbed
a pair of smart-missiles at us.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Relay station like us out in the middle of
the boonies; why bother? All you’re gonna do is punch a temporary hole
in the traffic control net. That’d be small potatoes even for
terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Can you patch me a temporary loop on
DCMGS?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Okay, give me the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: They’ve changed their heading again.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Compensate!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Punch me in a solution for their
delta-vee.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: A three-second burn to port, on my
mark.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It’s on the board.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Picking up velocity.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Match it!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Not gonna make it…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We’ve lost the downlink. It’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Shit! What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Meteor, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: D’you feel any impact shock?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Me either. I tell you, I used to be with a
mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits… believe
me, you know about it.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Do you wanna head back and call it in?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: That is the damndest impact I’ve ever
saw…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hey, boss. Wondered where you’d gotten
to.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I just… wanted to be put on my own for a
while. Clear my head.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Didn’t feel like whoopin’ it up with the rest
of us blue collars, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’ve got a lot of thinking to do. ’Sides,
the room was getting too crowded for me.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Not too much of the socializing type,
then?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No, not really. More sort of the
‘claustrophobic’ type.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m serious. That’s why I switched from
orbiting to planetary installations.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Is that a fact.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Uh-huh. Used to get it pretty bad. I’d wake
up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: How long you been out here for now, anyway?
Three months?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: And before that?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Six month stint on Datus.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Only six?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What is this? ‘Twenty Questions’?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Just curious. There’s a lot of talk goes
around.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I’ve just never found
anywhere I really felt at home.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Real man’ drink.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Seltzer?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ll stick with my own.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Any luck raising Ackland’s party?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Nothing. With the satellite down, we can’t
transmit over the mountain range. He’s most likely sitting there
wondering why he can’t raise us.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: First light, we’ll take a chopper out there
and tell them to head back.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: ‘We’? You wanna fly out there with me?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: This whole thing’s got me spooked.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t worry about it. If the Network goes by
the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from
Powell’ll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days. They can go poke
around out there and find whatever it was hit us. All we’ve gotta do is
sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do you think Ackland’ll sit tight?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: There’d have to be a helluva good reason for
him not to.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Found anything?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Nada. No radiation… no movement… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Well, just keep looking. It’s gotta be…
whoa, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s a rhino.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Is it dead?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: No, it’s still breathing. Kinda clammy
though. Are you sure your stick’s not broken.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Yeah, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: God, I hope that thing didn’t bring down a
virus.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I told you we… what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Looks like a spore. Fungus of some kind,
maybe?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Bloody big if it is. Top’s open.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Careful…</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s hollow. Think our rhino must’ve ate
something that didn’t agree with him.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Let’s get back and call this in.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: What is that… is that metal fragments?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: This is very fucking weird.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s like something came out of the crater
and went that way…</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Another one?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah. This’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: …A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING.
SOMETHING is watching them from the trees; something with a heat-vision
P.O.V. A PREDATOR. We see the flare of ACKLAND’s gunshots, then SNAP IN
to see the multi- colored from of his body toppling over, trailing a
purplish FACEHUGGER, before we…</p>
<p><strong>cut back to</strong>: …One of ACKLAND’s bullets taking a
meaty chunk out of YORK’s thigh as he races forward to help his friend.
The HUGGER’s tail is already around ACKLAND’s throat, it’s fingers
scrabbling for purchase. YORK pulls at one set of digits, and manages to
raise them for just an instant. What we see is horrific; the look of
terror on ACKLAND’s face, and the questing tendril on the HUGGER’s
underside trying to force it’s way between ACKLAND’s lips. In a second,
it’s all over; the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORK’s grasp, and clamps
itself firmly on ACKLAND’s face with a faint SUCKING SOUND. YORK
shivers, then uses his good leg to propel himself a few feet away. He
watches the hapless Teamster go rigid, then stop moving altogether.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh, God; oh, shit; oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT, watching the
color-bloom of YORK dragging ACKLAND’s body away from the crater. It
CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER, giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of
circulatory fluid pumping around the HUGGER and into ACKLAND.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: We’re looking at the site in
colours: the cold blue of empty ALIEN EGGS, and the warm reds of
just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the FACEHUGGER parasites.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: This time, an oscillating line
appears to the left of our view, and a band sweeps quickly ACROSS the
screen synchronous to us hearing different levels of SOUND STATIC. This
abruptly stops as the oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and
valleys. The PREDATOR is picking up radio waves. A HUMAN VOICE; albeit
grossly-distorted.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Jesus Christ! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Give me a hand with Ack.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: How bad is… oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Don’t… uuh… don’t know. Help me… uuh… help me
get him inside. Shit!</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Have you tried prising it off?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I wanted to get him back here; get him back to
base.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Forget it. We lost the satellite link. It’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: We’ve got no option. We’re gonna have to
get it off.</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Oh man…</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Get real, Beauvais! That thing might chew his
fucking face off for all be know!</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: Minh…</p>
<p><strong>minh</strong>: Yep…</p>
<p><strong>beauvais</strong>: How do you know it’s not already?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I don’t, but I think we should just wait and
let the Doc take a look…</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: Three humans; in motion and ‘hot’.
The triangular mechanism of the PREDATOR’s gun locks onto MINH.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The extraterrestrial hunter
scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on ACKLAND for a long moment, but
takes no further action.</p>
<p><strong>kamen’s p.o.v.</strong>: From out of the window of the
‘chopper’, we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking
on-and-off above the trees.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wake up. We’re at the beacon.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Looks like trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Used one of these before?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader. Uses
twelve mill hollow ‘O’ rounds, with through the barrel smart
laser-sighting. Sure, I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Okay. Watch were you point it…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah. Somebody won.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Check out the tent.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ve found Ackland!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hold on…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jesus palomino…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Wait a minute, Doc…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Is this it?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah. Found it curled up in a corner of the
tent. Any idea?</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Never come across one of these before. Maybe
the original survey team did. I’ll run it through records and see what
comes up.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hey, Jan. See if you can get someone to check
out the chopper.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: She was running a little sluggish on the way
back. Think the turbines might be playing up.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Give me twenty minutes and I’ll do it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Where’re the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bagged and in the back. They’re not a pretty
sight.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the
towers and modules of the relay- station with great interest. An
oscillating red line appears to the LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR
analyses HIROKO’s voice-pattern.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: A newly decapitated ALIEN head is
turned around in another PREDATOR’s hands in admiration. This PREDATOR
thrusts his trophy onto the next spike, then stares at the vacant one
for a long moment. His wrist computer BLEEPS for attention…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I’m going to need you to co-sign the report.
Until we come up with something, this’ll be treated as first degree
murder.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: When we get the link back, and I send this
in, I.C.C.’ll throw a fit.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Ah, don’t worry about I.C.C. They’re the
least of your problems right now.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Sorry. Can I have a word?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sure. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago. The
algae must have clogged up an intake duct.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Think I spoke too soon…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Again? How long before we start noticing the
difference?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: I reckon it’ll be another day before the
smell gets unbearable. Beauvais usually fixes it, but… ah…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Sure, I can manage. But I’m not going into
the Pit on my own.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Yeah, no problem. Ask Diller, he’s good with
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I’ll go along with that.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Parsons. Yeah. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Hey, c’mon Doc, I feel fine. Really.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Headache? Dehydration?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: The head’s okay, but I could sink a
six-pack.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Forget that. I want you off alcohol for at
least seventy-two hours. I’ve got some toxin build-up tests still to
run.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: He’s broken a fever that would kill a mule,
but if he says he’s alright I’m prepared to believe him. He’s all
yours.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What happened out there, Ack?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: We… watched a meteor hit over Linson’s.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: A meteor?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah, it impacted really off. We went out
to the crash-site… and… uh… that’s… that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Nothing else?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Show him ‘Fido’.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Ring any bells?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Not really, no. Ugly little sonuvabitch.
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: We thought you might be able to tell us. I
found it by your cot at the camp. You were out cold.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: What did York say?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: York’s vanished.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Vanished?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Beauvais and Minh are dead, Ackland. York’s
gone awol, unless you can help us go some way toward disproving our
suspicion, he’s the prime suspect right now.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Can I… um… have some water? Please?</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Do you believe him?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Ackland? I don’t know him well enough to
say. If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test
and find out for sure. There’s not much we can do out here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright then, For what it’s worth… yes, I
do.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You should try this seasoned stuff. It’s
good.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Got a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh, I’ve been looking for this! Where was
it?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: You left it in the chopper. Oh, and
before I forget, Don? I ran that test you wanted on the turbines.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: And, nothing. They checked out just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: What’s the matter, girl? You smell
something?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Rhinos look a little antsy,</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Yeah. Never seem ’em act like this
before.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: CASSIE and DILLER are ‘warm’, but
the rhinos are BREWSTER are ‘hotter’ still. Their VOICES and BREWSTER’s
BARKS are filtered to the point of unrecognizability, eerily
distorted.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: He looks in a bad way. Help me get him up to
Infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Holy Mary…</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The concealed hunter watches as
the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands.</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Oh. Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: It’s nothing, Doc. Just a… touch of
indigestion… something.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Do you want a tablet?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: That sounds nasty. I’ll give you a couple of
Demazine.</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Better?</p>
<p><strong>ackland</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>revna</strong>: Hold on, it’s alright. I’m gonna give you a
shot…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: York just turned up outside. We’re trying to
get him into Infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: The door’s sealed from inside. Doc Revna’s
in there, and it sounds like Ackland’s going nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Force the door.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Can’t. It’s pressure sealed.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Here…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get after it, don’t let it get away!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan, give me a hand over here.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: It left a melted trail on the deck all the
way down to here…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage
system. I found the grating ripped right off. The little fucker was
strong.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Where does that lead to?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Central Pumping. All the waste gets
treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp. If it wanted a
quick exit then it really lucked- out.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You’ve checked that end?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Not yet, no.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do it. I don’t want that thing on my
installation. I want it caught and destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Cornering it shouldn’t be a problem. Each
part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport
module running off external couplers. If we disconnect them and seal off
every section, we’ve got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal
power. That should give us ample time to find it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Pull some trackers and headsets out
of stores, and I’ll sign a release for the weapons. Cassie, organise a
team roster and put it on the board.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I don’t care how you kill this thing, just
be careful not to get in it’s way when it bleeds. You all saw what
happened to Doc Revna.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Nobody wander off on their own until it’s
found. Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team’s done their sweep I
want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: One final point. Killing this sonuvabitch
ought to be a reward in itself. However, just to add a little incentive…
I’m authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever
does.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright, let’s get to it. New York rules
apply.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: …I mean, these… these mothers were… were huge.
They look like bushmen, but they had all this hi-tech shit strapped all
over ’em. They must’ve wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds.
Minh got off a couple of shots from that cannon of his, but he might as
well have been using a B-B gun. I don’t know how the hell I made it out
of there alive.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: The one I clipped with the hoverbike shoved
that at me. Whatever it’s made of, it went straight through a
double-layer of honeycomb polyalloy composite like it was butter.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: I don’t wanna ever come up against those
things again. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Yorkie. You’re safe
now. Go get come rest.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What do I think? I think if those Marines
from Powell don’t shift their butts getting here, we’re gonna get caught
up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: C’mon, man. One more sweep.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: One more sweep… one more sweep. I’m
getting tired of one more fuckin’ sweep. We’re been lookin’ for this
thing for three days now, and found zip.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Ah, quit griping. Keeps you in shape
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey! I was in shape before we started
doing this.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Listen to that…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Listen to what?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s what I mean. This is the quietest
I’ve ever heard it. It’s unnatural.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: De Vries?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Next time you have a thought like that?
Keep it to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Something spooking the rhinos?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The rhino’s, the dog, and the two
humans can be seen way above on the platform’s edge, bright red.</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: What is that…is that it?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: No. I… think that’s a regulator valve. Hold
on.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Ah, got it…!</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Are you getting anything?</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: They’re always like that. Head-Office are
real cheap when it comes to spares. Wave that thing in the corner…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: The room’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Give me a hand with this.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Pass me over that tripod, will you?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: That’s real peculiar behavior.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hey, Guttierez?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: One of ’em must have escaped.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s impossible, man. This fence is
high-tensile. The breaking tolerance’d stand up to the strain of a
rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: There’s no way a rhino’d survive that
drop.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Goldsmith’s gonna be plenty pissed at
losing one of her babies.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: That’s a fact.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Whoa, wait a minute…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Just got a reading…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Yeah, ‘Good Evening’ to you, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Today’s party’s finished their sweep, the
relief team’s out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running
shift in the auto-shop.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You should hit the sack, too.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Nah, I’ll stick it out for another hour or
so.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: What time’s sundown?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: ’Bout five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Give me a yell is something happens.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: You got it, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s up there somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What? Are you nuts? Just the two of
us?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I’ve seen this mother, De Vries. We can
bag it, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Forget it, man.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: C’mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You
wouldn’t get me up there even if it wasn’t night.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey, fair enough. If you won’t come, I’ll
handle it myself.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Alright, okay. Look…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: But I’m going first…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Anything you say, Mammacitta.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Careful of that edging there…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, I got it.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Where’s that flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Still got him?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s moving slow. About… eleven metres.
On the left.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Little bit further…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there, right
behind the antennae. I think we’re got it cornered…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: The door to the food storage locker was
smashed open. It must have come straight out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If it got out of the systems, it could be
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hold it, hold it…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I’m picking up another signal.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Just behind us, over to the right.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Can’t see a thing. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah, I…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Wait. Lost it.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I dunno. Might be a glitch.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Oh, man. That’s no glitch!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: It’s alright, it’s cool…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Is it still moving?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: No, he’s stopped; he’s totally still.
Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Oh, nice going, man! It was a lemur! A
goddamn lemur!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Uh… sorry about that, boss. Everything’s
fine. False alarm, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hey, look; let’s forget it. There’s
nothing up here.</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: DE VRIES in CLOSE-UP, glowing
brightly. Her VOICE replayed and distorted.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: Nothing up here. Nothing up here.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: I’ve dropped my torch into the water. Give
me about… uh… a meter- and-a-half’s worth of slack.</p>
<p><strong>urioste</strong>: Whoa, whoa…</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>diller</strong>: Annie!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: The hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The PREDATOR’s gaze SNAPS away
from the two humans and down onto the platform below. He watches the
infra-red shapes of other people running towards the source of the
shots…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Kev, wha…?</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: Gazing down at the platform, an
unseen hunter watches the swift black SHAPE of the ALIEN in amongst the
group of humans…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Move! Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get the door!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: The PREDATOR’s speech analyser
plays back her vocal patterns as white- hot bullets sear the night.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: SNAPPING IN for a closer look at
her.</p>
<p><strong>predator</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Come on, man. Leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Oh, God. Dear Lord Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: This is like a bad dream, man. A bad
fucking dream.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Rob? I want you to evac everybody from the
non-connective modules into admin. That goes double for anybody…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’ll survive.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s with the dog?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Hey; c’mon now, girl. It’s alright. Let’s
just get this knot undone…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Jan!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Get out of there, man!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Catch this!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Chew on this!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Get your ass out of here, boss!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: De Vries!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Inside, inside!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yo’ momma, boneface!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: From way up here, we’ve got an
outstanding view of the humans running across the platform…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I’m out of ammo. Get inside, get inside!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: They’re in with the rhino!</p>
<p><strong>predator-vision.</strong>: We’re moving swiftly along the
rooftops and surveying the melee below, lessening the distance with each
second…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: You got ’im!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Seal everything now!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Cassie, thank Christ! We’re under
attack.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’re what!?</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: The son-of-bitches got into ‘E’ wing! They’re
ripping it apart!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Fuck! Somebody get over there with some
guns! Now!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: How many of them are there?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Too many.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Over there, on the right!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: These bastards ain’t so tough!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Is that thing working?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Shit! The casing’s cracked!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Use mine. Channel twenty-six.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hurry up and figure that thing out,
man!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: We’ve got company!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Shit, I’m dry! You’re up!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: I’m jammed!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: You’re what?!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: It’s locked solid…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Quick, give me the clip!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Oh, Lord! Please, no! Not now!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Holo on!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: That’s the wrong way!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Detour. Other way’s blocked…</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: You got any slugs left?</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Yeah. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: …Seven.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Try again, man…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Matt! Open these damn doors right now,
I’ll ream your ass so bad these things out here’ll seem like the Easter
Bunny in comparison! Swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Open the doors! Open the goddamned fucking
doors!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s it! We’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Close it up, close it up!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hurry it up.</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Don’t wait for me!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: They’re inside, inside the corridor!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Cassie…!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It you don’t… uh!… move your ass, you’re
gonna need a helluva diet to get through here!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Hurry up, we’re losing it!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Kamen!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: It’s too late!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: It’s going!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Miss Noguchi?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Miss Noguchi!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s the story?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Everything on this module is locked and
sealed. We’ve lost ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘E’ wings, but ‘E’ was the only one we
didn’t manage to totally evacuate.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How many… how many people are missing?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far,
but the numbers are all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s our weapons situation?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Shit! Our armory’s a big blue box from the
back shelf of stores. We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and
that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Auto-shop?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Auto-shop’s sealed, but those boys are
cut-off.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Has anybody talked to them?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Don’t panic, people. We’ve just switched
over to internals.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: They knocked out the external feeds.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Thirty six hours?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’re not gonna make it, are we?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Get the auto-shop on-line.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Communications to auto-shop go through an
F.O. link off the main trunk. That’s down with the other feeds.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Well… try the headset.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, it’s impossible. Nothing can
grow and reproduce this fast.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Yeah. Right. You wanna go outside and tell
them that?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: What’s keeping those fucking Marines, man?
They should’a been here by now!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Maybe they ain’t coming. Maybe they don’t
even know we’ve got problems…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: I don’t wanna hear that kind of crap,
Thomas. They’re coming. Just a matter of time, that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Yo! Guttierez!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Through now.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan, it’s Hiroko. What sort of shape are you
in down there?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Kamen didn’t make it, Jan.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jan?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Can you make it back?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright, let’s keep calm. We’ve got to have
an option of some sort… there’s got to be a way out of this.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh yeah? Like what?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Well, what about those other things outside;
those warriors? Maybe we can cut some kind of deal…</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, it occurred to me that we could use the
overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.
That way we could put a bit of distance…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: That sounds promising. Can we operate the
crane from here?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Nah. It’s got programmable facilities, but
it was never rigged for remote operation. Someone’d have to go up to the
cab to get it up and running.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Which mean physically going outside.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Is this the suit?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: This is fuckin’ lunacy! You’re not gonna make
it across the platform on foot!</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Shut up, York.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No, he’s right. Has anyone got a bike near
here?</p>
<p><strong>redheaded girl</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Let me have the keys.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>redheaded girl</strong>: Uh… the Hyundai racer. Yellow and
black stripes.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Oh, yeah. Real inconspicuous…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Listen, I don’t care if it’s pink and purple
polka-dots as long as it gets me there in one piece. Somebody loan me a
headset.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: No, go back. Second clasp from the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How much air-time have I got?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: About thirty minutes. Those are slimmed-down
tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: We’ve dumped the whole data-base from one of
the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It’ll project the route through
the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and
hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too. That’s also on the
display.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: It’s not all good news. We had to take off
the helmet lights. You’ll be going in blind.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: We had to. They were just too cumbersome
for some of the conduits you’re gonna have to negotiate. Besides, all
the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt
having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.
Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: How tight are these shafts?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Tight. We chose a route we felt would reduce
the chance of you running into any Aliens.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: There’s still time to back-out.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Forget it. I wouldn’t ask somebody to do
something I wouldn’t do myself. Where’s the disk?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Don’t lose it.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Don’t worry. I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Here. If you got to use ’em, make ’em
count.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Let’s just run through it one more time so
I know you’ve got it straight.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I pull the access panel off of the
console. Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Sorry. Two green enabling buttons…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Right. When you’ve done that, don’t waste
any time getting out of there. Once that crane starts moving…well, it’s
bound to provoke some kind of response.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: You’ll need this for the gratings. Trigger
finger to operate, thumb button to switch over to the rivet gun. The
sensors’ll choose blade or socket heads automatically.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Right. Okay, I’m set.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Alright, let’s open her up. Carefully,
now…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: All clear…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: The pale illumination of the lower
level deck-lights gives way to absolute nothingness; a stygian
nightmare. She SHUDDERS with horror and pulls her head free.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Oh…! Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What? What’s wrong? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: It’s alright. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Seal it.</p>
<p><strong>york</strong>: Suicide run, man. Fuckin’ suicide run.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Thanks, Cassie.</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Okay. Back. Back. Little bit
more…</p>
<p><strong>grease monkey</strong>: Whoa…shit!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: She just set off!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, people. Let’s hustle…</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: They’re comin’ up through the pit!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Over there!</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Mother-fucker!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You betcha.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Auto-shop.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Rob? We got problems.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: She finds herself in an upright
cylindrical chamber, about five feet in height. Massive extractor fans
churn dangerously where both the floor and ceiling ought to be. Kicking
up a swirl of particles. Pale blue light filters down from above.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Comin’ up the Central Reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Quick! Run a trace on the culvert leading
off the auto-shop maintenance pit.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: …The chainsaw band might have punctured
his lungs.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I found it…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Drains right into the Central Reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Get her on-line. Now!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What was that? I don’t copy.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: I can’t reach her. Too much signal
break-up.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: She’s inside the Central Reservoir,
a long cylindrical concrete tunnel some eighteen feet in diameter. The
water-level comes up about half- way. What fills the remainder freezes
her with revulsion…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I make it to the crane. You…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: We copy, boss. Nice going.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Yeah, well don’t get too carried away; we’re
only halfway home. Talk…</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Driscoll; you’re up.</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: I hear you…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Access panel… access panel…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, we’re in business.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Right. Auto-shop, you all set?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Alright. Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: One…mark!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, I’m out of here!</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Blow those suckers, Driscoll!</p>
<p><strong>driscoll</strong>: Bolts blown!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yee-haa! Demolition derby, baby!</p>
<p><strong>predator vision.</strong>: Although the helmet’s nightsight
is malfunctioning, it’s still good enough to register the ‘hot’
infra-red shape of HIROKO on the catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Hotter ’n hell out there!</p>
<p><strong>catwalk p.o.v.,</strong>: looking straight down. Four lasers
scan quickly around the module’s edges.</p>
<p><strong>parsons</strong>: Okay, people. Hold on tight…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Take the wheel, Roy!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: C’mon, man! Let’s shag it!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Rob, it’s Hiroko. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: Hiroko, it’s Cassie. What’s…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If I can get to the chopper, I’ll meet you
at the rendezvous. Don’t wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>cassie</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No ‘buts’. Just do it. Noguchi out.</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Nice buns…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Can you handle it?</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Move it baby, or they’re gonna be chewin’
on my cojones!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: Couple more seconds!</p>
<p><strong>de vries</strong>: That’s it! We’ve got it! Get us out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: C’mon sweetheart. Do your stuff…</p>
<p><strong>guttierez</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Look. Don’t take this the wrong way, but
when I imagined the cavalry coming to my rescue… they never looked like
you.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Broken. Useless!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Jesus. I.C.C.’re gonna have to close the
book on this place.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on, Butch. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hey! I said come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: The PREDATOR wades through the
swamp towards something she cannot see. HIROKO looks around the
platform. She’s suddenly very alone.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: You’ve got to be joking. No way am I going
back in there!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: Hiroko…</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: They…they snapped my legs to fit… fit me in
here. I don’t…remember what happened next.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: I can… feel it moving around inside me.
You’ve got to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: I… I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>kamen</strong>: You have to…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>schnick!</strong>: The wrist knives slice outwards. Red blood
SPATTERS HIROKO’s pale face. BROKEN TUSK grabs her arm roughly and pulls
her away.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Come on! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: If you don’t move your ugly butt, we’re
gonna end up barbecued! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Okay, Butch. I can play cavalry, too…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: C’mon! Jump!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: In the back! In the back!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Watch your shots! If you hit the engine
you’ll blow us both to hell!</p>
<p><strong>broken tusk</strong>: Chew…on…this…!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We’ve lost the starboard engine! We’re going
down! Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>hiroko’s p.o.v.</strong>: Leaves, twigs, and branches rush
past as the heli-jet breaks through the canopy of foliage.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: We’ve gotta get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Hold on. This is gonna hurt some.</p>
<p><strong>broken tusk</strong>: Not…a pretty…sight…</p>
<p><strong>hiroko</strong>: Yeah. Why not.</p>
