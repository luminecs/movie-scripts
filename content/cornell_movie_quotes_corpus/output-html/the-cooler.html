<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>player in f.g.</strong>: Don’t you hold back, baby. Spit it
out, darlin’. C’mon… Hey! Hey, this ain’t right. S’posed to be eight
hundred dollars. Where’s the goddamn manager? Who’s in charge of these
rip-off slots? Yo, ma’am… change lady…</p>
<p><strong>figure/bernie</strong>: Hey Doris, you got any cream?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Shit. Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hi, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hi. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yeah, Bernie. Hey, you seen Shelly around?
He promised to position me at the tables tonight. I’ve been on skid row
all week.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: You didn’t settle me from last night.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No? You sure? Fuck… And I was way under.
It’s been, like, an A.A. convention the whole week. I’ll make up for it
tonight. Promise.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If I see Shelly, I’ll let him know. That
you’re looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Bitch. That’s the third time this month… Let
me get you that cream.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nah, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>doris</strong>: Don’t get sweet on that, Bernie. Not unless
you’re looking to get short- changed.</p>
<p><strong>floorman</strong>: Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on
eleven.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Uh… Let’s do the Chivas Regal. Have that…
Natalie bring it over. The one working nickel slots next to the
Paradise. I spoke to Shelly earlier, he wants her at the tables.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: This is you, right?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Joe said I should stick around. You say
something to Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: I’ll make you a fortune on five and nine.
C’mon forty-five-sixty-three fifty-four!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, buddy, is this your drink?</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: Back off, pal. I’m on a roll here.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Seven out!</p>
<p><strong>bulldog</strong>: Mother-fucker!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Thank you for those bets, folks.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Conway, party of twelve, please check your
reservation at the Paradise Lounge.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I’m comin’…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn’t know
you were coming in…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Whassimater? You think I don’t wash up after
goin’ to the John? Forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You shoulda called ahead. I woulda sent a
car…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Ehh. We thought we’d surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Shelly, I want you to meet one of our
smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: How do you do, Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What can I get you boys to drink?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: So… what brings you to town, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Look, Shelly, this is your joint, you run it
the way you see fit. But we got a smart kid here and he’s got some good
ideas on how to revitalize the Shangri-la.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Revitalize? What are you talking about? We
did thirty-five million last year.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: First off, Shelly, I want you to know, I have
nothing but respect for you. You’ve done a fantastic job with the
Shangri-la for the last sixteen years. No one would dispute that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: But, the business has changed out here. You
just have to take a look at the Strip to see what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You mean, that amusement park mook fest out
there? You know what that is? That’s a fucking violation of something
that used to be beautiful. That used to have class. Like a gorgeous high
priced hooker with an exclusive clientele. And then that Steve Wynn
cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Now she’s nothing but a cheap, fat whore
hiding behind too much makeup. I look at her and see all those ugly
stretch marks and I want to cry. ’Cause I remember her as she was.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yes, well… there’s no denying the bottom
line. Those eyesores are raking it in. And we can’t compete against
that.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What? You think I’m trying to compete with
that? You think this joint’s about bringing in the stroller crowd? Fresh
off some fucking E-ticket ride, looking to break the house on red and
black. Fremont’s never been about that bullshit. This is where old time
and real money comes to play.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: The numbers, they don’t back you up, Shelly.
Nostalgia’s grand. We all love nostalgia – but it belongs in a museum. I
think it’s time to decide whether you’re running a museum or a
casino.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, forget about it. We’ll talk later. Over
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: So, how’s the action?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I was just heading over to –</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It can wait.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How’s the knee?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I was speaking to this orthopedic surgeon
over at Vegas Memorial. He tells me they can replace a man’s entire
kneecap with titanium. It’s the kinda thing that costs a shitload, but
since the man’s into us for five hundred large, I’m sure we could –</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I told you, I’m not gonna be around after
Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where the fuck
are you gonna go that’s better’n here? I got you covered in this town.
People, they know you work for me, that’s currency in your pocket.
That’s fuckin’ respect when you walk the floor. Where you gonna get that
anyplace else?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and I’m out
from under.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s right. I like to know who’s shopping
it in my neighborhood. You wanna keep working the Shangri-la, you come
see me tomorrow morning in my office. We’ll go over the rules together.
And before you come, you bring me a clean bill of health. OK?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: All right, get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You want that, Bernie? She’s yours. Anytime.
I’ll keep a tab running for you. What’s a matter? Not your type?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Things are getting hot on fourteen. I gotta
go.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: …Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh yeah,
that’s the spot… Do it to me harder, you big stud… Oooooh…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Seven and Seven?</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Thanks, dollface.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh shit… Sorry… I’m such a klutz.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It’s all right. Happens.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Sorry, this guy… fuckin’ hands, you
know…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: S’okay. You might want to stick around.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have no hard
eight.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Eight the hard way!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Parlay! Parlay!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: C’mon. You can take that action.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: That’s what I’m talking about. None of
this low limit bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Dollar hard eight.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight comes
down.</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Five hundred dollar hard eight. And press
my nine up two units.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Easy way eight! Eight easy!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: Hard eight.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Seven out!</p>
<p><strong>pinkerton</strong>: What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment
tonight. I shouldn’a let you talk me into going on. It’s definitely
strep.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You were velvet out there, pops. Silk.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They were hanging on the door outside.
Forget your tonsils. When the muff confetti stops coming, that’s when
you got yourself a problem.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You get a receipt?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Charmayne’s in the lobby. They got these on
sale in the window. Victoria Secret’s Valentine’s Collection. And the
broad waiting in the room, what she set you back? Always Grade-A for Ol’
Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Are you kidding me? Gimme that. You don’t
fucking deserve this. All those ladies going home with a sweet breeze
between their legs because you still do it for them and you’re fingering
me for some kinda Buddy Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you, old man.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Get back here, you prick. Hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Whassimatter, kid? You got that Nostradamus
look.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: You ever watch those nature shows on</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: I’ve seen this one a dozen times. It’s about
lions. Cycle of life thing. The leader of the pack…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Pride. It’s called a pride.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah, pride. The leader of the pride… when he
gets on in years. It’s just a matter of time before some young male
arrives on the scene to challenge him. They go at it and the old cat
gets the crap beaten outta him. It’s humiliating. In front of all the
females, this goes down. And after he’s defeated, he’s cast out of the
pride, to scavenge and die alone in the bush.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah, nature’s got a real sick sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: No shit. It’s fucking tragic because the old
lion can’t figure it out on his own. That he’s past it. It’d be so much
easier for him to just walk away and save himself all that pain and
humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s like admitting to yourself that
you’re already dead. I prefer nature’s way.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yeah. Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shelly, got a minute…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How ya doin’, Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I know you from somewhere, right?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Johnny’s been opening for Danny Ganz at the
Mirage. Sony’s talking about signing him to a three album deal. They’re
positioning him as the new Ricki Martin.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: And I should be interested in this, why?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Johnny’s looking to headline. I told him we
might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, if this is a bad time…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Even if I were interested, Buddy’s got ink
with us through 2003. I just renegotiated his contract last year.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sounds like the two of you need to get on
the same page. If I don’t hear from you by Thursday, I’m taking the
Stardust’s offer.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Where’s Buddy? I wanna buy the old fart a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Buddy asked me to send you his regards,
Nicky. He’s not feeling so great. I think he’s got that stomach flu
that’s going around.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh yeah? That’s too bad. Well, another time
then.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be able to
hook us up with some showgirls. Something with class.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Sure, no problem. You got any
preferences?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah. Something with big headlights, nice
rims and low mileage.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: You got any Asian babes?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I think I’ll just stick with the tables.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 12.5
Degrees, and is in Direct motion. Which tells me that you’re a slow
starter when it comes to romance. You know what? This is real
unprofessional of me. I shouldn’t discuss your chart with you until I’m
all done. I can tell by that look, you think this is all a lot of</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: No… I just know what the outcome’s going to
be.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: The outcome? There’s not, like, one
particular outcome. A lot of things enter into it. The planets, moon
phases…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The outcome won’t change with me. It’ll be
all bad.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: God, I have never met anyone who was so
down on themselves. I used to be down on myself, OK? I don’t go there
anymore. I’ve got just three more correspondence classes with this
stuff, then I’ll have my certificate and everything. And you know how I
got OK?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You had your chart done.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yes, as a matter of fact that is perfectly
correct.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Do you know what I do at the Shangri-
la?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I asked around. You’re a “cooler.” You turn
winners into losers.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: And do you know how I do that?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I know there’s stuff that goes on in
casinos all the time –</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I do it by being myself. People get next to
me and their luck turns. It’s always been that way.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That sounds to me like a self fulfilling
prophecy. There’s a whole chapter on that in my course. Anyways, I can
see a big factor in your life is that you’re lacking companionship.
There’s nobody to deflect off. If you’ve got, as you put it, bad karma,
then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it. Well, that’s my
take on it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t know about you, but I’m real
tired.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I have this recurring dream where I’m on
some beautiful island in the Bahamas. I’m sitting on the beach, taking
in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand …and then it starts
to rain. And I wake up and it’s my roof leaking on me. Yeah, I’m also
real tired, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: he’s telling her</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Only five more days? Then we shouldn’t
waste any more time.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Why don’t we go back to your place?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I, uh… If this is… I don’t know… I don’t
know if I can afford…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh god… I’m so sorry… I didn’t mean… You see
– that’s exactly what I’m talking about. I’ve gone and “cooled” the damn
table.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven’t gone
and cooled anything. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You should complain about this.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m not here that much. Drink? Sorry, all I
got’s gin.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Nah. I’ve had my fill. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You know, once they’re dead, they don’t
really grow back. In case, that’s what you’re waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: So… got any music?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least one of
us has done this before.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This is not my first –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Sssh. Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You’re doing real good.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Don’t worry, Bernie. I’ve had worse. We’ll
try again later.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: – I did six months at Rikers for running
numbers. It was Shelly’s thing, but I took the rap for it.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: After I get out, I call up Shelly and he
tells me to come out here. I figure he’s going to set me up good at the
Shangri-la. But he tells me they got all these rules about casinos
employing felons. So he gets me this gig doing telemarketing for one of
their fronts – trying to scam pensioners out of their retirement money.
I lasted two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Already, I was getting in deep. Finally it
got so bad, I had to beg Shelly to take on my markers around town. That
just bought me more time to keep losing. I put Shelly in an awkward
position. I understand why he did what he did.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: He did that to you? What, he shot you?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Baseball bat. I got off easy.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That’s getting off easy?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I was out of control.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: But he maimed you…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Let me tell you something. I’m grateful for
what he did. No kidding. Every time I get an urge to play off the clock
– to so much as drop a quarter in a slot – I reach down and squeeze
what’s left of my cartilage. It’s one helluva reminder.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Jesus… I thought stuff like that didn’t
happen no more. Like that was just in the movies or something.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a payment
plan. Two years off the books at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. Five
more days and I walk.</p>
<p><strong>pregnant girl</strong>: Oh shit, I think I’m going into
labor!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Bernie…</p>
<p><strong>pregnant girl</strong>: I’m OK now. False alarm. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Mikey? Is that…? You’re not the…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Bull’s eye. One time. Obviously runs in the
family. I guess you’re gonna be a grandfather, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This you?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, we
gotta be somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: How’s your mom doing?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I’m gonna pretend like you give a shit and
tell you, she’s getting by. As long as she’s wasted.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Name’s Charlene, in case you were wondering.
Looks like she’s carrying a whole litter in there, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: When was the last time you saw a
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six months
ago. I wasn’t about to go back after they treated me like cattle. Just
because I didn’t have no insurance. And those places, they’re crawling
with T.B. from all ’em spies.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: So, you’re in town…?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Maybe a week or so. Got some business to take
care of.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If you want, stop by the Lucky Star Motel.
Give us a chance to catch up. I’m on three to eleven shift at the
Shangri-la. I work the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: No shit. Well, how ’bout that? Yeah, maybe
I’ll do that. We can play catch up. For the kid’s sake. Gotta split.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Money plays one hundred.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: No offense, pal, but there’s twenty other
tables. What do you wanna come sit on my head for?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Just wanna play one hand. Feeling lucky
tonight. I got this voice in my head, says this is the table…</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: I know this is the table. I’m already doing
good here. It’s my fucking table –</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hey, heard the one about the fella walks
into a bar and says, “Hey, who owns that big great dane outside?” A man
at the end of the bar raises his hand. “I do.” The fella says, “Yeah?
Well, my dog just killed it.”</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: “Whaddya mean your dog just killed my great
dane? What kinda dog you have?” The fella just shrugs and says, “A
chihuahua.” “You tellin’ me your chihuahua just killed my great dane?
How?” “I dunno,” the fella says, “I think he got stuck in his
throat.”</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: God damnit!</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: You said, one hand.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, we make
a great team.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, what fucking gives? Is it McGann? He’s
been with us twelve years. The man’s as standup as my dick. Maybe he’s
got money problems. I’m gonna pull him. He wasn’t counting ’em, was he?
The mook with the streak?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No, there’s no problem. Fella’s on a streak,
is all.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Let me guess? This is one of your
“coolers?”</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Why don’t you announce it to the whole
fucking joint?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Man, they told me you were a stickler for the
old ways. But coolers? What is this guy, some kind of degenerate
gambler? Reformed card shark? He doesn’t look too effective to me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: He’s the best. Take it from me.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Sure. Whatever. But there ways – subtle ways
– to keep things in our favor. I’m talking more forward thinking
methods.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That right? I suppose you got a whole
fucking prospectus on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: As a matter of fact I do. Like, right off the
bat, I can tell you this wallpaper isn’t going to cut it. It’s too
uplifting. I would go with more muted tones.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah? Wallpaper?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: And personally, I think the waitresses can
all pop another button or two. Myself, I wouldn’t hire anything less
than a C cup.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Know what this is? Music to be sure.
Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra.
“Lose… lose… lose.” And that’s just skimming the surface. We really need
to talk, Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Shelly, you better come quick.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Get a hold of his daughter. Assist her with
the arrangements. The Shangri- la will take care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What about the Paradise?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: She goes dark tonight.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: That won’t be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>ring toss worker</strong>: Over here, young lady! C’mon, give
it a try. Eight for a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>ring toss worker</strong>: Sorry there, sweetheart. Better
luck next time. Wanna try again?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nothing. You’re just an easy mark, is
all.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: An easy mark?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard that
term?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: When we were kids, Shelly and me, we used to
work Coney Island during the summer. When a guy would walk up and seemed
eager to open his wallet, we would always mark him with chalk. We’d pat
him on the back or arm with the chalk. Like, ‘Hey buddy, good job!’
Meanwhile, he had no clue the other guys saw him coming a mile away.
Easy mark.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You notice last night, that tattoo on my
butt?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Little Joe.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I had a son. His name was Joe. I was his
mother for a year.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You know, you don’t have to tell me
this.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I want to, Bernie. Better you know the
worst of me up front. Later, when I’m already invested in you, it’ll be
too hard to come clean. After I tell you this, you’ll probably… I mean,
I’ll understand.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I gave my son up for adoption. I just
wanted my life back. I was seventeen going on eighteen and I was
selfish. My family, they didn’t want to have nothing to do with me after
that. So I hitched a ride out here. Figured I could make it as a
showgirl. Ten years later… I like to think that if it happened when I
was older – with some guy I cared about – maybe things would have been
different. I think about my Little Joe. And, I do know he’s better off.
I’m convinced of that.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: So, you wanna go try your hand at the dime
pitch? It’s early still.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: I gotta go pee. I’m always peeing.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: How did you get in here?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I told the desk clerk Bernie was my old man.
He let us wait inside. That a problem?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie’s looking for a parking space.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Shit. I musta taken the last one.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Tell me something, Natalie? Is he paying
you?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: My old man, is he renting your ass? ’Cause
otherwise I just don’t get it. A loser like my pops in the company of
some primo T &amp; A. It don’t compute.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: This enough to get me a taste? Family
discount?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Mikey…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna stop
by.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah… I figured you’d call ahead. We were
out at breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You missed some.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You see, the thing is, Bernie, we’re kinda
strapped. I mean, Charly here’s expecting like yesterday, and we don’t
have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an’ all. So, I
was wondering if you would care to invest a little in your grandchild’s
future… his well being.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: There’s about three grand there. That’s all
I got.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Bless you, Bernie. You know, Michael, I –
think we should name her Bernadette. After your father.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it’s a boy.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Wanna feel her?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t think… I don’t want anything to
hap…</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Ooh, I just felt her kick. C’mon, Bernie,
gimme your hand…</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Feel that?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t know… I think so…</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: We’ll catch you later, Bernie. I think I’m
gonna take Charly over to the hospital right now. Get her checked up
real good.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Take care, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Mikey…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You’re not going to try anything stupid
while you’re in town?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You mess up and they’ll cut you no slack.
That’s all I’m saying. You got a kid to think about.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Shelly, I hope you don’t mind…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What’s going on, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m sorry we didn’t say nothing about this
earlier… but the deal wasn’t closed yet.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Don’t worry, Shelly, you’re gonna love
it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino. We break
ground on her in six months.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I know what you’re thinking? Where’s she
gonna go? You need space to expand, right? Well, that’s been taken care
of. We’re now the proud owners of The Golden Frontier next door.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: She’s perfect. Three floors of gaming, IMAX
theater, entertainment center, boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster,
you name it. She’ll pay for herself in three years, and then it’s easy
money.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Isn’t she great, Shell?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: In “Lost Horizon,” these people, their plane
crashes in the Himalayas – and they get rescued and taken to this Utopia
in the mountains. Shangri- la. It’s beautiful. The place is completely
isolated. Untouched by the outside world. There’s no war, no greed, no
bullshit… Time is slowed down. People, they don’t age. It’s… paradise.
That’s what Shangri- la is. Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Yeah, we’ve all seen the movie. And your
point is?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You don’t fuck with paradise! All’a ya!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, Jesus, c’mon, Shelly. We’re not trying
to fuck with it. We’re trying to make it better.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How… how, Nicky, could it be any better?
Right now it’s perfect. It’s the last of its kind. It’s pure… and this.
…this is just… it’s a mockery. An insult. Trying to make something of it
that it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What are you talking about? It’s right outta
the movie?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Whose talking about a fuckin’ movie? This
ain’t a fuckin’ movie. This is my life. This is my house of worship. You
people are shittin’ on all that’s sacred to me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I got just one question? Where you gonna be
when they decide to change it back? When the people, they come looking
for the real Vegas, from before all this Epcott Center bullshit. Who’s
gonna it give it to them? You guys? I don’t think so. You know who? The
same fucks who started this shit in the first place. It’s all gonna come
full circle and bite you in the ass. Mark my words.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You make some good points, Shelly. Maybe
it’ll swing back the other way, who knows? But the smart money suggests
we roll the dice. I’m not gonna bullshit you; naturally there’s gonna be
a lot of restructuring in the months to come, but I want you to know,
you’ll always have a place with us.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Where’s that? Behind the bar?</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Behind the bar, that’s a good one.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I think you should take some time and think
things through. All this, it’s a lot to digest, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: Speaking of things to digest, I’m starving.
How’s that buffet they got in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You recommend
their prime rib, Shell?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s food.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, my arteries can use a workout. Lead us
to the trough, Shell.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Wait up a second…</p>
<p><strong>marty</strong>: I thought we were gonna eat?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Maybe we wanna play over there. Less
crowded.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Nah, let’s play here. This is my lucky table.
I always play here. Go on ahead. I know where to find you guys.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Out! Seven, line away seven…</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: C”mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda
paid my mortgage with the money I just lost.</p>
<p><strong>shooter</strong>: Hey? I’m supposed to be next…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: File a grievance, shithead.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: We’re coming out. Crap Eleven, any
seven.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hundred dollar big red.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup’s
getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try
shuffleboard.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Uncle Palsy? Shake’em this
direction.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Four, hard four. The point is four.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Good now throw it before you fucking
keel over and die, old man.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday to
me… Jesus, fuck, I’m another year older already.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: OUT! Seven! Line away.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Don’t take it so hard, pops. Everybody
craps out.</p>
<p><strong>suburbanite</strong>: Now go change your fucking Depends.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Who’s laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! prick!
C’mon, crack wise again… Ya fuckin’ smooth as a Ken doll, no- dick,
suburbanite scum. How’s that for a game?!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That ain’t right, Shelly! Guy fucks up my
game like that. Who the fuck does he think he is?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You’re right. He’s just a piece of shit.
Forget about him.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I thought this joint had more class. Used to
be, we wouldn’t even let bums like that in…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This town… You know, Natalie, all I want to
do is go some place where I can tell day from night. Where they got
clocks on the wall. I can’t breathe around here no more. Four days and
I’m gone. I’m not even sure I can hold out that long.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: So where does that leave us?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: A week ago, I didn’t remember what it was
like to have a woman’s hands on me. I’m still pinching myself, expecting
to wake-up from… Come with me, Natalie. I want you to come with me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: God, Bernie, that’s…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to spring that on
you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie… I want to be with you. I do. But I
don’t know if I can leave with you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I was working on a compatibility chart for
the two of us. And it looks good, really, it does.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: So, what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: That’s with us here. In Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Maybe I was being presumptuous, ’cause I
knew you were leaving… and I tried working it in different ways… It
wasn’t good, Bernie. I got scared. But that’s just for now, for the
immediate future. Once the planets realign, maybe a year from now…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie… I can’t… Not another year. Not
another week.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I think… we probably shouldn’t see each
other anymore.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Why, Bernie? We only got a couple days left
together. Why not make the most of them?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Because if I spend one more night in your
arms, I’m not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: And that’s so bad?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Take care, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie, don’t…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Get you another?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I think you better bring me the bottle.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Chang, party of fifteen, your table is ready,
Chang party of fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Come on, Mikey. This is our future. Don’t
blow it.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Put this on the line for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: With shoes!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Dealer’s got shoes. Hands high, the dice
are out! The point is nine.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Come on all you’s. Put a good thought in
for our baby!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Six the hard way!</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He knows.
He knows you’re all pulling for him. God bless you all.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Six the hard way! Look out, we got a
shooter!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Eighteen thousand since I stepped up. I’m
sorry, Shelly, I guess I’ve been hit and miss lately.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Fucking amateurs…</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Seven out! Line away.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I thank you. My wife thanks you. My unborn
child thanks you.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Color me up will ya?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’ve gotta be kidding me. That’s not how I
propose we handle it. We’ll turn the matter over to the authorities.
They’ll be blacklisted, their credit ruined…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: And then we’ll give ’em both a lollipop for
the ride home. Come watch and learn, Harvard. A little lesson on how to
protect your investment – the old school way.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hey, that was some run you had back
there.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Why don’t we go do this in my office? I
don’t like to hand out all this amount of cash on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Oh my God… I can feel the contractions
coming on…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly, stop them! Don’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing to do
with you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It’s got everything to do with me. He’s my
son.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I said, he’s my –</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Who? This little prick?</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: Pop, help me…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly, don’t you fucking do it!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Were you in on this? Jesus, you better come
clean with me.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: NO! God, no! I didn’t know nothing about
it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How much you think their lives are worth,
Bernie? Myself, I don’t think they’re worth piss. But, hey, it ain’t my
kid…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Let me see: they were up almost a hundred
and fifty grand. That’s 150 G’s someone’s gonna have to account for.
What do you say, Bernie, seventy- five grand a piece?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hey, I know you don’t have that kind of
cash. But, since you’re a friend of the house, I’m willing to front
you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly, they didn’t get away with the money…
You didn’t lose anything…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh Jesus… Yes! All right. It’s on me. 150
G’s.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Oh god, oh god… you gotta get me to the
hospital… contractions…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly, please help her. That’s my
grandson…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hey, why don’t we all break out the
champagne? Lootz is about to become a granddaddy. How you doin’ there,
sweetheart? Must hurt like crap, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Hurts so bad…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jesus NOOOOO!!!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Here! It’s a fuckin’ boy. Anyone got a
cigar?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You sure you still want to be good for it?
Because if you want to change your mind, I don’t blame you.</p>
<p><strong>mikey</strong>: I’ll make it up to you, Pop, I swear…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s the worst fucking call you ever made
in your life.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What are you doing?! I thought we had –</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: 150 G’s buys their lives. This is just a
little slap on the wrist to remember me by.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: Oh god… it wasn’t my idea.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You know, motherhood is a beautiful thing.
This… you made a mockery out of it. Maybe you’ll get to experience it
for real one day.</p>
<p><strong>charlene</strong>: I want… to be a mother… please don’t hurt
me…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Get ’em outta here. You ever see them in
this joint again, kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You two, you’re still on shift.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I did this to myself. I planted the seed.
When Angela took off with Mikey, I didn’t… I never made an effort to get
back in his life. I figured, the kid don’t need a loser for a father.
Now it’s all come full circle. I give him the money, I open the door to
all this… I musta had it coming. Payback.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie, it’s a big world out there. If you
just took off – if we took off.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You awake, Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I – think I love you.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, I don’t think. I’m pretty certain of
it.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I never
saw this coming. You shouldn’t do that to a girl.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: There’s still things you don’t know… should
know… I don’t want to ruin it…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: It won’t make any difference, Natalie.
Whatever you come clean about, I’m not gonna feel any different about
you. I’d say the words, but with my luck…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Say ’em anyway. To hell with rotten luck.
That’s overs.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I love you, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Trixie?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Trix. You came back.</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl.
We hear the record player needle drop on “Luck Be A Lady.” Cut to:</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah, it’s me. Get Bernie over to crap table
six.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Got any cre –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Lovett, party of six, your table is ready,
Lovett, party of six.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Duty calls.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new
Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, ’cause she’s one frigid broad. Sure,
once in a while she’ll flash you a bit of tit, but your chances of
hitting a home run – one in twenty million. Here, give her a shot…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You wanna tell me what’s going on out
there?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What do you mean…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What do you mean, you don’t know? We’re down
almost a mil out there. Doesn’t seem strange to you?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Guess I’m having an off day.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You don’t have off days, Lootz. You’re
shitty luck incarnate. What’s wrong? You coming down with something?
You’ve got this look about you…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Nothing’s wrong. Fact is, I’ve never felt
better.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: She loves me, Shelly. She told me last
night. Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>floor manager</strong>: Sweet Jesus… you popped her
cherries.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Natalie? She told you, she loves you?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Put that fucking thing out!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You should be. You’ve gone and fucked it up
big time. I paid you to be his cooze companion, not his fucking true
love. But, no, you had to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck.
“I love you, Bernie.” You know what you’ve gone and done, sweetheart?
Those four little words of endearment have already cost this casino a
million and counting today.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Lady luck. You never heard’a lady luck?!
That’s what’s goin’ on out there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick. He
should have ‘em throwing ice cubes out there, but instead I got a
fuckin’ meltdown on my hands.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: OK, here’s what’s gonna happen. You’re outta
his life by the time he gets home. Don’t even tell him to his face, just
leave a note. I’ll make some calls, situate you at another joint.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It wasn’t an act. I meant it. I love
him.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What’s there to fuckin’ love? He’s a loser.
Always has been, always will be.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I thought you were his friend…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: And I thought you were a smart cookie when I
picked you out. You do not want to fuck me over, darlin’. I’ll see to it
that your next John’s a rattlesnake out in the desert. Now get the fuck
outta here.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? I’m
supposed to give her a ride home.</p>
<p><strong>cocktail waitress #1</strong>: I think she left already. She
wasn’t feelin’ too good. We been covering for her.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie? You in there?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I want you to tell me the truth, Shelly. Did
you say something to Natalie? Did you muscle her –</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think of me?
That I would fuck with your happiness? That hurts.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: This guy’s all flash. No soul. I miss Buddy.
Place isn’t the same without him.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy out. It
coulda been a lot worse…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You gave him an easy out? What are you
talkin’ about? I thought he…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: He woulda never taken the buy-out offer.
Buddy woulda stuck to his guns, no matter what. And they woulda ended up
hurting him. I couldn’t let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jesus… you… How can you sit here and justify
it? Like you were Dr. Kevorkian or something?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Listen to me, you dumb fuck – I loved that
sonofabitch. But his time was up. What I was supposed to do, leave him
to those corporate wolves? What I did, it was the humanitarian thing.
That I have no doubt about. Afterwards, I held him in my arms and I
cried like a fucking baby. What? You got this look – what’s this fucking
look?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie? You awake?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Let’s just take off.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I mean it. Let’s just pack up and go.
Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I can’t do that. I’ve got an obligation to
Shelly. There’s no –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Fuck Shelly. He doesn’t give a shit about
you. Let’s just climb into your car and get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I can’t do that, Natalie. They’d come after
me. And because you were with me… I wouldn’t want that on me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Just hold me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Hey! Ouch! What are you…?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You got no fucking right…!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What did I tell you?! What did I fuckin’
tell you?!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I tried… I couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t give a fuck!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You’re gone, sweetheart. History. Kiss
paradise goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I can’t leave! I won’t! I love him. Doesn’t
that mean anything to you, you heartless fuck?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Who the fuck do you think you are? You ain’t
nobody! I could make you disappear like this… And nobody would ever
notice you were gone. Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie would! I got friends! You don’t
fuckin’ own me. You got no right –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You fuckin’ cunt…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You think that’s bad? That’s just a taste,
bitch. You’re still here when Bernie gets home and I’ll finish the job.
I’ll cut you into so many fuckin’ pieces, the vultures’ll be trading on
you for a month.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Here… go get yourself some cosmetic
surgery.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: No, don’t. I’ve got a headache.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Did you take something? I got some aspirin
in the –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Yeah. I already took something.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie, what happened? The mirror…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie, no! Shit…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh Jesus… Natalie, who did this to you? We
need to call the police…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I love you, Bernie. I just want you to know
that. I fell in love with you. That wasn’t part of the plan. I thought…
easy money…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Shelly. He paid me to get next to you. To
keep you around. Whatever it took…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You got it right the first night. I was for
sale. Bought and paid for. You were the easy mark, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: At first you were just another John. But
then I started to take a closer look. For the first time, here was
someone who wasn’t trying to hustle me. Wasn’t pretending to be somebody
he wasn’t. Just a decent guy trying to get back on track. And it didn’t
hurt any that you put me up on a pedestal. It sure puts the gutter into
perspective…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shelly…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring you
luck. Lady luck. I stayed… to tell you to your face… and then you
wouldn’t want me no more… and I could just go…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We gotta get you to the hospital. We’ll talk
about this later.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell me
there’s gonna be a later.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Ssshh.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it’s all
gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Everything’s gonna be fine. This is our
time. This is you and me and we’re going for it.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You look in the mirror, you don’t like what
you see, don’t believe it. You look in my eyes. That’s the only mirror
you gonna need. Look in my eyes, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I love you. Marry me?</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: You don’t have to do this, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right to his
face. I will not look over my shoulder for the rest of my life – our
lives.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Bernie, your chart… that first night. I
wasn’t being straight with you. It’s the worst chart I’ve ever seen.
There’s nothing in the cards for you. I’m scared…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Don’t you see, that was before you opened
your heart to me. Everything’s different now. I got lady luck on my
side. Ain’t nothing gonna happen to me.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s three thousand dollars. Take it. Maybe
Shelly’ll accept it as a down payment. We can send him the rest in
installments… after we get settled.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Whatever happens, I –</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I know, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Bernie, what’s the matter? You look a little
fucking spooked.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You lay another finger on her, I swear to
God I’ll kill you. You hear me? I’ll fuckin’ kill you!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Will you excuse me for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Why? Why, Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Because you never give up a good thing,
Bernie. You are a good thing. The best fuckin’ cooler there ever was.
And I need him back.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He ain’t never comin’ back.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s a dead man talking.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m through with this joint, Shelly. Natalie
and me, we just got married. We’re outta here. I’ll get a job out there
in the world. Send you half my paycheck every month. Make good on my
obligations.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You try to walk on me, Bernie, and I’ll
fuckin’ bury you. The both of you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain’t the
world’s biggest loser no more. That honor’s gonna fall upon you, Shelly.
And maybe you had it all along.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What the fuck? Me? I’m the loser?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What you got? What do you got in your life
besides this joint?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What the fuck more do I need?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You got nothin’, Shelly. This place – your
legacy – it’s a mirage. You turn your back and it don’t even exist.
There’s no day, there’s no night, it’s all just one big fuckin’ blur and
it don’t count for nothin’!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You believe this fuckin’ guy?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you got
this fear of germs thing. But it goes deeper than that. You can’t get
close to no one. On an emotional level. You’re the worst kind of gambler
there ever was: too scared to put his chips on the table. Too scared to
open his heart… to extend any real kinda friendship. Always afraid it’s
gonna end out in the desert. Well, sweet fuckin’ dreams, pal, ’cause I’m
out and if that’s where it ends, that’s where it ends.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s a real heartfelt speech, Lootz. All
that Jimmy Stewart in ya face intensity. You almost sold me. Man, I’ve
got a fucking lump in my throat. But it still don’t change things. You
bail on me without making good on my 150 G’s and I’m gonna be forced to
close the books on you. You and the broad. You leave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Change only…</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Check change three thousand.</p>
<p><strong>boxman</strong>: This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You could say that.</p>
<p><strong>boxman</strong>: Well, it’ll be a short one. Table’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: It is now, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Yo Eleven! Pay the line.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Winner seven!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Six easy. Easy way six!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Natalie… this is you…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: For the boys.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Okay, we’re coming out. Get your YO bets,
C&amp;E, any seven…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Shelly, take a look at number 4.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How much is he up?</p>
<p><strong>boxman</strong>: Around three hundred thousand.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Why didn’t one of you fucking geniuses call
me?</p>
<p><strong>boxman</strong>: We tried. You weren’t picking up. Besides,
it was Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Alright. We’re coming out folks, hands
high…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Color me up a hundred fifty thousand. And
give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That’s what I owe you, Shelly. There it is.
We’re square. Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives up to his
obligations.</p>
<p><strong>boxman</strong>: One hundred fifty thousand, coming in.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s the matter with you? He’s one of ours
and he’s taking us to the fucking cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Lootz’s off the clock. As long as he’s off
the clock, he’s free to play. Just like every other schmuck in this
joint.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: It smells wrong. I’m shutting him down. He’s
not leaving here with a dime –</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Now you listen real good, you Harvard turd.
Lootz is on the up-and-up. He leaves here tonight with whatever he comes
out with. You so much as touch a hair on his head and I’ll fucking
wallpaper this joint with your ass. Muted tones, right? What’s that? I
don’t hear nothing. Wait a minute – yeah, now I hear it.</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Crap ace deuce! Line down!</p>
<p><strong>stickman</strong>: Call it.</p>
<p><strong>croupier</strong>: Twelve crap.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Fifty thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: On the field? What’re you fucking nuts?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>man 2</strong>: Shake it, don’t break it, baby!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Come on sixty-six!</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Thank God… I thought for sure…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: It’s okay, right? You guys worked it out.
He took the three grand? Tell me it’s okay, Bernie?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Want me to get that, Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>wider</strong>: Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance.
Kicking the debris around the office.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: What are you stopping for?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I think I’m gonna…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bahamas, here we come, baby.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Step out of the car please.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: What’s the problem, officer?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Just step out of the car, please. Both of
you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If my driving… if I was going a little fast
– I was just over excited, officer. See, we just had a big win at the
Shangri-la –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You didn’t win nothing.</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was too
good to be true. Who were we kidding?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get down on your knees. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The kid wants you should know, Shelly, he’s
just protecting our investment – the old school way. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He was drunk. It was just freak luck…</p>
<p><strong>natalie</strong>: Don’t give it a name, Bernie. It scares me.
All I know is, you’re still running hot and that’s a good thing. But
we’re only winners if we keep going. No looking back.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Lady luck, Natalie. I’m calling it. Lady
luck. And we got it as long as we’re together. They can’t touch us
now.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Gentlemen… I thank you for your vote of
confidence. As the Shangri-la’s new Director of Casino Operations, I’m
gonna make a personal guarantee to each and every one of you. Your
investment in this casino will be well looked after. The future looks
bright, gentlemen. Very, very bright.</p>
