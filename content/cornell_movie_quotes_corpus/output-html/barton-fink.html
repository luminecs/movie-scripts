<h1 id="barton-fink">barton-fink</h1>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: I’m blowin’ out of here, blowin’ for good.
I’m kissin’ it all goodbye, these four stinkin’ walls, the six flights
up, the el that roars by at three A.M. like a castiron wind. Kiss ’em
goodbye for me, Maury! I’ll miss ’em � like hell I will!</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: Dreaming again!</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Not this time, Lil! I’m awake now, awake for
the first time in years. Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a dream if
you’ve lived with your eyes closed. Well my eyes are open now! I see
that choir, and I know they’re dressed in rags! But we’re part of that
choir, both of us � yeah, and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: The sun’s coming up, kid. They’ll be hawking
the fish down on Fulton Street.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Let ’em hawk. Let ’em sing their hearts
out.</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: That’s it, kid. Take that ruined choir. Make
it sing!</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: So long, Maury.</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: So long.</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: We’ll hear from that kid. And I don’t mean a
postcard.</p>
<p><strong>lily</strong>: Let’s spit on our hands and get to work. It’s
late, Maury.</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: Not any more Lil…</p>
<p><strong>maury</strong>: …It’s early.</p>
<p><strong>maitre ’d</strong>: Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink…
several members of your party have already arrived…</p>
<p><strong>fink</strong>: Is Garland Stanford here?</p>
<p><strong>maitre ’d</strong>: He called to say he’d be a few minutes
late… Ah, here we are…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Barton, Barton, so glad you could make it. You
know Richard St. Claire…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …and Poppy Carnahan. We’re drinking champagne,
dear boy, in honor of the occasion. Have you seen the Herald?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I don’t want to embarrass you but Caven
could hardly contain himself. But more important, Richard and Poppy here
loved the play.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Loved it! What power!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, it was a corker.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Thanks, Richard, but I know for a fact the
only fish you’ve ever seen were tacked to a the wall of the yacht
club.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all
devastated.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Weeping! Copius tears! What did the Herald
say?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I happen to have it with me.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Please Derek �</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Do read it, do!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: “Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the Common
Man. The star of the Bare Ruined Choirs was not seen on the stage of the
Belasco last night � though the thespians involved all acquitted
themselves admirably. The find of the evening was the author of this
drama about simple folk � fish mongers, in fact � whose brute struggle
for existence cannot quite quell their longing for something higher. The
playwright finds nobility in the most squalid corners and poetry in the
most callused speech. A tough new voice in the American theater has
arrived, and the owner of that voice is named… Barton Fink.”</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: They’ll be wrapping fish in it in the
morning so I guess it’s not a total waste.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Cynic!</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Well we can enjoy your success, Barton, even
if you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Don’t get me wrong � I’m glad it’ll do well
for you, Derek.</p>
<p><strong>derek</strong>: Don’t worry about me, dear boy � I want you
to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: All right, but I can’t start listening to
the critics, and I can’t kid myself about my own work. A writer writes
from his gut, and his gut tells him what’s good and what’s… merely
adequate.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Well I don’t pretend to be a critic, but
Lord, I have a gut, and it tells me it was simply marvelous.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: And a charming gut it is.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You dog!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Aaa-woooooooo!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I thought you were going to join us. Jesus,
Garland, you left me alone with those people.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Don’t panic, I’ll join you in a minute.
What’s you think of Richard and Poppy?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: The play was marvelous. She wept, copiously.
Millions of dollars and no sense.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: We have to talk a little business. I’ve
just been on the phone to Los Angeles. Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to
put you under contract. They’ve offered you a thousand dollars a week. I
think I can get them to go as high as two.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: What do you do far a living?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m not sure anymore. I guess I try to make
a difference.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton,
because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One,
here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night � if the
show sells out. Eighty five million people go to the pictures every
week.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: To see pap.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point
number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the
writing of any number of plays.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know, Garland; my place is here
right now. I feel I’m on the brink of success-</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: I’d say you’re already enjoying some.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, Garland, don’t you see? Not the kind of
success where the critics fawn over you or the producers like Derek make
a lot of money. No, a real success � the success we’ve been dreaming
about � the creation of a new, living theater of, about, and for the
common man! If I ran off to Hollywood now I’d be making money, going to
parties, meeting the big shots, sure, but I’d be cutting myself off from
the wellspring of that success, from the common man.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …I guess I’m sprouting off again. But I am
certain of this, Garland: I’m capable of more good work. Maybe better
work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn’t seem to me that Los Angeles
is the place to lead the life of mind.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Okay Barton, you’re the artist, I’m just
the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I’ll make it happen. I’m
only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism � if I
can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: …Look, they love you, kid � everybody does.
You see Caven’s review in the Herald?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, what did it say?</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Take my copy. You’re the toast of Broadway
and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash � strike
that, a lot of cash.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: …The common man’ll still be here when you
get back. What the hell, they might even have one or two of ’em out in
Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …That’s a rationalization, Garland.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Barton, it was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m checking in. Barton Fink.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Must be.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Okay then, everything seems to be in order.
Everything seems to be in order.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: …Are you a tranz or a rez?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Transient or resident?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know… I mean, I’ll be here, uh,
indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Rez. That’ll be twenty-five fifty a week
payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget
that on account you’re a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you
dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is
Chet.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, I’m going to be working here, mostly
at night; I’m a writer. Do you have room service?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Kitchen closes at eight but I’m the night
clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: …Though we provide privacy for the
residential guest, we are also a full service hotel including
complimentary shoe shine. My name is Chet.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: …Okay</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Okey-dokey, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What �</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Don’t you wanna go to your room?!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …What number is it?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: …Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: …Those your only bags?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: The others are being sent.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll keep an eye out for them. I’ll keep my
eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Six, please.</p>
<p><strong>elevator man</strong>: Next stop: Six.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: How d’ya like your room!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Chet!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Who?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Chet! From downstairs!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …How d’ya like your room!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is that him?! Barton Fink?! Lemme put my arms
around this guy!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …How the hell are ya? Good trip?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this dump. You
know that � you read the papers.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lou treating you all right? Got everything you
need? What the hell’s the matter with your face? What the hell’s the
matter with his face, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: It’s not as bad as it looks; just a mosquito
in my room �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Place okay?</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Where did we put him?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m at the Earle.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Never heard of it. Let’s move him to the
Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Thanks, but I wanted a place that was
less…</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it’s not a
dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at
Capitol Pictures. You don’t believe me, take a look at your paycheck at
the end of every week � that’s what we think of the writer. …so what
kind of pictures does he like?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mr. Fink hasn’t given a preference,
Mr. Lipnik.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: How’s about it, Bart?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: To be honest, I don’t go to the pictures
much, Mr. Lipnik �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: That’s okay, that’s okay, that’s okay �
that’s just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was
going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something
about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical
mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We’re only interested in one
thing: Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you make us laugh, can you make
us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more
than one thing? Okay. The point is, I run this dump and I don’t know the
technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I’ve got horse-sense, goddamnit.
Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner
than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I
don’t mean my dick’s bigger than yours, it’s not a sexual thing �
although, you’re the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …He used to have shares in the company. An
ownership interest. Got bought out in the twenties � muscled out
according to some. Hell, according to me. So we keep him around, he’s
got a family. Poor schmuck. He’s sensitive, don’t mention the old days.
Oh hell, say whatever you want. Look, barring a preference, Bart, we’re
gonna put you to work on a wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I say this
because they tell me you know the poetry of the street. That would rule
out westerns, pirate pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman…</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: But look, I’m not one of these guys thinks
poetic has gotta be fruity. We’re together on that, aren’t we? I mean
I’m from New York myself � well, Minsk if you wanna go way back, which
we won’t if you don’t mind and I ain’t askin’. Now people’re gonna tell
you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, it’s a B picture. You tell them,
bullshit. We don’t make B pictures here at Capitol. Let’s put a stop to
that rumor right now.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about
the Wallace Beery picture.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Excellent picture.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: We got a treatment on it yet?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story.
Saturday Evening Post.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery
is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he’ll have
to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know
the drill. Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do
you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest? Look at
me, a writer in the room and I’m askin’ Lou what the goddamn story
should be!</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Both maybe?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …Maybe we should do a treatment.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it. He’ll
get into the swing of things or I don’t know writers. Let’s make it a
dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don’t gotta tackle the world our first
time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling,
but since you’re Barton Fink I’m assuming you have it in spades.
Seriously Bart, I like you. We’re off to a good start. Dammit, if all
our writers were like you I wouldn’t have to get so goddamn involved.
I’d like to see something by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Heard about your show, by the way. My man
in New York saw it. Tells me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty damn
moving. A little fruity, he said, but I guess you know what you’re
doing. Thank you for your heart. We need more heart in pictures. We’re
all expecting great things.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Hello… Chet? This is Barton Fink in room
605. Yes, there’s uh, there’s someone in the room next door to mine,
604, and he’s uh… He’s uh… making a lot of… noise.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did you… Somebody just complained…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, I didn’t � I mean, I did call down, not
to complain exactly, I was just concerned that you might � not that it’s
my business, but that you might be in some kind of… distress. You see, I
was trying to work, and it’s, well, it was difficult �</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah. I’m damn sorry, if I bothered you. The
damn walls here, well, I just apologize like hell…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …My name’s Charlie Meadows. I guess we’re
neighbors…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Barton Fink.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Neighbor, I’d feel better about the damned
inconvenience if you’d let me buy you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s all right, really, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: All right, hell, you trying to work and me
carrying on in there. Look, the liquor’s good, wuddya say?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … You got a glass? It’s the least I can
do.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Okay… a quick one, sure…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the
carryings-on next door.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s okay, I assure you. It’s just that I
was trying to work �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you
don’t mind my asking?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, I’m a writer, actually.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t say. That’s a tough racket. My
hat’s off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work,
I’d imagine.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Can be. Not easy, but �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Damned difficult, I’d imagine.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: And what’s your line, Mr. Meadows?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you
might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game � door-to-door,
human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …In spite of what you might think from
tonight, I’m pretty good at it.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Doesn’t surprise me at all.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire,
theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people �
that’s what I tell ’em. Writing doesn’t work out, you might want to look
into it. Providing for basic human need � a fella could do worse.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Thanks, I’ll keep it in mind.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What kind of scribbler are you �
newspaperman did you say?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, I’m actually writing for the pictures
now �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Pictures! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …I’m sorry, brother, I was just sitting
here thinking I was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make
good. Hell, you’ve got it made! Writing for pictures! Beating out that
competition! And me being patronizing!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Is the egg showing or what?!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s okay; actually I am just starting out
in the movies � though I was pretty well established in New York, some
renown there,</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, it’s an exciting time then. I’m not the
best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it’s no surprise I didn’t
recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s okay, Charlie. I’m a playwright. My
shows’ve only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the
Herald. I guess that’s why they wanted me here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What
kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What do I write about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that’s
it, Bart.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, that’s a good question. Strange as it
may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average
working stiff. The common man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well ain’t that a kick in the head!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that’s
exactly the point. There’s a few people in New York � hopefully our
numbers are growing � who feel we have an opportunity now to forge
something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the
masses that’s based on a few simple truths � not on some shopworn
abstractions about drama that doesn’t hold true today, if they ever
did…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …I don’t guess this means much to you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hell, I could tell you some stories�</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: And that’s the point, that we all have
stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of
any king. It’s the stuff of life � why shouldn’t it be the stuff of
theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don’t
call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our
theater.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can see you feel pretty strongly about
it.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, I don’t mean to get up on my high
horse, but why shouldn’t we look at ourselves up there? Who cares about
the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and � and � and who
killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I can feel my butt getting sore
already.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I’m
saying � a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you’re a
real man!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And I could tell you some stories �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sure you could! And yet many writers do
everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man �
from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and
love and converse and � and � and… so naturally their work suffers, and
regresses into empty formalism and � well, I’m spouting off again, but
to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three
dollar bill.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, I guess that’s tragedy right
there.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Frequently played, seldom remarked.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You’re all right, Charlie. I’m glad you
stopped by. I’m sorry if � well I know I sometimes run on.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hell no! Jesus, I’m the kind of guy, I’ll
let you know if I’m bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I’m
the kind schmoe who’s generally interested in the other guy’s point of
view.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, we’ve got something in common
then.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well Christ, if there’s any way I can
contribute, or help, or whatever�</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just
being yourself.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I can tell you some stories �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …And look, I’m sorry as hell about the
interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other
people in the world.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: See you, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: He looks around to the opposite � bed �
wall.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: I’m eating on the lot today �</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: More please.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I
should drop by morning to see you about the �</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Ever act?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Huh? No, I’m �</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: We need Indians for a Norman Steele
western.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m a writer. Ted O �</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go;
we always need Indians.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m a writer. Ted Okum said you’re producing
this Wallace Beery picture I’m working on.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: What!? Ted Okum doesn’t know shit. They’ve
assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn’t
know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Then who should I talk to?</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Get me Lou Breeze.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Is he in for Mr. Geisler?</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Lou? How’s Lipnik’s ass smell this
morning?… Yeah?… Yeah?… Okay, the reason I’m calling, I got a writer
here, Fink, all screwy. Says I’m producing that Wallace Beery wrestling
picture � what’m I, the goddamn janitor around here?… Yeah, well who’d
you get that from?… Yeah, well tell Lipnik he can kiss my dimpled ass…
Shit! No, alright… No, no, all right.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: …Okay kid, let’s chow.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Don’t worry about it. It’s just a B
picture. I bring it in on budget, they’ll book it without even screening
it. Life is too short.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the
script, see something by the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Sure he did. And he forgot about it before
your ass left his sofa.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Okay. I’m just having trouble getting
started. It’s funny, I’m blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of
indication of… what’s expected �</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do
you need, a road map?</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: …Look, you’re confused? You need guidance?
Talk to another writer.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Jesus, throw a rock in here, you’ll hit
one. And do me a favor, Fink: Throw it hard.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Barton Fink.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Jesus. W.P.!</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: W.P. Mayhew? The writer?</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Just Bill, please.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Bill!…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …You’re the finest novelist of our time.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein’ occupied
here in the worship of Mammon, I haven’t had the chance yet to see your
play �</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the news reaches
us in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sir, I’m flattered that you even recognize
my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: All of us undomesticated writers eventually
make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that’s why I allus
have such a powerful thrust.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: It’s still a little early for me.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Bill, if I’m imposing you should say so, I
know you’re very busy � I just, uh… I just wonder if I could ask you a
favor… That is to say, uh… have you ever written a wrestling
picture?</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …You are drippin’, suh.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …Mistuh Fink, they have not invented a genre
of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited
to essay. I have taken my stabs at the wrastlin’ form, as I have stabbed
at so many others, and with as little success. I gather that you are a
fresh-man here, eager for an upperclassman’s council. However, just at
the moment…</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …I have drinkin’ to do. Why don’t you stop
at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …and we will discuss wrastlin’ scenarios and
other things lit’rary.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m sorry, I… My name is Fink… Uh, Bill
asked me to drop by this afternoon. Is he in?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the moment�</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Fink, I’m Audrey Taylor, Mr. Mayhew’s
personal secretary. I know this all must sound horrid. I really do
apologize…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Is, uh… Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He will be… When he can’t write, he
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I am sorry, it’s so embarassing.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: How about you? Will you be alright?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’ll be fine… Are you a writer, Mr Fink?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yes I am. I’m working on a wres � please
call me Barton.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’ll tell Bill you dropped by. I’m sure
he’ll want to reschedule your appointment.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Perhaps you and I could get together at some
point also. �I’m sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just… I don’t know
anyone here in this town.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Please, Barton.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton. You see, Barton, I’m not just Bill’s
secretary � Bill and I are… I love. We-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …I know this must look… funny.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, no �</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: We need each other. We give each other… the
things we need �</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: M’HONEY!!… bastard-ass sons of bitches… the
water’s lappin’ up…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don’t judge us.
Please…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Howdy, neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie. How are you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus, I hope I’m not interrupting you
again. I heard you walking around in here. Figured I’d drop by.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn’t really gotten
started yet � what happened to your ear?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.
Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it
to staunch the flow of pus. Don’t worry, it’s not contagious.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Seen a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ah, doctors. What’s he gonna tell me? Can’t
trade my head in for a new one.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, I guess you’re stuck with the one you’ve
got. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks, I’d invite you over to my place,
but it’s a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I myself have yet to be lassoed.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Got a sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No… I guess it’s something about my work. I
get so worked up over it, I don’t know; I don’t really have a lot of
attention left over, so it would be a little unfair…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In
my experience, they pretend to give it, but it’s generally a smoke-
screen for demanding it back � with interest. How about family, Bart?
How’re you fixed in that department?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: My folks live in Brooklyn, with my
uncle.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mine have passed on. It’s just the three of
us now…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …What’s the expression � me myself and
I.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sure, that’s tough, but in a sense, we’re
all alone in this world aren’t we Charlie? I’m often surrounded by
family and friends, but…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mm… You’re no stranger to loneliness, then.
I guess I got no beef; especially where the dames are concerned. In my
line of work I get opportunities galore � always on the wing, you know
what I’m saying. I could tell stories to curl your hair � but it looks
like you’ve already heard ’em!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …That’s me in Kansas City, plying my
trade.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …It was taken by one of my policy holders.
They’re more than just customers to me, Barton. They really appreciate
what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time
�</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie. Your
daily routine � you know what’s expected. You know the drill. My job is
to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside,
something honest. There’s no road map for that territory…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …and exploring it can be painful. The kind
of pain most people don’t know anything about.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …This must be boring you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not at all. It’s damned interesting.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Probably sounds a little grand coming from
someone who’s writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Beery! You got no beef there! He’s good.
Hell of an actor � though, for my money, you can’t beat Jack Oakie. A
stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don’t get me wrong � Beery,
a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in
school. I guess you know the basic moves.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Nope, never watched any. I’m not that
interested in the act itself �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay, but hell, you should know what it is.
I can show you in about thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …You’re a little out of your weight class,
but just for purposes of demonstration �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s all right, really �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in
the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right
hand here…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …and your left hand here.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …You can do it, champ!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …All right now, when I say “Ready…
wrestle!” you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That’s the whole
game. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ready… wrestle!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Damn, there I go again. We’re gonna wake
the downstairs neighbors. I didn’t hurt ya, did I?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, that’s all that wrestling is. Except
usually there’s more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it’s
your first time. And you’re out of your weight class.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Jesus, I did hurt you!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …I’m just a big, clumsy lug. I sure do
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …You sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m fine, Charlie. Really I am. Actually,
it’s been helpful, but I guess I should get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, it wasn’t fair of me to do that. I’m
pretty well endowed physically.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Don’t feel bad, though. I wouldn’t be much
of a match for you at mental gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you need
anything.</p>
<p><strong>by</strong>: W.P. Mayhew”</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: If I close m’eyes I can almost smell the
live oak.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: That’s hamburger grease, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Well, m’olfactory’s turnin’ womanish on me �
lyin’ and deceitful…</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …Still, I must say. I haven’t felt peace
like this since the grand productive days. Don’t you find it so, Barton?
Ain’t writin’ peace?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well… actually, no Bill…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …No, I’ve always found that writing comes
from a great inner pain. Maybe it’s a pain that comes from a realization
that one must do something for one’s fellow man � to help somehow to
ease his suffering. Maybe it’s a personal pain. At any rate, I don’t
believe good work is possible without it.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn’ things up.
Yessir. Escape… It’s when I can’t write, can’t escape m’self, that I
want to tear m’head off and run screamin’ down the street with m’balls
in a fruitpickers pail. Mm…</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: …This’ll sometimes help.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: That doesn’t help anything, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That’s true, Bill. I’ve never found it to
help my writing.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Your writing? Son, have you ever heard the
story of Soloman’s mammy-</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You should read this, Barton. I think it’s
Bill’s finest, or among his finest anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: So now I’m s’posed to roll over like an ol’
bitch dog gettin’ ger belly scratched.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Bill �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Look, maybe it’s none of my business, but a
man with your talent � don’t you think your first obligation would be to
your gift? Shouldn’t you be doing whatever you have to do to work
again?</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: And what would that be, son?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know exactly. But I do know what
you’re doing with that drink. You’re cutting yourself off from your
gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from
everything your art is about.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: No son, thisahere moonshine’s got nothin’ to
do with shuttin’ folks out. No, I’m usin’ it to build somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: I’m buildin’ a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by
brick. Raisin’ up a levee to keep that ragin’ river of manure from
lappin’ at m’door.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Maybe you better too, Barton. Before you get
buried under his manure.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: M’honey pretends to be impatient with me,
Barton, but she’ll put up with anything.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Not anything, Bill. Don’t test me.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You’re lucky she puts up with as much as she
does.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy’s eye. People who
know about the human heart, though, mebbe they’d say, Bill over here, he
gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity � the basest coin
there is.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Stop it, Bill!</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: The truth, m’honey, is a tart that does not
bear scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Breach my levee at your peril!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: That son of a bitch… Don’t get me wrong,
he’s a fine writer.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: I’ll jus’ walk on down to the Pacific, and
from there I’ll… improvise.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Silent upon a hill in Darien!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Audrey, you can’t put up with this.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …Oh Barton, I feel so… sorry for him!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What?! He’s a son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No, sometimes he just… well, he thinks about
Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She’s… disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Really?…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Well that doesn’t excuse his behavior.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He’ll wander back when he’s sober and
apologize. He always does.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Okay, but that doesn’t excuse his �</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton. Empathy requires… understanding.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What. What don’t I understand?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I hope these are your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Hi, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Because that would mean they gave you
mine.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on
in.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus, what a day I’ve had. Ever had one of
those days?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Seems like nothing but, lately.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn’t’ve
sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don’t want insurance,
so okay, that’s your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have
to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift
myself.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A little lift, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Good thing they bottle it, huh pal?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Did I say rude? People can be goddamn
cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I’ve got a weight
problem. That’s my cross to bear. I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well it’s… it’s a defense mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Defense against what? Insurance? Something
they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little
peace of mind?…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Finally decided to knock off early, take
your advice. Went to see a doctor about this.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …He told me it was an ear infection. Ten
dollars, please. I said, hell, I told YOU my ear was infected. Why don’t
YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, THAT led to an argument…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Listen to me belly-achin’. As if my
problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, it’s been better. I can’t seem to get
going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started �
I still haven’t gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me � my play.
Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like
a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Those two love-birds next door drivin’ you
nuts?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: How did you know about that?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Know about it? I can practically see how
they’re doin’ it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, but �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Seems like I hear everything that goes on
in this dump. Pipes or somethin’. I’m just glad I don’t have to ply MY
trade in the wee-wee hours.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Ah, you’ll lick this picture business,
believe me. You’ve got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say?
Where there’s a head, there’s a hope?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Where there’s life there’s hope.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That proves you really are a writer!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: And there’s hope for you too, Charlie.
Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta
pull up stakes temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: In a few days. Out to your stompin’ grounds
as a matter of fact � New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at
the Head Office.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I’ll
miss you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well hell, buddy, don’t pull a long face!
This is still home for me � I keep my room, and I’ll be back sooner or
later…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …And � mark my words � by the time I get
back you’re picture’ll be finished. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: New York can be pretty cruel to strangers,
Charlie. If you need a home-cooked meal you just look up Morris and
Lillian Fink. They live on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Your room does that too?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I guess the heat’s sweating off the
wallpaper.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What a dump…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like
you.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well it’s pathetic, isn’t it? I mean to a
guy from New York.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This kind of heat. It’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, I guess you pick your poison.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So they say.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Don’t pick up and leave without saying
goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Course not, compadre. You’ll see me
again.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Barton Fink.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Yeah. Fink. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Wuddya got for me � what the hell happened
to your face?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Nothing. It’s just a mosquito bite.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in
Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps � this is a desert town. Wuddya
got for me?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well I…</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya
got?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, to tell you the truth, I’m having some
trouble getting started�</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!
You mean you don’t have ANYthing?!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well not much.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: What do you think this is? HAMLET?</p>
<p><strong>gone with the wind? ruggles of red</strong>: GAP? It’s a
goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t really understand that
genre. maybe that’s the prob-</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Understand shit! I though you were gonna
consult another writer on this!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, I’ve talked to Bill Mayhew-</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy’s a
souse!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: He’s a great writer �</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: A souse!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You don’t understand. He’s in pain, because
he can’t write-</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name
on the back of his paycheck every week!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: But… I thought no one cared about this
picture.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: You thought! Where’d you get THAT from? You
thought! I don’t know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the
sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He’s
taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t understand-</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He’s taken an
interest! What the hell did you say to him?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I didn’t say anything-</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Well he’s taken an interest! That means
he’ll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I
drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he’s gonna be all over me
too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it’s going �
don’t worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we
were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the
line. He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I can’t write anything by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Who said write? Jesus, Jack can’t read. You
gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well what do I tell him?</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: Projection…</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: … Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of the
screening rooms free this afternoon?… Good, book it for me. A writer
named Fink is gonna come in and you’re gonna show him wrestling
pictures… I don’t give a shit which ones! WRESTLING pictures! Wait a
minute- isn’t Victor Sjoderberg shooting one now?… Show him some of the
dailies on that.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: …This ought to give you some ideas.</p>
<p><strong>geisler</strong>: …Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at Lipnik’s
house. Ideas. Broad strokes. Don’t cross me, Fink.</p>

you try a number for me in Hollywood… Slausen 6-4304.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Pick it up… Pick it up. Pick it-</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it’s
late and I shouldn’t be calling you like this � believe me I wouldn’t
have if I could see any other alternative, but I � I’m sorry - listen,
how are you � I’m sorry. You doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Barton. I’m sorry, it’s Barton Fink.</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Sons of bitches! Drown ’em all!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton, I’m afraid it’s not a good time-</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Drown all those rascals…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m sorry, I just feel like �I know I
shouldn’t ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline
tomorrow-</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: I said drown ’em all! Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: All right Barton, I’ll see if I can slip
away-</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the
house… sons of bitches…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: If you could, I’d �</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: If I can. He gets jealous; he-</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Goddamn voices… DROWN ’EM!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I need help, Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I’ll try to slip out. If he quiets down,
passes out… I’m afraid he thinks � well, he said you were a buffoon,
Barton. He becomes irrational�</p>
<p><strong>mayhew</strong>: Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN ’EM!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Hello, Barton.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you. I’m
sorry to be such a… such a… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Now that’s all right, Barton. Everything’ll
be all right.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yes. Thank you. How’s Bill?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Oh, he’s… he drifted off. He’ll sleep for a
while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well I have to come up with � an outline,
I’d guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts.
Three acts. The whole goddamn-</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’s alright, Barton. You don’t have to
write actual scenes?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No, but the whole goddamn � Audrey? Have you
ever had to read any of Bill’s wrestling scenarios?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yes, I’m afraid I have.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What are they like? What are they about?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well, usually, they’re… simply morality
tales. There’s a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at
the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he
has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods
type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he’d have the
wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The studio always hated that. Oh,
some of the scripts were so… spirited!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …Barton.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …Look, it’s really just a formula. You don’t
have to type your soul into it. We’ll invent some names and a new
setting. I’ll help you and it won’t take any time at all. I did it for
Bill so many times �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Did what for Bill?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well… THIS.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You wrote his scripts for him?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well, the basic ideas were frequently
his-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You wrote Bill’s scripts! Jesus Christ, you
wrote his � what about before that?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Before what?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Before Bill came to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to
speak-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how
long have you been his… secretary?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR
little project-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I want to know how many of Bill’s books you
wrote!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I want to know!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Barton, honestly, only the last couple-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: And my input was mostly… EDITORIAL, really,
when he’d been drinking-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’ll bet. Jesus � “The grand productive
days.” What a goddamn phony.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …W.P. Mayhew. William Goddamn Phony Mayhew.
All his guff about escape. Hah! I’LL say he escaped!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Well, we don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It’ll be fine… Don’t judge him, Barton.
Don’t condescend to him…</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: …It’s not as simple as you think. I helped
Bill most by appreciating him, by understanding him. We all need
understanding, Barton. Even you, tonight, it’s all you really need…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No!… I’m fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you sure �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No… no…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Barton. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No… Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why don’t we go to your room-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie, I’m in trouble. You’ve gotta help
me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever
the problem is, we’ll sort it out.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie, I’m in trouble � something
horrible’s happened � I’ve gotta call the police…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Will you stay with me till they get
here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Barton. We can sort
it-</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Before you go in � I didn’t do this. I don’t
know how it happened, but I didn’t… I want you to know that…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus… Jesus… Jesus have mercy…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?
What’re we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’ve gotta call the police � or you could
call for me �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hold on �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You gotta believe me �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hold on �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I didn’t do this, I did NOT do this�</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me
what happened.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know! I woke up, she was… God, you
gotta believe me!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I believe you, brother, but this don’t look
good.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: We gotta call the police �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you think happened?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know! Maybe it was her… boyfriend. I
passed out. I don’t know. Won’t the police be able to �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This
does not look good! They hang people for this!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: But I didn’t do it � don’t you believe
me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I believe you � I KNOW you. But why should
the police?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Did you… Barton, between you and me, did
you have sexual intercourse?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus… They can tell that…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta
have mercy!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re in pictures, Barton. Even if you got
cleared eventually, this would ruin you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Wait in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You passed out.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Uh-huh… Where’s Audrey?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She’s dead, Barton! If that was her
name.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Barton, listen to me. You gotta act like
nothing’s happened. Put this totally out of your head. I know that’s
hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as
usual. Give us some time to sort this out…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Just put it out of you head…</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Bart! So happy to see ya!</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then talk!
Drink?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah… rye whiskey?</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!
That’s what I hear, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: … Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things’re going
along great. Thinks we’ve got a real winner in this one. And let me tell
you something, I’m counting on it. I’ve taken an interest. Not to
interfere, mind you � hardly seems necessary in your case. A writer � a
storyteller � of your stature. Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. Gimme
the broad outlines. I’m sitting in the audience, the lights go down,
Capitol logo comes up… you’re on!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, okay… well… we fade in…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …It’s a tenement building. On the Lower East
Side…</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Great! He’s poor, this wrestler! He’s had to
struggle!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: And then… well…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: CAN you? You damn well better be. Jesus, if
I hadn’t been honest in my business dealings � well, of course, you
can’t always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town �
but if you’re a writer, you don’t think about those things � if I’d been
totally honest, I wouldn’t be within a mile of this pool � unless I was
cleaning it. But that’s no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean. Not
cleaning the pool.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well… to be honest, I’m never really
comfortable discussing a work in progress. I’ve got it all worked out in
my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words � prematurely � the
wrong words � well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind,
and you never get it back � so I’d just as soon not talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never mind how long
I’ve been in pictures. Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just about since
they were invented. HE practically invented them.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: …Now I think if he’s interested in what one of
his contract employees is doing while he draws pay, I think that
employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee. Right now
the contents of your head are the property of Capitol Pictures, so if I
were you I would speak up. And pretty goddamn fast.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: You lousy sonofabitch! You’re telling this
man � this ARTIST � what to do?!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mr. Lipnik, I �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: This man creates for a living! He puts food
on your table and on mine! THANK him for it! Thank him, you ungrateful
sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU’RE fired!</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Mr. Lipnik, that’s not really necessar-</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch! Get
down on your knees and kiss this man’s feet!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Mr. Lipnik, please �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I � Mr. Lipnik �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Okay, get out of here. You’re fired, you
understand me? Get out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Mr. Lipnik, I �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: I apologize, Barton.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great
help �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: You don’t have to cover for him. It’s noble
of you, but these things happen in business.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better
if you could reconsider �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this
out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn’t apologize to you,
goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you
can’t fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your
fine efforts.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …You know in the old country we were taught,
as very young children, that there’s no shame in supplicatin’ yourself
when you respect someone.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …On behalf of Capitol Pictures, the
administration, and all a the stockholders, please accept this as a
symbol of our apology and respect.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Barton. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Jesus… You’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Have to, old timer. Just for a while.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Jesus, Charlie, I…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Everything’s okay, believe me. I know it’s
rough mentally, but everything’s taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie! I’ve got no one else here! You’re
the only person I know in Los Angeles…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …that I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s okay… It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie, I feel like I’m going crazy � like
I’m losing my mind. I don’t know what to do… I didn’t do it, believe me.
I’m sure of that, Charlie. I just…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …I just don’t know what… to do�</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta
just carry on � just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here,
keep your door locked. Don’t talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our
heads and we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah, but Charlie �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Dammit, don’t argue with me. You asked me
to believe you � well I do. Now don’t argue with me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Look, pal � can you do something for
me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Keep this for me, till I get back.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …It’s just personal stuff. I don’t wanna
drag it with me, but I don’t trust ’em downstairs, and I’d like to think
it’s in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sure, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Funny, huh, when everything that’s
important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime � when
he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess… I guess it’s kind of
pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: It’s more than I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, keep it for me. Maybe it’ll bring you
good luck. Yeah, it’ll help you finish your script. You’ll think about
me…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Make me your wrestler. Then you’ll lick
that story of yours.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Thanks, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. You’re
gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You’ll be back?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t worry about that, compadre. I’ll be
back.</p>

<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: That’s right, Fink, he lives next door
to you.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Ever talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …Once or twice. His name is Charlie
Meadows.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Yeah, and I’m Buck Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Also known as Madman Mundt.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: He’s a little funny in the head.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: What did… What did he �</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate
people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Yeah, he’s funny that way.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Started in Kansas City. Couple of
housewives.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out
in Los Feliz.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: All of which he’s now missin’.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Well, some of his throat was
there.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Physician, heal thyself.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Good luck with no fuckin’ head.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Hollywood precinct finds another stiff
yesterday. Not too far from here. This one’s better looking than the
doc.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice
tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that
description?</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: But, you know, with the head still
on.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …No. I never saw him with anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: So. You talked to Mundt, what about?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Nothing, really. Said he was in the
insurance business.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Yeah, and he’s Buck Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: No reputable company would hire a guy
like that.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well that’s what he said.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: He… I’m trying to think… Nothing, really…
He… He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say
anything you might remember could be helpful. But I’ll be frank with
you: That is not helpful.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Ya see how he’s not writing it down?</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Fink. That’s a Jewish name, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Yeah, I didn’t think this dump was
restricted.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: …Mundt has disappeared. I don’t think
he’ll be back. But…</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: …give me a call if you see him. Or if
you remember something that isn’t totally idiotic.</p>

you.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Go ahead, son.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: It’s about what I’m writing, Garland. It’s
really… I think it’s really big.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: What do you mean, Barton?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Not big in the sense of large � although
it’s that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work
I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>garland</strong>: Well, I’m… glad to hear that �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Very important, Garland. I just thought you
should know that. Whatever happens.</p>

<p><strong>barton</strong>: Keep your filthy eyes off that.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: You made morning papers, Fink.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Second one of your friends to end up
dead.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: You didn’t tell us you knew the dame.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Sixth floor too high for you,
Fink?</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Give you nose bleeds?</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where’d you
put their heads?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie… Charlie’s back…</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: No kidding, bright boy � we smelt
Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Tell us where the heads are, maybe they’ll
go easy on you.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: Only fry you once.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Could you come back later? It’s just… too
hot… My head is killing me.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: All right, forget the heads. Where’s Mundt,
Fink?</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: He teach you to do it?</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: You two have some sick sex thing?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Sex?! He’s a MAN! We WRESTLED!</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: You’re a sick fuck, Fink.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: All right, moron, you’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Charlie’s back. It’s hot… He’s back.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: …Fred…</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Sit tight, Fink.</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: Why’s it so goddamn hot out here?</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: …Fred…</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: … Show yourself, Mundt!</p>
<p><strong>deutsch</strong>: …Mundt!</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: There’s a boy, Mundt. Put the policy
case down and your mitts in the air.</p>
<p><strong>mastrionotti</strong>: He’s complying.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Heil Hitler.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Barton!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Brother, is it hot.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How you been, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Don’t look at me like that, neighbor. It’s
just me � Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I hear it’s Mundt. Madman Mundt.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jesus, people can be cruel…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …if it’s not my build, it’s my
personality.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …They say I’m a madman, Barton, but I’m not
mad at anyone. Honest I’m not. Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It
tears me up inside, to think about what they’re going through. How
trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for ’em. So I try and help
them out…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels like,
when things get all balled up at the head office. It puts you through
hell, Barton. So I help people out. I just wish someone would do as much
for me…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Jesus it’s hot. Sometimes it gets so hot,
I wanna crawl right out of my skin.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: But Charlie � why me? Why �</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Because you DON’T LISTEN!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Jesus, I’m dripping again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …C’mon Barton, you think you know about
pain? You think I made your life hell? Take a look around this dump.
You’re just a tourist with a typewriter, Barton. I live here. Don’t you
understand that…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …And you come into MY home… And you
complain that I’M making too… much… noise.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t be.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m getting off the merry-go-round.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …I’ll be next door if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Oh, I dropped in on your folks. And Uncle
Dave?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: …Good people. By the way, that package I
gave you? I lied. It isn’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- five
Fulton Street!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I understand that, sir �</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Or Uncle Dave!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I understand that, sir, but there’s still
no answer. Shall I check for trouble on the line?</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Fink.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Mr. Lipnik.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Colonel Lipnik, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …Siddown.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …I was commissioned yesterday in the Army
Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He’s a dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Actually it hasn’t officially gone through
yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything
done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but
now it’s all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.
They’d love to see me sit this one out.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yes sir, they �</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Anyway, I had Lou read your script for
me.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: …I gotta tell you, Fink. It won’t wash.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: With all due respect, sir, I think it’s the
best work I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Don’t gas me, Fink. If you’re opinion
mattered, then I guess I’d resign and let YOU run the the studio. It
doesn’t and you won’t, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS
particular asylum. So let’s put a stop to THAT rumor right now.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: I had to call Beery this morning, let him
know we were pushing the picture back. After all I’d told him about
quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally
was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was � well, I didn’t
actually call him, Lou did. But that’s a fair description, isn’t it
Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Hell, I could take you through it step by
step, explain why your story stinks, but I won’t insult your
intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture;
the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it.
They don’t wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul � well, all right, a
little bit, for the critics � but you make it the carrot that wags the
dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don’t blame ’em.
There’s plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at “Hell Ten
Feet Square”.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: “Blood, Sweat, and Canvas”.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: Look at “Blood, Sweat, and Canvas”. These
are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights � both physically and
mentally. But especially physically. We don’t put Wallace Beery in some
fruity movie about suffering � I thought we were together on that.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I’m sorry if I let you down.</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: You didn’t let ME down. Or even Lou. We
don’t live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down.
He liked you. Trusted you. And that’s why he’s gone. Fired. That guy had
a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince
me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you’re under
contract and you’re gonna stay that way. Anything you write will be the
property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce
anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain’t no writer,
Fink � you’re a goddamn write-off.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I tried to show you something beautiful.
Something about all of</p>
<p><strong>lipnik</strong>: You arrogant sonofabitch! You think you’re
the only writer who can give me that Barton Fink feeling?! I got twenty
writers under contract that I can ask for a Finktype thing from. You
swell-headed hypocrite! You just don’t get it, do you? You think the
whole world revolves inside whatever rattles inside that little kike
head of yours. Get him outta my sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in town,
though; he’s still under contract. I want you in town, Fink, and outta
my sight. Now get lost. There’s a war on.</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: I said it’s a beautiful day…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Yes… It is…</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: What’s in the box?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: Isn’t it yours?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: …You’re very beautiful. Are you in
pictures?</p>
<p><strong>beauty</strong>: Don’t be silly.</p>
