<p><strong>fade out</strong>: credits</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: There’s an old joke. Uh, two elderly women are
at a Catskills mountain resort, and one of ‘em says: “Boy, the food at
this place is really terrible.” The other one says, “Yeah, I know, and
such … small portions.” Well, that’s essentially how I feel about life.
Full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness, and it’s
all over much too quickly. The-the other important joke for me is one
that’s, uh, usually attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think it appears
originally in Freud’s wit and its relation to the unconscious. And it
goes like this-I’m paraphrasing: Uh … “I would never wanna belong to any
club that would have someone like me for a member.” That’s the key joke
of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women. Tsch, you
know, lately the strangest things have been going through my mind,
’cause I turned forty, tsch, and I guess I’m going through a life crisis
or something, I don’t know. I, uh … and I’m not worried about aging. I’m
not one o’ those characters, you know. Although I’m balding slightly on
top, that’s about the worst you can say about me. I, uh, I think I’m
gonna get better as I get older, you know? I think I’m gonna be the- the
balding virile type, you know, as opposed to say the, uh, distinguished
gray, for instance, you know? ‘Less I’m neither o’ those two. Unless I’m
one o’ those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders
into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism. Annie
and I broke up and I-I still can’t get my mind around that. You know,
I-I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and-and
examining my life and tryin’ to figure out where did the screw-up come,
you know, and a year ago we were… tsch, in love. You know, and-and-and …
And it’s funny, I’m not-I’m not a morose type. I’m not a depressive
character. I-I-I, uh, you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, I guess. I
was brought up in Brooklyn during World War II.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s been depressed. All off a sudden, he
can’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Why are you depressed, Alvy?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Tell Dr. Flicker. It’s something he
read.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Something he read, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: The universe is expanding.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The universe is expanding?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, the universe is everything, and if it’s
expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of
everything!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What is that your business? He stopped doing
his homework.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What has the universe got to do with it?
You’re here in Brooklyn! Brooklyn is not expanding!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It won’t be expanding for billions of years
yet, Alvy. And we’ve gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we’re here.
Uh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: My analyst says I exaggerate my
childhood memories, but I swear I was brought up underneath the
roller-</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: -coaster in the Coney Island section
of Brooklyn. Maybe that accounts for my personality, which is a little
nervous, I think.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: You know, I have a hyperactive
imagination. My mind tends to jump around a little, and have some
trouble between fantasy and reality.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: My father ran the bumper-car
concession. driving a bumper car. He stops as other cars bombard him.
His father continues There-there he is and there I am. But I-I-I-I used
to get my aggression out through those cars all the time.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: I remember the staff at our public
school. You know, we had a saying, uh, that “Those who can’t do, teach,
and those who can’t teach, teach gym.” And …uh, h’h, of course, those
who couldn’t do anything, I think, were assigned to our school. I must
say-</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: I always felt my schoolmates were
idiots. Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little face, and Henrietta
Farrell, just Miss Perfect all the time. And-and Ivan Ackerman, always
the wrong answer. Always.</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Seven and three is nine.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Even then I knew they were just jerks.
In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-</p>
<p><strong>1st girl</strong>: Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: That’s the second time this month! Step up
here!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Step up here!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: camera moves over to the back of the Why, I
was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Six-year-old boys don’t have girls on their
minds.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>1st girl</strong>: For God’s sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks
of a latency period.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I never had a latency period. I can’t
help it.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Why couldn’t you have been more like
Donald? sitting up tall in his seat, then Now, there was a model
boy!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tell the folks where you are today,
Donald.</p>
<p><strong>donald</strong>: I run a profitable dress company.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Right. Sometimes I wonder where my
classmates are today.</p>
<p><strong>1st boy</strong>: I’m president of the Pinkus Plumbing
Company.</p>
<p><strong>2nd boy</strong>: I sell tallises.</p>
<p><strong>3rd boy</strong>: I used to be a heroin addict. Now I’m a
methadone addict.</p>
<p><strong>2nd girl</strong>: I’m into leather.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I lost track of most of my old schoolmates,
but I wound up a comedian. They did not take me in the Army. I was, uh …
Interestingly enough, I was-I was four-P.</p>
<p><strong>dick cavett</strong>: Four-P?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yes. In-in-in-in the event of war, I’m a
hostage.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You always only saw the worst in people. You
never could get along with anyone at school. You were always outta step
with the world. Even when you got famous, you still distrusted the
world.’</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his
breath, “Jew.”</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I’m not. We were walking off the tennis
court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at
her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said,
“Jew.”</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Alvy, you’re a total paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on
those kind o’ things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from
NBC, so I said … uh, “Did you eat yet or what?” and Tom Christie said,
“No, didchoo?” Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but
Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Ah, Max, you, uh …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Stop calling me Max.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Why, Max? It’s a good name for you. Max, you
see conspiracies in everything.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I don’t! You know, I was in a record
store. Listen to this -so I know there’s this big tall blond crew-cutted
guy and he’s lookin’ at me in a funny way and smiling and he’s saying,
“Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner.” Wagner, Max, Wagner-so I know
what he’s really tryin’ to tell me very significantly Wagner.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Right, Max. California, Max.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Let’s get the hell outta this crazy city.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Forget it, Max.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: -we move to sunny L.A. All of show business is
out there, Max.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I
don’t wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you
can make a right turn on a red light.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Right, Max, forget it. Aren’t you gonna be late
for meeting Annie?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I
think I have a few minutes left. Right?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Hey, you on television?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like
occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You wouldn’t know it. It doesn’t matter.
What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: You were on … uh, the … uh, the Johnny
Carson, right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know,
every now-</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m … I’m, uh, I’m Robert Redford.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Alvy Singer. It was nice nice … Thanks very
much … for everything.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: This is Alvy Singer!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Fellas … you know-Jesus! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: This guy’s on television! Alvy Singer,
right? Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus
Christ!</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: This guy’s on television.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I need a large polo mallet!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Who’s on television?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Fellas, what is this-a meeting o’ the
teamsters? You know.. .</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: What program?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Can I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You don’t want my autograph.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Yeah, I do. It’s for my girl friend. Make
it out to Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Your girl friend’s name is Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: It’s for my brudder. Alvy Singer! Hey! This
is Alvy-</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: You really Alvy Singer, the … the TV
star?</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: -Singer!</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: Alvy Singer over here!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I-i-i-i-it’s all right, fellas. two men still
behind him, Annie Jesus, what’d you do, come by way of the Panama
Canal?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alright, alright, I’m in a bad mood,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Bad mood? I’m standing with the cast of “The
Godfather.”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re gonna hafta learn to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Deal! I’m dealing with two guys named
Cheech!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay. still talking. A billboard next to them
reads “INGMAR BERGMAN’S ’FACE</p>
<p>****: Please, I have a headache, all right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must
be getting your period.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m not getting my period. Jesus, every time
anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I’m getting my
period!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: A li-little louder. I think one of them may
have missed it! H’m, has the picture started yet?</p>
<p><strong>ticket clerk</strong>: It started two minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s it! Forget it! I-I can’t go in.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Two minutes, Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I’m sorry, I can’t do it. We-we’ve blown
it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can’t go in in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: In the middle? We’ll only miss the titles.
They’re in Swedish.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You wanna get coffee for two hours or
something? We’ll go next-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Two hours? No, u-uh, I’m going in. I’m going
in.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Go ahead. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Look, while we’re talking we could be inside,
you know that?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front
of everybody, ’cause I get embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you
wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know now. You-you wanna go to another
movie? her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, gesturing with his band, looks
at So let’s go see The Sorrow and the Pity.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, come on, we’ve seen it. I’m not in the
mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, I-I can’t … I-I-I’ve gotta
see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, ’cause-’cause I’m
anal.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: H’h, that’s a polite word for what you
are.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.
It is not one of his best. It lacks a cohesive structure. You know, you
get the feeling that he’s not absolutely sure what it is he wants to
say. ’Course, I’ve always felt he was essentially a-a technical film
maker. Granted, La Strada was a great film. Great in its use of negative
energy more than anything else. But that simple cohesive core …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m-I’m-I’m gonna have a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, stop listening to him.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: You know, it must need to have had its
leading from one thought to another. You know what I’m talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: He’s screaming his opinions in my ear.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or
Satyricon, I found it incredibly … indulgent. You know, he really is.
He’s one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Key word here is “indulgent.”</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: -without getting … well, let’s put it
this way …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: overlapping the man in line who is What are
you depressed about?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I missed my therapy. I overslept.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: How can you possibly oversleep?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The alarm clock.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know what a hostile gesture that is to
me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know-because of our sexual problem,
right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, you … everybody in line at the New Yorker
has to know our rate of intercourse?</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: - It’s like Samuel Beckett, you know- I
admire the technique but he doesn’t … he doesn’t hit me on a gut
level.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’d like to hit this guy on a gut level.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Stop it, Alvy!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, he’s spitting on my neck! You know, he’s
spitting on my neck when he talks.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: And then, the most important thing of
all is a comedian’s vision.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And you know something else? You know, you’re
so egocentric that if I miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of
how it affects you!</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Gal gun-shy is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Probably on their first date, right?</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: It’s a narrow view.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Probably met by answering an ad in the New
York Review of Books. “Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who’s
interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy.” Whatta you mean, our
sexual problem?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I-I-I mean, I’m comparatively normal for a guy
raised in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay, I’m very sorry. My sexual problem!
Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I never read that. That was-that was Henry
James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual
…</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: It’s the influence of television. Yeah,
now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh,
high intensity, you understand? A hot medium … as opposed to a …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What I wouldn’t give for a large sock o’ horse
manure.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: … as opposed to a print …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What do you do when you get stuck in a movie
line with a guy like this behind you? I mean, it’s just maddening!</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Wait a minute, why can’t I give my
opinion? It’s a free country!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give
it so loud? I mean, aren’t you ashamed to pontificate like that? And-and
the funny part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don’t know anything
about Marshall McLuhan’s…work!</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen
to teach a class at Columbia called “TV Media and Culture”! So I think
that my insights into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of
validity.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, do yuh?</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, that’s funny, because I happen to have
Mr. McLuhan right here. So … so, here, just let me-I mean, all right.
Come over here … a second.</p>
<p><strong>man in line</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>mcluhan</strong>: I hear-I heard what you were saying.
You-you know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How
you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Boy, if life were only like this!</p>
<p><strong>marcel ophuls, andre harris, 1969</strong>: Chronicle of a
French town during the Occupation</p>
<p><strong>narrator’s voice</strong>: June fourteenth, nineteen forty,
the German army occupies Paris. All over the country, people are
desperate for every available scrap of news.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were
really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so
much.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’m, I don’t know, sometimes I ask myself how
I’d stand up under torture.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You? You kiddin’? the bed to touch, Annie, who
makes a If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale’s charge card,
you’d tell ’em everything.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That movie makes me feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, ’cause it’s supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, I …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What-what-what-what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I-you know, I don’t wanna.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What-what-I don’t … It’s not natural! We’re
sleeping in a bed together. You know, it’s been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know, well, it’s just that-you know, I
mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s always some kind of an excuse. It’s- You
know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What … When we first
started going out, we had sex constantly … We’re- we’re probably listed
in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know. Well, Alvy, it’ll pass, it’ll pass,
it’s just that I’m going through a phase, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’m.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I mean, you’ve been married before, you know
how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Ma’am, you’re on right after this man …
about twenty minutes, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Excuse … excuse me, when do I go on?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Alvy … Alvy Singer. I’m a comedian.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh … you’re on
next.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What do you mean, next?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Uh … I mean you’re on right after this
act.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, it can’t be, because he’s a comic.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So what are you telling me, you’re putting on
two comics in a row?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I’m sorry, I’m not goin’- I can’t … I
don’t wanna go on after that comedian.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, because they’re-they’re laughing, so
I-I-I’d rather not. If you don’t mind, I prefer-</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Will you relax, please? They’re gonna love
you, I know.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I prefer not to, because … look, they’re
laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -that I’ve got to … ah … ah … They’re gonna
laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta …
get laughs, too. How much can they laugh? They-they they’re laughed
out.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Do you feel all right?</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: You know …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look, what’s your-what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: … General Eisenhower is not …</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Allison.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah? Allison what?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Portchnik.</p>
<p><strong>comedian</strong>: … a group from the …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Thank you. I-I don’t know why they would have
me at this kind of rally ’cause … Excuse me, I’m not essentially a
political comedian at all.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I … interestingly had, uh, dated … a woman in
the Eisenhower Administration … briefly … and, uh, it was ironic to me
’cause, uh . . . tsch . . . ’cause I was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her
what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight
years.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: H’m, I’m sorry, I can’t go through with this,
because it-I can’t get it off my mind, Allison … it’s obsessing me!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Well, I’m getting tired of it. I need your
attention.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It-but it-it … doesn’t make any sense. He
drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it
was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from
two angles at once? It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’ll tell you this! He was not marksman enough
to hit a moving target at that range. But … if there was a second
assassin … it- That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: We’ve been through this.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: If they-they recovered the shells from that
rifle.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now?
That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this
conspiracy, right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, why not?</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Yeah, Earl Warren?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey … honey, I don’t know Earl Warren.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Lyndon Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a
politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It’s like-uh, a notch
underneath child molester.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: Then everybody’s in in the conspiracy?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover
and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men’s-room attendant at the
White House?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I-I-I-I would leave out the men’s-room
attendant.</p>
<p><strong>allison</strong>: You’re using this conspiracy theory as an
excuse to avoid sex with me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, my God! She’s right! Why did I turn off
Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was
real … intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just
don’t wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a
member?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, now don’t panic. Please.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look, I told you it was a … mistake to ever
bring a live thing in the house.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Stop it! Don’t … don’t do that! There.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, maybe we should just call the police.
Dial nine-one-one, it’s the lobster squad.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Come on, Alvy, they’re only baby ones, for
God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: If they’re only babies, then you pick ’em
up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, all right. All right! It’s all right.
Here.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Don’t give it to me. Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oooh! Here! Here!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look! Look, one crawled behind the
refrigerator. It’ll turn up in our bed at night. Alvy moves as close to
the wall as possible as Annie, covering her mouth and laughing
hysterically, teasingly Will you get outta here with that thing?
Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Talk to him. You speak shellfish! takes the
lid of a large steamer Hey, look … put it in the pot.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I can’t! I can’t put him in the pot. I can’t
put a live thing in hot water.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What-what’s he
think we’re gonna do, take him to the movies?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he’ll
think- Aaaah! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Okay, it’s in. It’s definitely in the pot!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: All right. All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Annie, there’s a big lobster behind the
refrigerator. I can’t get it out. This thing’s heavy. Maybe if I put a
little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the
other side, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. I’m gonna get my … I’m gonna get my
camera.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know, I-I think … if I could pry this door
off … We shoulda gotten steaks ’cause they don’t have legs. They don’t
run around.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Great! Great! Goddammit! Ooooh! These are …
p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: All right! All right! All right! All right!
Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’ll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it’ll be
wonderful … Ooooh, lovely!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: All right, here! Oh, God, it’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t be a jerk. One more, Alvy, please, one
more picture. lobster again as Annie takes Oh, oh, good, good!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So, so-well, here’s what I wanna know. W-what
… Am I your first big romance?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh … no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, then, w-who was?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, well, let’s see, there was Dennis, from
Chippewa Falls High School.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Dennis-right, uh, uh … local kid
probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday
night.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice</strong>: Oh, God, you should’ve seen what I
looked like then.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the
wife of an astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice</strong>: Then there was Jerry, the actor.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Look at you, you-you,-re such a
clown.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice</strong>: I look pretty.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Well, yeah, you always look pretty,
but that guy with you …</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Acting is like an exploration of the soul.
I-it’s very religious. Uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness.
It’s like a visual poem.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Is he kidding with that crap?</p>
<p><strong>younger annie</strong>: Oh, right. Right, yeah, I think I
know exactly what you mean, when you say “religious.”</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, that was last year.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s like when I think of dying. You know how
I would like to die?</p>
<p><strong>younger annie</strong>: No, how?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’d like to get torn apart by wild
animals.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice</strong>: Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific
actor, and look at him, he’s neat-looking and he was emotional … Y-hey,
I don’t think you like emotion too much.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Touch my heart … with your foot.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: I-I may throw up!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: He was creepy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I-I think you’re pretty lucky I came
along.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that
I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like “la-de-da” . .
.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, that’s right. That you really like those
New York girls.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, no … not just, not only.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I’d say so. You married-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -two of them.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There’s Henry Drucker. He has a chair in
history at Princeton. Oh, the short man is Hershel Kaminsky. He has a
chair in philosophy at Cornell.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, two more chairs and they got a
dining-room set.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Why are you so hostile?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: ’Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on
television.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the
host because he’s publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. “A
Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart.”</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m so tired of spending evenings making fake
insights with people who work for Dysentery.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Commentary.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and
Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No jokes-these are friends, okay?</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New
York Knicks.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Here you are. There’s people out there.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, you wouldn’t believe this. Two minutes
ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now … they’re ahead two
points.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of
pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’s fascinating is that it’s physical. You
know, it’s one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be
absolutely brilliant and have no idea what’s going on. But on the other
hand … the body doesn’t lie, as-as we now know.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Stop acting out.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, it’ll be great! It’ll be great, be-because
all those Ph.D.’s are in there, you know, like … discussing models of
alienation and we’ll be in here quietly humping.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Alvy, don’t! You’re using sex to express
hostility.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: “‘Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal
urges to psychoanalytic categories?’ he said as he removed her
brassiere…”</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There are people out there from The New
Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Don’t get upset!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Dammit! I was so close.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his
car horn. I mean, the city can’t close down. You know, what-whatta yuh
gonna do, h-have ’em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we
can have sex?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst
says I should live in the country and not in New York.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I can’t li- We can’t have this
discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There’s … You got
crickets and it-it’s quiet … there’s no place to walk after dinner, and…
uh, there’s the screens with the dead moths behind them, and… uh, yuh
got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I’m too
tense. Where’s the goddamn Valium?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, come on, it’s quiet now. We can-we can
start again.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What-</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: My head is throbbing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, you got a headache!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Bad?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Oswald and ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I’m-I’m gonna take another in a series
of cold showers.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the
showers-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Right, right, so g-get back to what we were
discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is
anti-Semitism.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Max, the city is terribly worried.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: But the- I’m not discussing politics or
economics. This is foreskin.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No, no, no, Max, that’s a very convenient out.
Every time some group disagrees with you it’s because of
anti-Semitism.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Don’t you see? The rest of the country looks
upon New York like we’re-we’re left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual,
pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Max, if we lived in California, we could play
outdoors every day, in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents
said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know, but ooh- here he comes. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You know Alvy?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Oh, hi, Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How are yuh?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You know Annie?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m sorry. This is Annie Hall.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Who’s playing who here? Alvy Well, uh … you and
me against them?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well … so … I can’t play too good, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ve had four lessons!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Holy gods!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hi. Hi, hi.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly
toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You-you play … very well.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta- whatta
dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, “You play well,” and right
away … I have to say well. Oh, oh … God, Annie. Well … oh, well …
la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh … you-you wanna lift?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, why-uh … y-y-you gotta car?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, um … I was gonna take a cab.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, no, I have a car.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You have a car? So … I don’t understand why …
if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say “Do you have a car?”…
like you wanted a lift?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t … I don’t … Geez, I don’t know, I’ve

you like a lift?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin’?</p>

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, well, I’m goin’ uptown, too.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh, well, you just said you were going
downtown.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m, but I …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So sorry.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown,
but … uh, what the hell, I mean, it’d be nice having company, you know I
mean, I hate driving alone.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you
know her from?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I’m in her acting class.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh - you’re an actress.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I do commercials, sort of …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I, uh … well, you’re not from New York,

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sylvia Plath.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm…</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was
misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Right. Well, I don’t know, I mean, uh, some
of her poems seem - neat, you know.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Neat?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Neat, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen
seventy-five, you know that “neat” went out, I would say, at the turn of
the century. Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh … oh, well, you see now now, uh, that’s my
dad, that’s Father-and that’s my … brother, Duane.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Duane?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy
Hall, and that’s Sadie.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, who’s Sadie?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie… Sadie met Grammy
through, uh, through Grammy’s brother George. Uh, George was real sweet,
you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where
you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it?
Uh …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh, narcolepsy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway,
so … George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey,
be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at
Christmas time because he was … side of her head, indicating George
shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. a cabinet
door and takes out a Anyway, so, so … George is standing in line, oh,
just a sec …uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls
asleep and he never wakes up. So, so… so, he’s dead … he’s dead. Yeah.
Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn’t you say? I mean, that’s pretty
unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, it’s a great story, though, I mean, I… I
… it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know,
’cause I think I’m imposing, you know …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, really? Oh, well … uh, uh, maybe, uh,
maybe, we, uh …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: … and … uh, yeah, uh … uh, you know,
I-I-I…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I mean, you don’t have to, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I know, but … but, you know, I’m all
perspired and everything.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, didn’t you take, uh … uh, a shower at
the club?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Me? No, no, no, ’cause I never shower in a
public place.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: ’Cause I don’t like to get naked in front of
another man, you know-it’s, uh …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I see, I see.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know, I don’t like to show my body to a
man of my gender-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -’cause, uh, you never know what’s gonna
happen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Fifteen years, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Fifteen years, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Oh, God bless!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: God bless.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, uh … You’re what Grammy Hall would call
a real Jew.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, well … you-She hates Jews. She thinks
that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she’s the one
yeah, is she ever. I’m tellin’ yuh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So, did you do shoot the photographs in there
or what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: They’re … they’re… they’re wonderful, you
know. They have … they have, uh … a … a quality.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take a
serious photography course soon.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Photography’s interesting, ’cause, you know,
it’s-it’s a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have
not emerged yet.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Aesthetic criteria? You mean, whether it’s,
uh, good photo or not?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: The-the medium enters in as a condition of the
art form itself. That’s-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, well, I … to me-I … I mean,
it’s-it’s-it’s all instinctive, you know. I mean, I just try to uh, feel
it, you know? I try to get a sense of it and not think about it so
much.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Still, still we- You need a set of aesthetic
guide lines to put it in social perspective, I think.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I don’t know. I mean, I guess-I guess
you must be sorta late, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know, I gotta get there and begin whining
soon … otherwise I- Hey … well, are you busy Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Me? Oh, uh. No.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, wait a minute, I have

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh … nothing. Not-no, no!</p>

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -what I mean?</p>

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, so help me.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -it’s my first time.</p>

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -you’re gonna like night clubs, they’re really
a lotta fun.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I was awful. I’m so ashamed! I can’t
sing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad
restless.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God,
I mean, they hated me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, they didn’t. You have a wonderful
voice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I’m gonna quit!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I’m not gonna letcha. You have a great
voice.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really, do you think so, really?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, you know something? I never even took a
lesson, either.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, listen, listen.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Gimme a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, why not, because we’re just gonna go
home later, right?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: And-and uh, there’s gonna be all that tension.
You know, we never kissed before and I’ll never know when to make the
right move or anything. So we’ll kiss now we’ll get it over with and
then we’ll go eat. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: And we’ll digest our food better.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So now we can digest our food.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We can digest our-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m gonna have a corned beef.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah … oh, uh, and I’m gonna have a pastrami
on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. Tsch, so,
uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about
that?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn’t
cure.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. And your first wife was Allison?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: My first… Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh,
it was my fault. I was just… I was too crazy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’m, that was so nice. That was nice.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: As Balzac said …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: H’m?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: “There goes another novel.”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I’m-I’m-I’m a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. You’re a wreck.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Really. I mean it. I-I’ll never play the piano
again.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re really nuts. I don’t know, you really
thought it was good? Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Good? I was-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, that was the most fun I’ve ever had
without laughing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here, you want some?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don’t use any major
hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party
and</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -tried to take my pants off over my head … …
my ear.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, I don’t really. I don’t do
it very often, you know, just sort of, er … relaxes me at first.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’hm. You’re not gonna believe this, but-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: H’m?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I-I-I’m gonna buy you these books, I think,
because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat
book.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s, uh … that’s pretty serious stuff
there.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, ’cause I-I’m, you know, I’m, I’m
obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -big subject with me, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’ve a very pessimistic view of life. You
should know this about me if we’re gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel
that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Those are the two categories …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: … you know, they’re- The-the horrible would be
like, uh, I don’t know, terminal cases, you know?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: And blind people, crippled …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t-don’t know how they get through</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know, and the miserable is everyone else.
That’s-that’s all. So-so when you go through life you should be thankful
that you’re miserable, because that’s- You’re very lucky … to be … … to
be miserable.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: U-huh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look, look at that guy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: There’s-there’s-there’s-there’s
Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know? He’s the latest!
just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look at these guys.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, that’s hilarious. They’re back from Fire
Island. They’re … they’re sort of giving it a chance-you know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh! Italian, right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, he’s the Mafia. Linen Supply
Business</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, I’m serious. I just got my mustache
wet.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: And there’s the winner of the Truman Capote
look-alike contest.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You see, like you and I …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You are extremely sexy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because … you
know what you are? You’re-you’re polymorphously perverse.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what does-what does that mean? I don’t
know what that is.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh … uh, you’re-you’re exceptional in bed
because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I
touch you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Ooooh!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know what I mean? Like the tip o’your
nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps … you get excited.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Come on. Yeah. You know what? You know, I
like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You- Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Do I love you?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s the key question.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I know you’ve only known me a short while.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I certainly … I think that’s very-
Yeah, yeah … yeah. Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for
what…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: - I … I love you. You know I lo-ove you, I-I
love you. I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Don’t you think I do?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whatta you mean? You’re not gonna give up your
own apartment, are you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, bu-bu-but why?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I mean, I’m moving in with you, that’s
why.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I have a tiny apartment.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I know it’s small.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s right, and it’s got bad plumbing and
bugs.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and
bugs, but you-you say that like it’s a negative thing. You know, bugs
are-are-uh, entomology is a … suitcases and some loose clothing onto the
bed. She sits down on the edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, pictures
and carton in band, still … rapidly growing field.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You don’t want me to live with you?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: How- I don’t want you to live with me? How-
Whose idea was it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Ye-ah. Was it … It was yours actually, but,
uh, I approved it immediately.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I guess you think that I talked you into
something, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No-what, what …? I … we live together, we
sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don’t want it to be like
we’re married, do yuh?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: How is it any different?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s different ’cause you keep your own
apartment. Because you know it’s there, we don’t have to go to it, we
don’t have to deal with it, but it’s like a-a-a free-floating life raft
… that we know that we’re not married.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That little apartment is four hundred dollars
a month, Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That place is four hundred dollars a
month?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s-it’s got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus,
I’ll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I’ll pay for
it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You don’t think I’m smart enough to be
serious about.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Then why are you always pushing me to take
those college courses like I was dumb or something?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: ’Cause adult education’s a wonderful thing.
You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it’s stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Does this sound like a good course? Uh,
“Modern American Poetry”? Uh, or, uh-let’s see now … maybe I should, uh,
take “Introduction to the Novel.”</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Just don’t take any course where they make you
read Beowulf.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What? Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do
you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, don’t be silly. What-what do we need other
people for? kissing her, Annie making muffled You know, we should-we
should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or
something.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, okay. Well, listen, I’m gonna get a
cigarette, okay?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will
make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, have you ever made love high?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Me, no. You … I-I-you know, if I have grass or
alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful
for words. You know, I don’t-I don’t know why you have to, uh, get high
every time we make love.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It relaxes me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed
before we can go to bed?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what’s the difference, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I’ll give you a shot of sodium
pentothal. You can sleep through it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, come on, look who’s talking. You’ve been
seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o’ this.
You’d be off the couch in no time.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, come, you don’t need that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, no, no, what … You can once, you can live
without it once. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.
M’mrnm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’m, wait, I got a great idea. closet, taking
out a light bulb. He goes back to the bed and turns Hang in there for a
second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact,
that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be
perfect. replaced the bulb with the red one I just … there … There’s a
little Old New Orleans … essence. Now-now we can go about our business
here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now
there. M’mmm. M’mmm. Hey, is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know. You- It’s like you’re- you’re
removed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: U-huh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know, but you seem sort of
distant.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Let’s just do it, all right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Is it my imagination or are you just going
through the motions?</p>
<p><strong>annie’s spirit</strong>: Alvy, do you remember where I put my
drawing pad? Because while you two are doing that, I think I’m gonna do
some drawing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You see, that’s what I call removed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, you have my body.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, but that’s not-that’s no good. I want
the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I need grass and so do you.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass
because, you know, I’m, like, a comedian-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -so if I get a laugh from a person who’s high,
it doesn’t count. You know-‘cause they’re always laughin’.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Were you always funny?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, what is this-an interview? We’re supposed
to be making love.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: This guy is naturally funny. I think he can
write for you.</p>
<p><strong>comic</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Hey, kid, he tells me you’re
really good. Well, lemme explain a little bit o’ how I work. You know,
you can tell right off the bat that I don’t look like a funny guy when I
come-you know, like some o’ the guys that come out. You know, right away
they’re gonna tell yuh their stories, you’re gonna fall down, but I
gotta be really talented. Material’s gotta be sensational for me ‘cause
I work, you know, with very, very … Come on, I’m kinda classy, you know
what I mean? Uh … uh … lemme explain. For instance, I open with an
opening song. A musical start like and I walk out “Place looks wonderful
from here and you folks look wonderful from here!”And seein’ you there
With a smile on your face Makes me shout This must be the place.” Then I
stop right in the middle and then I open with some jokes. Now, that’s
where I need you, right there. For instance, like I say, “Hey, I just
got back from Canada, you know, they speak a lotta French up there. The
only way to remember Jeanne d’Arc means the light’s out in the
bathroom!” “Oh, I met a big lumberjack …”</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Jesus, this guy’s pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>comic</strong>: … big lumberjack …</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: Look at him mincing around, like he
thinks he’s real cute. You wanna throw up. If only I had the nerve to do
my own jokes. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this smile frozen
on my face. I’m in the wrong business, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>comic</strong>: “‘Cherie, come back. I love you. But, uh,
Cheri, what will I do with this, uh?’ He says, ‘Aw, Marie, sometime you
make me so mad.”’ Oh, they scream at that. Now, write me somethin’ like
that, will yuh? Kinda French number, can yuh do it? Huh, kid?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: W-where am I? I-I keep … I have to reorient
myself. This is the University of Wisconsin, right? So I’m always … I’m
tense and … uh, when I’m playin’ a col- I’ve a very bad history with
colleges. You know, I went to New York University and, uh, tsch, I was
thrown out of NYU my freshman year … for cheating on my metaphysics
final. You know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me-
-and when I was thrown out, my mother, who’s an emotionally high-strung
woman, locked herself in the bathroom and took an overdose of mah-jongg
tiles. And, uh, tsch, I was depressed. I was … in analysis, I-I, uh, was
suicidal; as a matter of fact, uh, I would have killed myself but I was
in analysis with a strict Freudian and if you kill yourself … they make
you pay for the sessions you miss.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, you were … Alvy, you were just great,
I’m not kidding. It was- You were so neat.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: C-c-coll- College audiences are so
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think
that I’m starting to get more of your references, too.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Are yuh?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, the twelve o’clock show is completely
different than the nine.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: May I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You’re so sure about it.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I’m really, uh, looking forward to
tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it’ll be really nice to meet
Mother and Father.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I know, they’ll hate me immediately.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I don’t think so. No, I don’t think
they’re gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s Easter. You know, we’ll have a nice
dinner, we’ll sit down and eat. I think they’re gonna really like
you.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: It’s a nice ham this year, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah. Grammy always does such a good
job.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: A great sauce.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It is. It’s dynamite ham.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram
and I. Got some nice picture frames.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We really had a good time.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Ann tells us that you’ve been seeing a
psychiatrist for fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yes. I’m making excellent progress. Pretty
soon when I lie down on his couch, I won’t have to wear the lobster
bib.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: Duane and I went out to the boat
basin.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: We were caulkin’ holes all day.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: Yeah. Randolph Hunt was drunk, as
usual.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy
Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I can’t believe this family. Annie’s mother.
She really’s beautiful. And they’re talkin’ swap meets and boat basins,
and the old lady at the end of the table is a classic Jew hater. And,
uh, they, they realty look American, you know, very healthy and … like
they never get sick or anything. Nothing like my family. You know, the
two are like oil and water.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: Let ’im drop dead! Who needs his
business?!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: His wife has diabetes!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse?
Diabetes?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s uncle</strong>: The man is fifty years old and doesn’t
have a substantial job.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s aunt</strong>: Is that a reason to steal from his
father?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s uncle</strong>: Whatta you talkin’ about? You don’t
know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s aunt</strong>: Yes, I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: George, defend him!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s uncle</strong>: No Moskowitz he had a coronary.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s aunt</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: We fast.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Stupid Thelma Poindexter … to the Veterans
Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: My God, he’s the new president of the El
Regis. Let me tell you, the man is somethin’ else.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: That’s Jack’s wife. We used to make that
outta raisins.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yes, that’s right. Did you see the new
play?</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Oh, you remember her, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: How do you plan to spend the holidays,
Mrs. Singer?</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: Fast?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: Yeah, no food. You know, we have to
atone for our sins.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: What sins? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: Tell you the truth, neither do
we.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, hi, Duane, how’s it goin’?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: This is my room.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, yeah? Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Can I confess something?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: I tell you this because, as an artist, I
think you’ll understand. Sometimes when I’m driving … on the road at
night … I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden
impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can
anticipate the explosion. The sound of shattering glass. The … flames
rising out of the flowing gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go
now, Duane, because I-I’m due back on the planet earth.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Now, don’t let it be so long, now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: And look up Uncle Bill, you promise.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: Oh, he’s adorable, Annie.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You think so? Do you really?</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: We’re going to take them to the
airport.</p>
<p><strong>dad hall</strong>: Oh, no-Duane can. I haven’t finished my
drink.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes, Duane is. I’ll be right-</p>
<p><strong>mom hall</strong>: M’mmm.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I just have time to get the, uh-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You followed me. I can’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I didn’t follow you!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You followed me!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Why? ‘Cause I … was walkin’ along a block
behind you staring at you? That’s not following!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what is your definition of
following?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Following is different. I was spying.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Do you realize how paranoid you are?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Paranoid? I’m looking at you. You got your
arms around another guy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That is the worst kind of paranoia.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah-well, I didn’t start out spying. I-I
thought I’d surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the
relationship flexible, remember? It’s your phrase.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair
with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap
course “Contemporary Crisis in Western Man”!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: “Existential Motifs in Russian Literature”!
You’re really close.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’s the difference? It’s all mental
masturbation.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, well, now we’re finally getting to a
subject you know something about!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, don’t knock masturbation! It’s sex with
someone I love.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We’re not having an affair. He’s married. He
just happens to think I’m neat.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: “Neat”! There’s that- What are you-twelve
years old? That’s one o’ your Chippewa Falls expressions! “He thinks I’m
neat.”</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Who cares? Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Next thing you know he’ll find you keen and
peachy, you know? Next thing you know he’s got his hand on your ass!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’ve always had hostility toward David ever
since I mentioned him!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: David? You call your teacher David?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s his name.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, listen, that’s, a nice bi-it’s a
biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy! Alvy! You’re the one who never wanted
to make a real commitment. You don’t think I’m smart enough! We had that
argument just last month, or don’t ou remember that day?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, yeah? How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: down a bag of groceries on the Oh, it was …
really weird. But she’s a very nice woman.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And I didn’t have to lie down on the couch,
Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family
and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my
brother.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’m.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And then she mentioned penis envy … Did you
know about that?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Me? I’m-I’m one of the few males who suffers
from that, so, so … you know.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: G-go on, I’m interested.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, she said that I was very guilty about
my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And then I remembered when I was a kid how I
accidentally saw my parents making love.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first
hour?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s amazing. I-I-I … I’ve been goin’ for
fifteen years, I-you know, I don’t got … nothing like that in-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You cried? I’ve never once cried. Fantastic
…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: In-in … Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is
holding his pillow across my face and I can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sinatra?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, and he’s strangling me …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: … and I keep, you know, it’s-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, well, sure … because he’s a singer and
you’re a singer, you know, so it’s perfect. So you’re trying to
suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that’s a perfect
analytic … kind of insight.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She said, your name was Alvy Singer.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whatta you mean? Me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream …
I break Sinatra’s glasses.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had
glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I’m suffocating you?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, and God, Alvy, I did … this really
terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real
high-pitched voice.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch, what’d the doctor say?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, she said that I should probably come
five times a week. And you know something? I don’t think I mind analysis
at all. The only question is, Will it change my wife?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Will it change your wife?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Will it change my life?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, but you said, “Will it change my
wife”!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, I didn’t. I said, “Will it change my
life,” Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You said, “Will it change. . .” Wife. Will it
change …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Life. I said, “life.”</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: She said, “Will it change my wife.” You heard
that because you were there so I’m not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And, Alvy … and then I told her about how I
didn’t think you’d ever really take me seriously, because you don’t
think that I’m smart enough.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Why do you always bring that up? Because I
encourage you to take adult-education courses? I think it’s a wonderful
thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors’.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Adult education is such junk! The professors
are so phony. How can you do it?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: A bit rapidly. I don’t care what you say
about David, he’s a perfectly fine teacher!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: David! David! I can’t believe this!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And what are you doing following me around
for, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m following you and David, if you-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I just think we oughta call this relationship
quits!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s fine. That’s fine. That’s great! Well,
I don’t know what I did wrong. I mean, I can’t believe this. Somewhere
she cooled off to me! walking down the street carrying Is it-is it
something that I did?</p>
<p><strong>woman on the street</strong>: Never something you do. That’s
how people are. Love fades.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Love fades. God, that’s a depressing thought.
Have to ask you a question. Don’t go any further. Now, with your wife in
bed, d-d-does she need some kind o’ artificial stimulation like-like
marijuana?</p>
<p><strong>man on the street</strong>: We use a large vibrating egg.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Large vibrating egg. Well, I ask a psychopath,
I get that kind of an answer. Jesus, I-I, uh, here … a young
trendy-looking couple, You-you look like a really happy couple. Uh, uh …
are you?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah! So … so h-h-how do you account for
it?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Uh, I’m very shallow and empty and I
have no ideas and nothing interesting to say.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And I’m exactly the same way.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I see. Well, that’s very interesting. So
you’ve managed to work out something, huh?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, well, thanks very much for talking to
me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: You know, even as a kid I always
went for the wrong women. I think that’s my problem. When my mother took
me to see Snow White, everyone fell in love with Snow White. I
immediately fell for the Wicked Queen.</p>
<p><strong>wicked queen</strong>: We never have any fun anymore.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure alvy</strong>: How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>wicked queen</strong>: Why not? You’re always leaning on me
to improve myself.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure alvy</strong>: You’re just upset. You must be
getting your period.</p>
<p><strong>wicked queen</strong>: I don’t get a period! I’m a cartoon
character. Can’t I be upset once in a while?</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure rob</strong>: Max, will you forget about
Annie? I know lots of women you can date.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure alvy</strong>: I don’t wanna go out with any
other women.</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure rob</strong>: Max, have I got a girl for you.
You are going to love her. She’s a reporter-</p>
<p><strong>cartoon figure rob’s voice-over</strong>: -for Rolling
Stone.</p>
<p><strong>female reporter</strong>: I think there are more people here
to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert. I covered
the Dylan concert … which gave me chills. Especially when he sang “She
takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she
does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little
girl.” a guard holds up his hands to stop Up to that I guess the most
charismatic event I covered was Mick’s Birthday when</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Man, that’s great. That’s just great.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You catch Dylan?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Me? No, no. I-I couldn’t make it that ni-
My-my raccoon had hepatitis.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You have a raccoon?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch, a few.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The only word for this is trans-plendid.
It’s trans-plendid.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I can think of another word.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: He’s God! I mean, this man is God! He’s
got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world
just to touch the hem of his garment.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Really? It must be a tremendous hem.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I’m a Rosicrucian myself.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I can’t get with any religion that advertises
in Popular Mechanics. Look- man, walks out of the men’s room, huge
bodyguards flanking him while there’s God coming outta the men’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It’s unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at
the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper
thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I hope you don’t mind that I took so long
to finish.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, no, no, don’t be … tsch … don’t be silly.
You know, I’m startin’ it-I’m startin’ to get some feeling back in my
jaw now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque
experience.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, tsch, thank you. H’m.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I mean that as a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I think-I think there’s too much burden placed
on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uh, oh, I don’t know. It might have been
Leopold and Loeb. it up, rising up slightly from the Hello. Oh, hi … Uh,
no, what-what’s the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible … No,
what- Sure I- Whatta yuh -what kind of an emergency? … No, well, stay
there. Stay there, I’ll come over right now. I’ll come over right now.
Just stay there, I’ll come right over.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’s- It’s me, open up.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Are you okay? What’s the matter? Are you all
right? What-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: There’s a spider in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: There’s a big black spider in the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s what you got me here for at three
o’clock in the morning, ’cause there’s a spider in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: My God, I mean, you know how I am about
insects.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -I can’t sleep with a live thing crawling
around in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Kill it! For Go- What’s wrong with you? Don’t
you have a can of Raid in the house?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I told you a thousand times you should always
keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who’s gonna crawl
over.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a
fire extinguisher.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- ’cause
I’m a little tired. him a magazine, Alvy, still talking, glances around
the apartment. He notices a small You know, you, you joke with-about me,
you make fun of me, but I’m prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal
wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock
concert?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, yeah, really? Really? How-how’d you like
it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it … was it heavy? Did it achieve total
heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It was just great!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful
idea. Why don’tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we’ll
call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it’s a-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I called you; you wanna help me … or not?
H’h? Here.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What is this? What are you, since when do you
read the “National Review”? What are you turning in to?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I like to try to get all points of
view.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s wonderful. Then why don’tcha get William
F. Buckley to kill the spider?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, you’re a little hostile, you know that?
Not only that, you look thin and tired.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I was in be- It’s three o’clock</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I
came over TV –_</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I got the good chocolate, Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, where is the spider?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It really is lovely. It’s in the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Is he in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, don’t squish it, and after it’s dead,
flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o’ times.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Darling, darling, I’ve been killing spiders
since I was thirty, okay?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. What?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Very big spider.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Two … Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There’s two
of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Two?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yep. I didn’t think it was that big, but it’s
a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, I-I left it at your house.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -snow shovel or anything or something.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I think I left it there, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Okay, let me have this.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, what are you doing … what are you doing
with-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Honey, there’s a spider in your bathroom the
size of a Buick.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, okay. Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, what is this? You got black soap?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s for my complexion.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?
Geez. the racquet over the shelf, knocking Don’t worry! all over the
bathroom. He finally moves out of the room, hands close to his body. He
walks into the other room, where Annie is sitting in a corner of her bed
leaning against I did it! I killed them both. What-what’s the matter?
Whatta you- -whatta you sad about? You- What’d you want me to do?
Capture ’em and rehabilitate ’em?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, don’t go, okay? Please.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whatta you mean, don’t go? Whatta-whatta
-what’s the matter? Whatta you expecting -termites? What’s the
matter?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, uh, I don’t know. I miss you. Tsch.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, Jesus, really?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Was there somebody in your room when I called
you?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: W-w-whatta you mean?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I mean was there another- I thought I heard a
voice.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, I had the radio on.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m sorry. I had the television set … I had
the television-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, let’s never break up again. I don’t
wanna be apart.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, no, no, I think we’re both much too mature
for something like that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Living together hasn’t been so bad, has
it?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s all right for me, it’s been terrific, you
know? Better than either one of my marriages. See, ’cause. . . ’cause
there’s just something different about you. I don’t know what it is, but
it’s great.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You know I think that if you let me, maybe I
could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it’s hard and …
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, what about … what if we go away this
weekend, and we could-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch, why don’t we get … why don’t we get Rob,
and the three of us’ll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you
the old neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Okay, okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’d be fun for yuh. Don’t you think-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -me, my God, it’s a great day!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the –</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah, watch the road!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You’ll total the whole car.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, you know, I never even visited Brooklyn
before.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I can’t wait to see the old neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, the neighborhood’s gonna be great.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: We can show her the schoolyard.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I
was the best, I was all schoolyard.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yes, I remember. He was all schoolyard. They
threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, look, look, there’s that … that’s -that’s
my old house. That’s where I used to live.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Holy cow!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You’re lucky, Max-where I used to live is now a
pornographic equipment store.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I have some very good memories there.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother
and father fighting all the time.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous
things.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: You fired the cleaning woman?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: She was stealing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: But she’s colored.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: So the colored have enough
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: She was going through my
pocketbook!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: They’re persecuted enough!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: Who’s persecuting? She stole!</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: All right-so we can afford it.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: How can we afford it? On your pay?
What if she steals more?</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s father</strong>: She’s a colored woman, from Harlem!
She has no money! She’s got a right to steal from us! After all, who is
she gonna steal from if not us?</p>
<p><strong>adult alvy</strong>: You’re both crazy!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: They can’t hear you, Max.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s mother</strong>: Leo … I married a fool!</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hey, Max! Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It-it-it’s the welcome-home party in nineteen
forty-five, for my cousin Herbie.</p>
<p><strong>adult alvy</strong>: Look, look, there’s-there’s that one
over there, that’s Joey Nichols, he was my- Nichols, who’s sitting in
one of the easy chairs. They smile at each other; people and noise all
-father’s friend. He was always bothering me when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>joey</strong>: Joey Nichols. See. Nichols. See, Nichols!
links and a tie pin, which are made from nickels, as Alvy stands with
hands on hips, unconcerned. Joey then slaps his band to his forehead and
puts a nickel on Yuh see, nickels! You can always remember my name, just

Moskowitz had the personality. She’s the life of the ghetto, no
doubt.</p>

you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And we could just sit and talk … nothing. Uh,
not a big deal, it’s just relax, just be very mellow.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Remember, we had that thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What thing?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Don’t you remember we-we-we discussed that
thing that we were-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Thing?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: -yes, we had, uh …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing … … yeah …

<p><strong>tony</strong>: Oh, well, I-if it’s inconvenient, eh, we can’t

<p><strong>entourage</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nice to see you … bye. Yeah. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: What’s … you … well, what’s the matter, You
w-wanna go to that party?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know, I thought it might be kind of
fun, you know what I mean, it’d be nice to meet some new people.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m just not … you know, I don’t think I could
take a mellow eve- ’cause I-I don’t respond well to mellow, you know
what I mean, I-I have a tendency to … if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and
then rot. You know, and it’s-it’s not good for my …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: All right, all right, you don’t wanna go to
the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That day in Brooklyn was the last day I
remember really having a great time.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I’ve been moody and dissatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s psychiatrist</strong>: How often do you sleep
together?</p>
<p><strong>annie’s psychiatrist</strong>: Do you have sex often?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Constantly! I’d say three times a week. Like
the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: She would not sleep with me the other night,
you know, it’s-</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: And … I don’t know … I mean, six months ago
I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I mean … I tried everything, you know, I-I-I
put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: But the thing is-I mean, since our
discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you
woulda been happy because … uh, uh, I really asserted myself.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: The incredible thing about it is, I’m paying
for her analysis and she’s making progress and I’m getting screwed.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know, though, I feel so guilty
because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I
don’t go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it’s like I’m
going against my own feelings. I don’t know I-I can’t win.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know … it’s getting expensive …my analyst
… for her analyst. She- she’s making progress and I’m not making any
progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should
just live with a woman.</p>
<p><strong>woman friend</strong>: Wow, I don’t believe it … you mean to
tell me you guys have never snorted coke?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, I always wanted to try, you know, but,
uh, Alvy, uh … he’s very down on it.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, don’t put it on me. You kn- Wh-what is
it, I don’t wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose ’cause the-the
nasal membranes …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: How can you say that? I mean, who said I-I-I-I
said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep
together in a threesome.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s sick!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I know it’s sick, but it’s new. You
know, you didn’t say it couldn’t be sick.</p>
<p><strong>woman friend</strong>: Just come on, Alvy. sofa. The male
friend starts to prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy and Annie look at each
other, Do your body a favor. Try it, come on.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Come on. It’d be fun.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, I’m sure it’s a lot of fun, ’cause the
Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I
mean, you wanna write, why not?</p>
<p><strong>male friend</strong>: It’s great stuff, Alvy. Friend of mine
just brought it in from California.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, do you know something-I didn’t tell yuh,
we’re going to California next week.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah …</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: … I’m thrilled. As you know, uh … uh, on my
agent’s advice I sold out, and I’m gonna do an appearance on TV.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No, no, no that’s not it at all. Alvy’s
giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he’s violating a moral
issue sitting here.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re kidding?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s so phony, and we have to leave New York
during Christmas week, which really kills me.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Alvy, listen, while you’re in California, could
you possibly score some coke for me?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sure, sure, I’ll be glad to. I-I’ll just put
it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I have in my boot, you know. gold case
of cocaine base the man placed on the coffee table and H-h-how much is
this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s about two thousand dollars an ounce.</p>

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I
never …</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: We wish you a Merry Christmas, We wish you a
Merry Christmas, We wish you a Merry Christmas, And a -Happy New
Year.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I’ve never been so relaxed as I have been since
I moved out here, Max. I want you to see my house. I live right next to
Hugh Hefner’s house, Max. He lets me use the Jacuzzi. And the women,
Max, they’re like the women in Playboy magazine, only they can move
their arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You know, I can’t get over that this is
really Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: We wish you a Merry Christmas, And a Happy
New Year.</p>

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: It’s that they don’t throw their garbage away.
They make it into television shows.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will yuh?
It’s Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Can you believe this is Christmas here?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You know, it was snowing-it was snowing and
really gray in New York yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Right-well, Santa Claus will have
sunstroke.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Max, there’s no crime, there’s no mugging.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: There’s no economic crime, you know, but
there’s-there’s ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there’s
wheat- germ killers out here.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: While you’re out here, Max, I want you to see
some of my TV show. And we’re invited to a big Christmas party.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Remember Christ our Savior Was born on
Christmas day To save us all … from Satan’s power As we were gone

<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh
here.</p>
<p><strong>rob on tv screen</strong>: A limousine to the track
breakdown?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: A little bigger.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Do you realize how immoral this all is?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Max, I’ve got a hit series.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I know; but you’re adding fake
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rob on tv screen</strong>: Arnie.</p>
<p><strong>arnie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Look, uh …</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: We do the show live in front of an
audience.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Great, but nobody laughs at it ’cause your
jokes aren’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s why this machine is
dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>rob on tv screen</strong>: You better lie down. You’ve been
in the sun too long.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah … uh, now give me a like a medium-size
chuckle here … and then a big hand.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Is there booing on there?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We were just gonna fix you up with my cousin
Dolores.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, Max, I don’t feel well.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know, I just got-I got very dizzy… I
feel dizzy, Max.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Well, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I don’t know, I mean, I-</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You wanna lie down?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy
all morning. I just started getting …</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: How about a ginger ale?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, Max … no, I maybe I better lie down.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Why don’t you just try to get a little of
this down? This is just plain chicken.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, oh, no, I can’t-I can’t eat this. I’m
nauseous. If you could-if you could just give me something to get me
through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank … and
give out an award on a TV show.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well … H-h huh … Oh, good … Yes, I’ll tell
him.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, there’s nothing wrong with you
actually, so far as I can tell. I mean, you have no fever, no … no
symptoms of anything serious. You haven’t been eating pork or
shellfish.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Excuse me. I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Doctor. Uh,
Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a
replacement, so they’re going to tape without you.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m nauseous. Oh, jesus, now I don’t get to do
the TV show?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah. Listen, Doctor, I’m worried.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now, Mrs. Singer, I can’t find anything
–</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nothing at all?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: No, I think I can get a lab man up here.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What do you mean? Do you think he’s-</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, excuse me. Perhaps it would be even
better if we took him to the hospital for a day or two.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Uh-huh … Oh, hospital?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, otherwise, there’s no real way to tell
what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: This is not bad, actually.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, don’t tell me we’re gonna hafta walk from
the car to the house. Geez, my feet haven’t touched pavement since I
reached Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Well, you take a meeting with him, I’ll
take a meeting with you if you’ll take a meeting with Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a
meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: All the good meetings are taken.</p>
<p><strong>3rd man</strong>: Right now it’s only a notion, but I think I
can get money to make it into a concept … and later turn it into an
idea.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: You like this house, Max?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: I even brought a road map to get us to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey’s
party.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: What difference does that make?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I think he has a little thing for Annie.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh, no, no, that’s bullshit, Max. He goes with
that girl over there.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: The one with the V.P.L.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, she’s a ten, Max, and that’s great for
you because you’re -you’re used to twos, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: There are no twos, Max.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, you’re used to the kind with the- with
the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks
on muttering.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: M’hm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: And … uh-</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: How do you like this couple, Max?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: And I think they just came back from Masters
and Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, intensive care ward. My God-hey, Max, I
think she’s … I think she’s giving me the eye.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going
to turn into guacamole.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’ll handle it. I’ll handle it. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>girl in white</strong>: You’re Alvy Singer, right? Didn’t we
meet at EST?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: EST? No, no, I was never to est.</p>
<p><strong>girl in white</strong>: Then how can you criticize it?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh, he-he didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No, no, I came out here to get some shock
therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I … He’s my-my food taster.
Have you two met?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Hi. How do you do.</p>
<p><strong>girl in white</strong>: Do you taste to see if the food’s
poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, he’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, you guys are wearin’ white. It must be in
the stars.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Uri Geller must be on the premises
someplace.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: We’re gonna operate together.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: We just need about six weeks, in about six
weeks we could cut a whole album.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know, this is strange to me, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: just … that’s all you need. You can come and
stay here.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: There’s a whole wing in this house.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You can have it to use. Why-why are you
smiling?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>1st man</strong>: Not only is he a great agent, but he really
gives good meetings.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man</strong>: M’mm.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: This is a great house, really. Everything.
Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners
were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Trigger.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Right before his un-American thing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, this place is great.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Uh, you guys are still-uh, you’re still New
Yorkers.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, I love it there.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Well, I used to live there. I used to live
there for years. You know, but it’s gotten-it’s so dirty now.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m into garbage. It’s my thing.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Boy, this is really a nice screening room.
It’s really a nice room.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Oh, and there’s another thing about New York.
See … you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It could be freezing, it could be raining.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: And here, you just-</p>
<p><strong>girl in white</strong>: We saw “Grand Illusion” here last
night.</p>
<p><strong>alvy and annie</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>man on the sofa</strong>: That’s a great film if you’re high.
at the man on the sofa. He looks up at them, smiling, a joint in Hey,
you.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Come and see our bedroom. We did a fantastic
lighting job. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, good. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: It’s wonderful. I mean, you know they just
watch movies all day.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You
know it’s important to make a little effort once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t you think his girl friend’s
beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, she’s got a great-lookin’ fa- A pat on
the androgynous side. But it’s…</p>
<p><strong>man on the phone</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I forgot my
mantra.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice-over</strong>: That was fun. I don’t think
California is bad at all. It’s a drag coming home.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: Lotta beautiful women. It was fun
to flirt.</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice-over</strong>: I have to face facts. I-I adore
Alvy, but our relationship doesn’t seem to work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: I’ll have the usual trouble with
Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?</p>
<p><strong>annie’s voice-over</strong>: If only I had the nerve to break
up, but it would really hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: If only I didn’t feel guilty
asking Annie to move out. It’d probably wreck her. But I should be
honest.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, uh, let’s face it. You know something,
don’t think our relationship is working.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is
like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.
And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whose “Catcher in the Rye” is this?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, let’s see now … If it has my name on
it, then I guess it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, it sure has … You know, you wrote your
name in all my books, ’cause you knew this day was gonna come.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just
as much as I do.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: There’s no-no question in my mind. I think
we’re doing the mature thing, without any doubt.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Now, look, all the books on death and dying
are yours and all the poetry books are mine.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: This “Denial of Death”. You remember this?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: This is the first book that I got you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: -God.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Remember that day?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Right. Geez, I feel like there’s a great
weight off my back. M’mmm.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Thanks, honey.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no,
no, no, I mean, I think it’s really important for us to explore new
relationships and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: There’s no-there’s no question about that,
’cause we’ve given this … uh, uh, I think a more than fair shot, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for
me.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her,
because my-my analyst recommended her.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, why should I put you through all my
moods and hang-ups anyway?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Right. And you-and you know what the beauty
part is?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: We can always come back together again.
Because there’s no-there’s no problem. ’Cause … Right.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Exactly, but … exactly. Ooooh!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You know, I-I-I don’t think many couples could
handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Hey, this one’s mine, this button. This one,
you rem-</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh,
Eisenhower … Impeach Nixon … Impeach Lyndon Johnson … Impeach Ronald
Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I miss Annie. I made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p><strong>man on the street</strong>: She’s living in Los Angeles with
Tony Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, if she is, then the hell with
her! If she likes that lifestyle, let her live there! He’s a jerk, for
one thing.</p>
<p><strong>man on the street</strong>: He graduated Harvard.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes mistakes
too, you know. Kissinger taught there.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re jealous?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. Lemme,
lemme-can I show you something, lady? What I have here … I found this in
the apartment. Black soap. She used to wash her face eight hundred times
a day with black soap. Don’t ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Well, why don’t you go out with other
women?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Well, I-I tried, but it’s, uh, you know, it’s
very depressing.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: This always happens to me. Quick, g-go get a
broom.</p>
<p><strong>girl date</strong>: What are you making such a big deal
about? from the tray to the floor. Alvy jumps away, then gingerly
scrapes They’re only lobsters. Look, you’re a grown man, you know how to
pick up a lobster.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m not myself since I stopped smoking.</p>
<p><strong>girl date</strong>: Oh, when’d you quit smoking?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sixteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>girl date</strong>: Whatta you mean?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Mean?</p>
<p><strong>girl date</strong>: You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is
that what you said? Oh, I-I don’t understand. Are you joking, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Listen, honey, Central Park’s turning green …
Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic that we-where we used to see … with the,
uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, and the roller skates? . . . Listen,
I-I want you to come back here … Well, I-I-then I’m gonna come out there
and getcha.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do- where
do you think I am? I’m-I’m out … I’m at the Los Angeles Airport. I flew
in … Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you … Hey, listen, can we not debate
this on-on the telephone because I’m, you know, I-I feel that I got a
temperature and I’m-I’m getting my-my chronic Los Angeles nausea. I-I
don’t feel so good.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: Well, where-wherever you wanna
meet, I don’t care. I’ll-I’ll drive in. I rented a car I’m driving …
that … Whatta you mean? What-why is that such a miracle? I’m driving
myself –</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I’m gonna…I’m gonna have the alfalfa sprouts
and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.</p>

<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that’s
all. exactly knowing where to start; Well, you look nice.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You see, I-I’ve been thinking about it and I
think that we should get married.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh, Alvy, come on.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Why? You wanna live out here all year? It’s
like living in Munchkin Land.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it’s perfectly
fine out here. I mean, Tony’s very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and
I go to parties and-and we play tennis. I mean, that’s … that’s a very
big step for me, you know? I mean … I’m able to enjoy people more.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So whatta you … You’re not gonna come back to
New York?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: What’s so great about New York? I mean, it’s
a dying city. You read “Death in Venice.”</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Hey, you didn’t read “Death in Venice” till I
bought it for yuh.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: That’s right, that’s right. You only gave me
books with the word “death” in the titles.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: That’s right, ’cause it’s an important
issue.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, you’re incapable of enjoying life, you
know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You’re just this person.
You’re like this island unto yourself.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I can’t enjoy anything unless I … unless
everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that’s … you
know, I-I … it puts a crimp in my evening. So wanna get married or
what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No. We’re friends. I wanna remain
friends.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I … Can I …
Can I …</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: You’re mad, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: No. Yes, of course I’m mad, because you love
me, I know that.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Alvy, I can’t say that that’s true at this
point in my life. I really just can’t say that that’s true. I mean, you
know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know … you’re the reason that I
got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and-and, you know,
get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I
don’t wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh h’h, so whatta you up to anyway,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: The usual, you know. Uh, tryin’t’write. I’m
workin’ on a play. Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you’re not comin’
back to New York with me?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: No! Look, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You mean that … I-I-I-I flew three thousand
miles to see you.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what
that does to my stomach?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: If you must know, it’s a hectic time for
Tony. The Grammys are tonight.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: The Grammys. He’s got a lotta records up for
awards.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You mean they give awards for that kind o’
music?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: I thought just earplugs.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Just forget it, Alvy, okay? Let’s just forget
the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Awards! They do nothing but give out awards! I
can’t believe it. Greatest, greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Officer, I know what you’re gonna say. I’m-I’m
not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with-with-with-</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: May I see your license, please?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Sure. just don’t-don’t get angry, you know
what I mean? ’Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it’s
a rented car. And I’ve …</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Don’t give me your life story -just pick up
the license.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely
’cause I’ve had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Just give me the license, please.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Since you put it that way. It’s hard for me to
refuse. license, then proceeds to rip it up. He lets the pieces go; …
have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I’m… it’s
not your fault. Don’t take it personal.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: So long, fellas. Keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Imagine my surprise when I got your call,
Max.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a
bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine
the mathematical possibilities?</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: You’re an actor, Max. You should be doing
Shakespeare in the Park.</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got
mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather
jackets stole my leotard.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Max, are we driving through plutonium?</p>
<p><strong>rob</strong>: Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don’t get
old.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: You’re a thinking person. How can you choose
this lifestyle?</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: What is so incredibly great about New York?
It’s a dying city! You-you read “Death in Venice”.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: You didn’t read “Death in Venice” till I gave
it to you!</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: Well, you only give me books with the word
“death” in the title.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: It’s an important issue.</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying
life.</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: You’re like New York. You’re an island.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Okay, if that’s all that we’ve been through
together means to you, I guess it’s better if we just said goodbye, once
and for all! You know, it’s funny, after all the serious talks and
passionate moments that it ends here … in a health -food restaurant on
Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.</p>
<p><strong>actress</strong>: Wait! I’m-I’m gonna … go with you. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>alvy</strong>: Tsch, whatta you want? It was my first play.
You know, you know how you’re always tryin’ t’ get things to come out
perfect in art because, uh, it’s real difficult in life. Interestingly,
however, I did run into Annie again. It was on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice</strong>: She had moved back to New York. She
was living in SoHo with some guy. And when I met her she was, of all
things, dragging him in to see “The Sorrow and the Pity.” Which I
counted as a personal triumph. Annie and I … scene shot through a window
of Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and Annie sitting at a table, laughing …
we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old
times.</p>
<p><strong>alvy’s voice-over</strong>: After that it got pretty late.
And we both hadda go, but it was great seeing Annie again, right? I
realized what a terrific person she was and-and how much fun it was just
knowing her and I-I thought of that old joke, you know, this- this-this
guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, “Doc, uh, my brother’s crazy. He
thinks he’s a chicken.” And, uh, the doctor says, “Well, why don’t you
turn him in?” And the guy says, “I would, but I need the eggs.” Well, I
guess that’s pretty much how how I feet about relationships. You know,
they’re totally irrational and crazy and absurd and … but, uh, I guess
we keep goin’ through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.</p>
