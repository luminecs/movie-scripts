<p><strong>over black</strong>: We hear labored breathing.</p>
<p><strong>we stay on black</strong>: …breathing continues…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Do you find me sadistic?</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice</strong>: I bet I could fry an egg on your head
about now, if I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice</strong>: No kiddo, I’d like to believe, even
now, you’re aware enough to know there isn’t a trace of sadism in my
actions… Okay - Maybe towards these other jokers - bot not your.</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT
looking down at the woman on the floor. Bill bent down over her. Four
others in black suits, standing over her . And about four DEAD BODIES
lying in their own blood. We also see we’re in a wedding chapel that’s
been redecorated by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly,
depending on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown. This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth
she will only be referred to as The BRIDE.</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice</strong>: No Kiddo at this moment, this is me at
my most masochistic.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bill, I’m pregnant. It’s your baby.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s Tim, Arthur’s best friend.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s his girlfriend Janeen.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s my best friend from work
Erica.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s the minister. I think his name was
Reverend Hillhouse.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s his wife.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Organ player, don’t know her name.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: And that, that’s me. I’m the Bride.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Looked dead, didn’t I? Well I wasn’t, but
it wasn’T for lack fo trying, I can tell you that. Actually Bill’s last
bullet put me in a coma. A coma I was to lie in for five years. When I
woke up, …I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring
Rampage of Revenge. I roarded and I rampaged and I got bloody
satisfaction. In all, I’ve killed 33 people to get to this piont right
now. I have only one more. The last one.</p>
<p><strong>we cut out one…two…three…to a</strong>: CU of The BRIDE IN
GLORIOUS COLOR She’s sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused
on something.</p>
<p><strong>ex cu</strong>: A long, white female finger pushes a
doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - spaghetti western style</strong>: We’re back
inside the wedding chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life
by four people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the face… WE
see it’s the black housewife, five years earlier.</p>
<p><strong>four-year-old girl</strong>: Mommy, I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Hey baby, how was school?</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Mommy, what happened to you and the
T.V. Room?</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Oh, that good for nothin dog of
yours, got his little ass in the living room and acted a damn fool,
that’s what happened.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Barney did this?</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Now baby, you can’t come in here,
there’s broken glass all over the floor, and you gonna cut yourself.</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: This is a old friend of mommy’s I
ain’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hello sweety, I’m , what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Her name is Nikki.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Nikki. What a pretty name for such a
pretty little girl. How old are you Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Nikki, aked you a question.</p>
<p><strong>nikki</strong>: I’m four.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Four years old, aye. You know I once had
a little girl. She’d be five right now. Maybe you two could of played
with each other.</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Now baby, me an have some grown-up
talk to talk about, so you go in your room now and leave us alone till I
tell you to come out.</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Nikkia - in your room - now.</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>the housewife</strong>: Cream and sugar?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Both, please.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: This Pasadena homemaker’s name is Jeanne
Bell. Her husband is Dr. Lawrence Bell. But back when we were
acquainted, five years ago, her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her code name,
was “COBRA”….. Mine was BLACK MAMBA.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Were you expecting me?</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Yes and no. Bill got in touch with me right
after you woke up, and then again a little later after your episode in
Japan. So I suppose it’s a little late for a apology, huh?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You suppose correctly.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Even if I was sincere?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh. I’m quite positive you’re sorry,
now.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Look bitch, I need to know if you’re gonna
start anymore shit around my baby girl!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You can relax for now. I’m not going to
murder you in front of your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: That’s being more rational than Bill led me
to believe you were capable of.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Well that’s a demonstration of Bill’s
complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what I’m
thinking, and what I might do. It’s mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I
lack, not rationality.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ll wait for now, but I won’t wait for
long. I’ll allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again,
preferably as far away from Nikki as possible. I could have just HIT
you, I didn’t, I demand respect for that. Since this is not a HIT,
consider it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly Vipers, we will observe
Viper rules of honor. One on one - no help - no bushwhackin - no
treacherous weapons - on weapon of choice - our skill and our
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: - I’m not through telling you. Failure to
keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a
xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a
building across the street from Nikki’s elementary school. Now, feel
free to respond.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Look…I know I fucked you over. I fucked you
over bad. I wish to God I hadn’t, but I did.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: If I could go back in a machine I would,
but I can’t. All I can tell you is I’m a different person now.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Be that as it may, I know I do not deserve
mercy or forgiveness. However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: – Bitch, you can stop right there.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Just because I have no wish to murder you
before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in
front of me is going to inspire sympathy. You and I have unfinished
business.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: You have every right to wanna get even
–</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: – But that’s where you’re wrong, Vernita.
I don’t want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill
you, go into Nikki’s room, kill her, then wait for your old man,
Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my
unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her
mother’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: When do we do this?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It all depends… When do you want to die?
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? That’s about as long as I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: How bout tonight, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Spendid. Where?</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: There’s a baseball diamond where our little
league has its games, about a mile from here. We meet there around
two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black
stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won’t be</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bill said you were one of the best ladies
he’d ever seen with an edged weapon.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn’t qualify
it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba. Black Mamba,
I shoulda been motherfuckin Black Mamba.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Weapon of choice? And if you want to
stick with your butcher knife, I’m cool with that.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>vernita</strong>: Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
don’t…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Do to your daughter, what you did to
mine… …I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It was not my intention to do this in
front of you. For that I’m sorry. But you can take my word for it, your
mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it,
I’ll be waiting.</p>
<p><strong>a subtitle appears:</strong>: under her face.</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: A red umbrella opens as rain falls
down.</p>
<p><strong>barefoot ankle and leg</strong>: stepping into a sheer, white
stocking.</p>
<p><strong>needle stuck in a vial</strong>: The liquid is drawn up into
the syringe.</p>
<p><strong>nurse’s cap is placed</strong>: ON TOP of the woman’s blonde
head.</p>
<p><strong>ex cu elle driver’s eye and white eye patch</strong>: looking
down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and opposite number.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I might never of liked you. Point in fact I
despise you. But that doesn’t suggest I don’t respect you. You were a
master of a profession that’s most difficult to master. Dying in our
sleep is a luxury our kind is rarely afforded. My gift to you.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Hello, Bill. Affirmative. Comatose. I’m
standing over her right now. What!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Don’t fuckin ssshhh me! If you think I came
all the way down to Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm no less - just to
tuck sleeping beauty in bed - you got another fuckin thing comin - You
don’t owe her Shit!! You don’t owe her shit. Man, fuck that bitch! Oh
you’re not are you? Well Bill, you never leave a job half done. A great
teacher taught me that once, he looked a whole lot like</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I guess. No, I don’t need to guess, I know.
Affirmative. I love you too, bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Thought that was pretty funny didn’t ya? Word
of advice shithead, don’t you ever wake up.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Ya know now I get a better look at you, you’re
not so damn pretty. Yeah, you go that Venus thing going for you but…ya
know, now I get a closer look at you you’re kinda weird looking. You got
this big nose that doesn’t fit with the rest of your face, your eyes are
two different sizes. And look at your skin…My complexion is way better
than yours –</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, no you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: If you ever take your ass out of this Goddamn
bed for as long as you fuckin live, I will beat you into the ground,
bitch!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Nurse come here quick, we’re losing this
man!</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Tough titty, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>macro cu</strong>: of mosquito on The Bride’s forearm, its
stinger dug in her flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.</p>
<p><strong>cu mosquito’s face</strong>: drinking her blood.</p>
<p><strong>macroshot of mosquito on forearm</strong>: drinking
blood…when The Bride’s hand comes into FRAME and SQUASHES the bug flat.
Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.</p>
<p><strong>quick cut to a flashback spaghetti-western style</strong>:
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: My baby.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Five years.</p>
<p><strong>we see the cinematic equivalent of a comic book
thought</strong>: BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL’S BLACK
BOOTS walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.</p>
<p><strong>left side right side</strong>: The BRIDE listening to them
Orderly’s Reeboks walking getting closer. WE HEAR the down the hospital
STEP…STEP…STEP…in time corridor. with Orderly’s sneakers.</p>
<p><strong>camera moves up to</strong>: Orderly’s face, leading two
TRUCKDRIVERS.</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice orderly</strong>: She’s right in here. She’s
right in here.</p>
<p><strong>split screen finishes</strong>: STAY WITH The BRIDE’S
SCREEN</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Now is that the cutest little blonde
pussy you ever saw, or is that the cutest little blonde pussy,
YOU-EVEA-SAW?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I seen better.</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I know
damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to.
The price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you gittin your

<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Here’s the rules; Rule number one; no
punchin ’er. Nurse comes in tomorrow an she got ’er a shiner - or less
some teeth, jig’s up. So no knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.
And by the</p>
<p><strong>two truckers</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Rule number two; No monkey bites, no
hickeys - in fact no leavin no marks of no kind. But after that, it’s
allll goooood. Her plummin down there don’t work no more, so feel free
to cum in ’er all ya wont. Keep the noise down - try not to make a mess,
and I’ll be back in twenty.</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Oh by the way, not all the time, but
sometimes this cunt’s cunt can get drier than a bucket of sand. If she
dry, lube up with this and you’ll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Hey Warren, she just blinked.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: He said she can’t blink.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: I know what he said, I’m tellin ya</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Just wait, when I get through with this
little dumbbell, she gonna stand up and recite the Gettysburg
Ad-dress.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Hey, Gerald.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: This shit ain’t no peep show. Go out in the
hall and I’ll let ya know when it’s your turn.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Awww c’mon, I gotta leave the room?</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: I can’t get no errection wit you lookin at

<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Well, just hurry up then.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: He man, keep it down in there, I can hear

<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>impact cut</strong>: The Orderly HITTING the floor face
first. The boy is stunned.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Where’s Bill?</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bill! Where is Bill!</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: I dunno no Bill.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I saw him here myself…..</p>
<p><strong>slam!</strong>: ….Now do you tell me where he is, or do I
beat your fuckin brains in?</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: Please please stop, don’t hit me
again!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Where is Bill?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Where did you get this from?</p>
<p><strong>the orderly</strong>: That’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in this
room ten minutes ago.</p>
<p><strong>we do a quick shaw brothers zoom into her eyes -</strong>: We
see Buck enter her room that first night, five years ago…. He’s holding
in his hand one of those big flashlights you use in a tent when camping.
– It gives off a soft blue light. Buck examines The Bride through the
blue.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Well, ain’t you the slice of cutie pie they
all said you wuz. Well Ma’am, I’m from Longview Texas, my name’s Buck,
and I’m here to fuck.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Your name’s Buck, right? And you came to
fuck, right?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wiggle your big toe.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wiggle your big toe.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wiggle your big toe.</p>
<p>****: As I lay in the back of Buck’s pickup truck, trying to will my
limbs out of entropy, I could see the faces of the cunts who did this to
me, and the dick responsible. Members all of Bill’s brainchild; “The
Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.”</p>
<p><strong>assassinatino squad</strong>: the D.iV.A.S.”</p>
<p><strong>classified</strong>: as</p>
<p><strong>o-ren ishii</strong>: as</p>
<p><strong>vernita green</strong>: as</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: as</p>
<p><strong>elle driver</strong>: as</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Now after five years of beauty sleep I
knew absolutely nothing about my enemies’ strengths weakness or
whereabouts. But as fated by God vengeance would have it, I who knew
nothing - knew one thing. As sure as God made little green apples…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: ….if O-Ren Ishii, the first name on my
Death List, was still alive… she’d live in Japan. O-Ren Ishii, made her
first acquaintance with death at the age of eleven.</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: CU O-REN , hiding under a bed,
watching…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
half-Japanese American Army brat witnessed the murder of her Master
Sergeant father. And the rape, then murder of her mother at the hands of
Japan’s most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
revenge…luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren on top of boss matsumoto plunging a huge knife into
his</strong>: CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl uniform.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: At thirteen, she got her revenge.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: By twenty, she was one of the tip top of
female assassins in the world.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: At twenty-three she joined Bill’s Deadly
Vipers…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: At twenty five she did her part in the
killing of eight innocent people, including my unborn daughter, in a
small wedding chapel in El Paso Texas. But on that day, five years ago,
she made one big mistake…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: …she Should of killed nine. However,
before statisfaction would be mine, first things first…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wiggel your big toe.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hart part’s over. Now let’s get these
other piggies wiggling.</p>
<p><strong>pov through windshield:</strong>: The truck shines its
headlight beams on an open patch of prairie wasteland. We see dirt,
rocks, plants, and an oil derrick pumping up and down.</p>
<p><strong>1 snub nose .38</strong>: w/ ANKLE HOLSTER.</p>
<p><strong>1 black vertical attache case.</strong>: She flips it open,
and inside broken down into four separate pieces is a HIGH-POWERED,
SCOPE-SIGHT RIFLE.</p>
<p><strong>1 manila envelope.</strong>: She reaches in and pulls out a
PHOTOCOPY OF HER SONOGRAM. There on the page is a photocopy of her
unborn baby girl. A fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the
sonogram back in the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: 1 BANK BOOK and 1 DRIVER’S LICENSE w/ The
Bride’s photo on it and the name “CANDY RALSTON” on each.</p>
<p><strong>truth serum</strong>: of Bill’s own concoction. He calls it,
“The Undisputed Truth.”</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: of the Bride in her passenger seat,
flying to Japan. We see she’s holding a clean white handkerchief. She’s
sewing the name “Bill” in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: English?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Almost – American.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Domo.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Oh, “Domo”, Very good – very good, you
speak Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Nooo, just a few words I learned since
yesterday. - May I sit at the bar?</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Sure sure sure - sit. What other words
did you learn - excuse me –</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: – What other Japanese you learn?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh…let’s see…“Arigato.”</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: “Arigato”…Very good.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: …“Ah-So”…</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: “Ah-So!” You know what “Ah-So”
means�</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: “I See.”</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: I see - Very good.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I already said “Domo”, right?</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: “Kon-netie-wa.”</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: …“Kon-nichi-wa”…repeat please.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: “Kon-nichi-wa?”</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Most impressive…you say Japanese words,
like you Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Now you’re making fun of me.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: No no no - serious business.
Pronunciation - very good. You say “Arigato” …like we say “Arigato.”</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Well, thank you - I mean…arigato.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: You should learn Japanese - very
easy.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No kidding, I heard it’s kinda hard.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I always heard it was difficult.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Yes yes yes - most difficult. But you
have Japanese tongue.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Maybe I was Japanese in another life.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Most definitely, most definitely
Japanese in another life.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: How did you know tuna’s my favorite?</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Tuna’s my favorite.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Ah, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: - Drink -</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Ahhh sake, Very good.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: First time in Japan?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: A-huh.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes, this is my first time.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: What brings you to Okinawa?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I came to see a man.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Aaahh, you have friend live in
Okinawa?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Not friend?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ve never met him.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hattori Hanzo.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I need Japanese steel.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: Why do you need Japanese steel?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I have vermin to kill.</p>
<p><strong>sushi chef</strong>: You must have big rats you need Hattori
Hanzo steel.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Huge.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: Yes you may…..</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …try the second one down in the sixth row on
your left.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: Funny, you like samurai swords…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …I like baseball.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: I wanted to show you these…. However someone
as you, who knows so much must surely know, I no longer make instruments
of death. I keep these here for their ascetic and sentimental value. Yet
proud tho I am of my life’s work… I am retired.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Then give me one of these.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: These are not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I didn’t say, sell me. I said, give
me.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: And why should I be obliged to assist you in
the extermination of your vermin?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Because my vermin, is a former student of
yours. And considering the student, I’d say you had a rather large
obligation.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …You can sleep there…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …it will take me a week to make the
sword…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …I suggest you spend it practicing.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: I’m done doing what I swore an oath to God 28
years ago to never do again. I’ve created, “something that kills
people.” And in that purpose I was a success.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: I’ve done this, because philosophically I’m
sympathetic to your aim.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest
sword. If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be
cut.</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: Revenge is never a straight line. It’s a
forest. And like a forest it’s easy to lose your way…to get lost… to
forget where you came in. To serve as a compass, a combat philosophy
must be adopted that can be found in the secret doctrine of the Yagu
Ninja. And now my yellow haired warrior, repeat after me;</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: “When engaged in combat, the vanquishing of
thine enemy can be the warrior’s only concern…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …This is the first and cardinal rule of
combat…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: …Suppress all human emotion and
compassion…</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: This truth lies at the heart of the art of
combat. Once it is mastered… Thou shall fear no one… Though the devil
himself may bar thy way…</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Domo.</p>
<p><strong>showdown</strong>: at</p>
<p><strong>a blank piece of drawing paper</strong>: A hand comes in and,
as the Bride talks over this image, draws with a piece of charcoal, a
portrait of the geisha regaled O-REN ISHII.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: When fortune smiles on something as
violent and ugly as revenge, at the time it seems proof like no other,
that not only does God exist, you’re doing his will. At a time when I
knew the last about my enemies, the first name on my death list, was the
easiest to find. But</p>
<p><strong>japanese animation sequence</strong>: We see Japamation-style
images of The Bride’s verbiage.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: At the age of twenty, Bill backed his
Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her
Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans,
over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: When it was all over, it was the
geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that proved the victor.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: And just in case you’re wondering how
could a half breed Japanese Chinese American become the boss of all
criminal activity in Tokyo, Japan,… I’ll tell you. The subject of
O-Ren’s blood and nationality came up before the council only once. The
night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: The man who seems bound and determined to
break the mood is Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka thinks is…</p>
<p><strong>crime family leader #2</strong>: Tanaka? What’s the meaning
of this outburst? This is a time for celebration.</p>
<p><strong>boss tanaka</strong>: And what exactly should I be
celebrating? The perversion of our illustrious council?</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Gentlemen…Boss Tanaka obviously has something
on his mind. Allow him to express it.</p>
<p><strong>boss tanaka</strong>: My father… …along with yours and…
…along With yours, started this council. And while you drink like fish
and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion
committed today.</p>
<p><strong>boss tanaka</strong>: I speak, Mistress Ishii,….of the
perversion done to this council, which I love more than my own
children,…by making a half Chinese American its leader.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Fight me or work for me.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Drop them on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Get behind me.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Get on your knees.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Put your foreheads on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Keep your mouths shut.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: I’m going to say this in English so you know
how serious I am. As your leader, I encourage you to – from time to time
and always in a respectful manner, and with the complete knowledge that
my decision is final – to question my logic. If you’re unconvinced a
particular plan of action I’ve decided is the wisest, tell me so. But
allow me to convince you. And I will promise you, right here and now, no
subject will be taboo…except the subject that was just under
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Hand me that head.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: I didn’t think so. Meeting adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: EX CU OF AN EYEBALL</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride’s fingers come
into FRAME and move blonde hair out of the sensory appendage’s way.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: The mop tops in black suits and Kato
masks were O-Ren’s soldiers, “The Crazy 88.” The two young girls in the
schoolgirl uniforms are her personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters.
Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady who’s
dressed like she’s a villain on Star Trek is O-Ren’s best friend and her
lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And finally, the American in the black suit but
sans Kato mask, O-Ren’s head of security, Mr. Barrel.</p>
<p><strong>back and forth</strong>: between CU’s of the two women, face
to face.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes, I am looking for the attorney of
O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would that be you?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: I’m Mistress Ishii’s attorney. How can I help
you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: O-Ren Ishii! You and I have unfinished
business!</p>
<p><strong>o-ren’s</strong>: reaction shows how effective the element of
surprise turned out to be. She says The Bride’s name softly to herself;
it’s</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump,
twists her body in agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant
Splashes of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both surprise
and shock.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel and go go</strong>: take positions on either side
of O-Ren.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: seated in a shogun’s seat, rises furiously to
her feet.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Sorry everybody, but I’m afraid we’re going
to have to close the place. There’s some private business that we must
attend to now.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Miki.</p>
<p><strong>miki</strong>: You had it coming bastard!</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: Looking down on The Bride at one end
and O-Ren and her crew at the other. A Red Circle appears where the
blade is buried in the floor…The red circle grows larger…and larger…and
larger…and larger still…</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Tear the bitch apart!</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her
eyes narrow.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: smiles.</p>
<p><strong>o -ren</strong>: You didn’t think it was going to be that
easy, did you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You know, for a second there, yeah I
did.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Silly rabbit…</p>
<p><strong>o-ren/the bride</strong>: …Trix Are for kids.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: WHIPS OPEN a red fan.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot - framed like a kabuki stage</strong>: With the
lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers fight in front of
turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow falling outside is reflected
against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet
stage.</p>
<p><strong>go go</strong>: Standing by the junction box, flips a switch
turning the lights back on. The electricity shines light on…</p>
<p><strong>ball and chain</strong>: in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball
comes right at us.</p>
<p><strong>go go</strong>: smiles…then…WHOOSH…WHOOSH…</p>
<p><strong>cu go go</strong>: We see her face as she’s delivered a death
blow right behind it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and
spirit shatter like a teapot.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Any more subordinates for me to kill,
O-Ren?</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: One last one.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You’re Mr. Barrel, right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: And you’re Black Mamba.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Our reputations precede us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don’t you wear
your Kato mask? Are you and iconoclast?</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: I don’t like that rubber band. It fucks
up my hair.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You shouldn’t work for her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: Too late.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It’s not too late to quit.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: Do you have choices?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: I know exactly how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: This has nothing to do with You and I,
and everything to do with me taking satisfaction from that bitch behind
you. And there’s absolutely positively no way I’M going to leave here
without taking that satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you have to stand
aside. And that means you must quit, right now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes you can.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: No I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Don’t say “Can’t”, there are no “Cant’s.”
Yes - You - Can…..</p>
<p><strong>o-ren ishii</strong>: Screams at her “…last line of
defense;”</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: What are you waiting for? Are you on a date?
Attack her you fool!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh my God… …She just called you a fool.
She just called you a fool in front of me. Not only am I your opponent.
I’m a female fellow countryman. And you’re going to risk your life - to
say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool?</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Attack, Goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ll owe ya one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: The things I do for a pretty face.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath,
The Handle locks into place with a Click.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: About that one you owe me.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: I’m gonna collect someday, you know?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ll be disappointed if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mr. barrel</strong>: Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Very funny. Your instrument is quite
impressive.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Domo.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Where was it made?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Okinawa.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: This is Hattori Hanzo steel.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Swords however never get tired. I hope you’ve
saved your energy. If you haven’t, you might not last five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Oh, you really should. It’s quite beautiful.
Allow me.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: As last looks go, you could do worse.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren’s feet</strong>: White socks in wooden clogs, walk
forward, Crunching Snow underneath them…</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the
Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword
in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird….</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with
samurai swords. Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither
humor nor mercy at my blade. Now unless you intend to commit sepeku
among the koi, stand up and fight. You may not be able to fight like a
samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Attack me. With everything you have.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: I apologize for ridiculing you earlier.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Accepted.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cu o-ren ishii</strong>: facing away from the Bride. Sword
still in her hand. We see she doesn’t have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A
touch of her BRAIN is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like
raindrops. The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who’s regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword…</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: I always dreamed of owning one…</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: Did he make it for you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>o-ren</strong>: …He must of liked you.</p>
<p><strong>sofie fatale</strong>: Minus an arm, lies curled up in the
trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.</p>
<p><strong>pov through windshield</strong>: car speeding…then
stopping.</p>
<p><strong>black screen</strong>: The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look
up at her FRAMED in the TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless,
gold Deadly Viper syringe in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ve kept you alive for one reason.
Information. Being O-Ren’s lawyer, I take it you’re familiar with
Bill?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: In fact, I’d guesstimate, you worked for
Bill before O-Ren, and that’s how it is you came to work for O-Ren. Am I
correct?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I thought so. Give me the arm you have
left.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I want information. Now gimme your
arm.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: The cocktail racing through your
bloodstream at this moment is Bill’s own recipe. He calls it “The
Undisputed Truth.”</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Okay, first things first. Where was the
other Yubari sister? Yuki?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Yuki’s sick. She went home early.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Do tell? What’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: She has a cold.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Awwww poor baby. What do you think she’ll
do when she finds out what happened?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: She’ll drink excessively.</p>
<p><strong>back to yuki</strong>: Big bottle of sake in her mouth
pointed bottom up.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: She’ll start trouble.</p>
<p><strong>back to yuki</strong>: sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An
OLDER JAPANESE MAN in a business suit sits next to her at the bar…he
puts the make on her.</p>
<p><strong>business suit</strong>: Do you like Ferraris?</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: Ferrari…Italian trash.</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: Do you find me hot?</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: Don’t laugh! Do you want to fuck me, yes or
no?</p>
<p><strong>business suit</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>two shot yuki and business suit</strong>: Yuki focused,
Business Suit penetrated…She opens him up more…he feels every inch of
the blade’s progress.</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: How bout now, big boy, do you still wish to
penetrate me…</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: Or is it I who has penetrated you.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: When she stops shedding tears, she’ll start
shedding blood.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Best guess, what will she do?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: I don’t hafta guess, she’ll come after
you.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Will she ever give up?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: She won’t have to. When she finds</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Is she more skilled than I?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Skilled won’t be the word.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Don’t be coy with me, bitch. What would
be the word?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Crazy.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Okay, now I want all the information on
the Deadly Vipers,… What they’ve been doing and where I can find
them.</p>
<p><strong>cu sofie</strong>: in a hospital environment. Bill’s voice
speaks to her OFF</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Please forgive my betrayal –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: – no more of that. I invented that truth
serum. Once it entered your bloodstream, you no longer had a choice.</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: But, still –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: – But still – nothing, except my aching heart
over what she’s done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie. If you had to
guess why she left you alive, what would be your guess?</p>
<p><strong>sofie</strong>: Guessing won’t be necessary. She informed
me.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’m allowing you to keep your wicked life
for one reason and one reason only. So you can tell him, in person,
everything that happened here tonight. I want him to witness the extent
of my mercy…, by witnessing your deformed body. I want you to tell him,
all the information you just told me. I want him to know what I know. I
want him to know I want him to know.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: And I want them all to know, they’ll all
soon be as dead as O</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If O-Ren was number one, unless she’s being
tricky, Vernita Green will be number two.</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: Where is Vernita Green?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Los Angeles. Vernita’s in Pasadena. But the
woman you want will hold up in a low budget motel, fifteen of twenty
minutes away from stepping on board a plane departing LAX. If I had to
bet…I’d say Hawthorne.</p>
<p><strong>yuki</strong>: California, here I come.</p>
<p><strong>cu hattori hanzo</strong>: He’s sewing something that
requires a lot of concentration.</p>

<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You don’t know me, but –</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: – And I don’t want to neither. Now</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: – I’ve been shot five times –</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: – Stop, I don’t wanna hear no more. I
got problems of my own.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Then bitch, you better call yourself a
ambulance, cause I don’t do this shit no more.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I can’t call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: – No, you can call a ambulance, you
just don’t want to. But if your ass is really dying, you ain’t got no
motherfuckin choice.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I do have a choice, and I’m choosing to
call you. If you refuse to help me, I’ll die. And that will be your
choice.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Bitch, I don’t even know you!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What do you need to know? I’m from Earth,
I’m a woman, I’m dying, and only you can help me.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Okay, where you at?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’m in Hawthorne. I’m hiding in a kids
treehouse. It’s a street called, “Dimmick”. 1-7-3-6 Dimmick Avenue.
There’s a bunch of police cars and firetrucks, about two blocks
away.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: If you can’t walk, you better crawl.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: You got you some money dontcha, or am I
doin this out of the goodness of my heart?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You come and get me, today’s pay day.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: You ain’t too far away. You gonna bleed
to death I get there in a half a hour?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Okay, I’ll be there in fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Is that Pacific Standard Time, or</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Just you better be there when I get
there, and you better be shot five times, and your bony ass better be on
your last motherfuckin legs.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: How do you know I have a bony ass?</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: You sound like you have a bony ass.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Glad you made it.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: There’s cops all over here, I had to be
cool. They tend to notice things like Negroes sneaking around people’s
backyards.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: This shit’s gonna hurt, and I ain’t got
no anesthetic.</p>
<p><strong>overhead shot</strong>: The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens’
kitchen table, while the nurse extracts the bullets.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That fuckin smarts.</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
future, you should avoid them if you can.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’ll keep that in mind. So, do I have a
future?</p>
<p><strong>nurse owens</strong>: You’ll live to kill again.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Splendid.</p>
<p><strong>ex cu slot in door</strong>: is slid open revealing two male
eyes on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>two eyes</strong>: I heard you had a game?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>two eyes</strong>: They call me Bill.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Bill what?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That, no one ever calls me.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Open the door Alburt, let’s see what
this Bill looks like.</p>
<p><strong>l.f. o’boyle</strong>: Are you a policeman, Bill?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Not anymore?</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Let him play, Alburt.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: We now return to the game already in progress.
The point is nine gentlemen, nine is the point…</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’ll have to.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Now now boys…Mr. Bill, do you intend to start
any shit with that sword?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I give you my word of honor, I will start
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: Miss O’Boyle required a two-hundred dollar
membership fee.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s rather pricey.</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: You wanna play for free, go to Vegas. You
start now you’ll be there by sundown.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I think I’ll stay here. I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Beer.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Twenty dollars for a beer?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: High cost of living shooter. You don’t
like it, go to Vegas. You can</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What am I going to do, I’m thirsty. Pour the
beer.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t get that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Gentlemen, let’s see if the new kid in school
wants to play right away. How bout it new kid, you wanna handle my
bones, or do you just like to watch?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I came to play.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Boys take a look at this man, he’s what
Webster’s calls, a gambler. The dice belong to you , sir.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: I hope you’re not implying anything,
friend?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m not implying anything.</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: That did it fuckhead, you’re out the door
–</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You looked me over when I stood in your
doorway. I’m looking you over as I step up to your table. If I don’t
know, I don’t throw.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Are you satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: I think we’re getting into a antagonistic
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry, I thought you were trying to
take my money, and I was trying to take yours.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: It’s just a game.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If you’re game, take my bet sportsman.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Covered.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shoot it all.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Covered.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: The point is five, gentlemen, five is the
point.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shoot it all.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Covered.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Shoot it all.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Pretty lucky tonight, huh?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Play a game of luck long enough you’re bound
to meet some lucky people.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: You know we’ve never been properly introduced,
I’m L.F. O’Boyle.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: No, you’re rude. Why so rude rude boy, I’m
only trying to be friendly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I didn’t come here to make friends. I came
here to shoot a little crap. But then your boy over there hits me up for
a two hundred dollar privilege to play fee –</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: – That’s a membership fee, good for –</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: So that’s your game, you want to teach me a
lesson?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I wanna burn you down. When I’m through with
you, you won’t have a pot to piss, or a window to throw it out of.
You’ll thumb a ride out of L.A. wearing a barrel.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: I could always save myself this horrible fate
by not taking your bet.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: To be replaced by a different fate. The
embarrassing truth that you run a gutless game. I won’t forget it. I’m
sure these gentlemen won’t forget it. I’m sure they’ll tell people who
won’t forget it. And we won’t come back. If we don’t come back, you
won’t get our money. Couple of weeks, you won’t have a game.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And the idea
of taking everything you’ve won away, and sending you out the door with
nothing but a red face, is so appealing to me, that I will take your
bet. But…..not with those dice.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: The house’s perogative and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Maybe you would like to change your bet?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes I would…..Shoot it all…..Against
myself.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did I stutter, I’m changing my bet. I’m
betting I don’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>alburt</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh yes I can. It’s the shooter’s perogative,
and she knows it.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Covered.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can I use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Sure it’s next to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Game’s over, get out! Get the fuck out! No
more tonight, go home….</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Vernita’s dead? When? What about her family?
Nice to see Kiddo hasn’t gone completely apeshit. No idea where she is?
Okay that did it, we’re going to Texas and talk sense into Budd before
makes him number three.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’re going to have a talk about this
later.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Got a nose problem?</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: I said you could use my phone. I didn’t say I
wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: This is true.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: You didn’t burn me down you know?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Course not. First rule of any house, ya gotta
have LUCKY GUY comes in and wipes the place out insurance.</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: If there weren’t losers it wouldn’t be a
game.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I sincerely hope you mean that.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What L.F. O’Boyle didn’t know was, the
real game was just beginning. Bill was on the job, and she was the
target. Now Bill was the greatest assassin of the 20th century. In fact
the term HITMAN was coined for him. And he rarely performs actual
assassinations anymore. However every once in awhile - to keep his hand
in - he does. Only he plays a game. He doesn’t start big trouble…he lets
them start it. If they do, they’re dead. If they don’t, not only won’t
he perform, he’ll take the hit off the market. It’s kind of fun watching
people gamble when they don’t know they’re gambling, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>l.f.</strong>: Get my money back. Don’t kill him. Chop off
all his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Do you know a Jessica?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, she knows you.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Great day in the morning. Brother Bill livin
up to his familia obligation.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How ya doin’ Budd?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of
wild parties and wealthy women.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch
in the passenger seat?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s Elle. Want to say hello?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Never said “bye,” can’t seem to think of a
reason to say, “hi.”</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: What’d ya wanna talk about?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Are you not going to invite me in?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: May I ask why not?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: It stinks in there, that’s why. Now what’s so
important it requires a reunion?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: You tryin to tell me she cut her way through
eighty-eight bodyguards ’fore she got to O-Ren?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No. There wasn’t really eighty eight of them,
they just called themselves The Crazy 88.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Why.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: She got ’er a Hattori Hanzo sword?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: He made her one? Didn’t he swear a blood oath
never to make another sword?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It would appear he’s broken it.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don’t
they? Or is it just you tend to bring that out in people?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I know this is a ridiculous question before I
ask, but you by any chance haven’t kept up with your swordplay?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Hell, I pawned that years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It was priceless.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Not in El Paso it ain’t. In El Pso I got me
250 Dollars for it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Since it was a gift from me, why didn’t you
offer me the chance to buy it back?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Because that would’ve required me to
acknowledge your existence. Drunken bum though I may be, I don’t need
booze that bad. But who the hell gives a crap anyway. That bitch ain’t
gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me
with a samurai sword. I’m a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. If she wants
to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit,
and we’ll be in a a fight.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: – Budd, you need to listen to me. I know we
haven’t spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn’t
the most pleasant. But you need to get over being mad at me, and start
becoming afraid of Bea. Because she is coming, and she’s coming to kill
you. And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will
succeed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Can’t we forget the past, and look at the
happy side of all this?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: And what would that happy side be?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She’s brought “the boys” back together.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: I appreciate the concern on your face, but
there’s a difference ’tween “the boys”, time can’t erase. I don’t dodge
guilt. And I don’t Jew outta payin my comeuppance. That woman deserves
her revenge. And we deserve to die. But then again, so does she. So I
guess we’ll just see now, won’t we.</p>
<p><strong>ted</strong>: You’re late, Budd, this shit ain’t school, ya
know.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: Hey, Budd.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Hey, Lucky.</p>
<p><strong>stripper</strong>: Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet’s at it
again. There’s shitty water all over the floor.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: I’ll take care of it, Suzie Pie.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Shiner.</p>
<p><strong>sergio leone cu:</strong>: The Bride Blinks.</p>
<p><strong>budd’s pov:</strong>: The Bride laid out in the dirt below
him – Sword separated from her grasp – Bloody mess down her front –
Groan from her throat.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Bet your sweet ass that don’t sting like a
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: …But I don’t wont to neather.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Now I know when it comes to a rock salt burn,
you’re feelin pretty much like a expert bout now. But truth be told, you
ain’t felt all rock salt’s got to offer till you took a double dose in
your backside.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: That gentled ya down, didn’t it? Yep…ain’t
nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their
backyard.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bill?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: ….Budd?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: And what do I owe this dubious pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: I just caught me the cowgirl, ain’t never been
caught.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Do you mean what I think you mean?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: If you think I mean I got ’er, you thought
right.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Not yet I ain’t. But I can sure do it easy
enough. She’s so gentle right now, I could preform her coup de grace
with a rock.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What are you waiting for, run outta liquid
courage.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: No. It’s just…I ain’t killed nobody in a long
Goddamn time. And just ’tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a
promise I wasn’t gonna. Be that however it is. Back when I did kill
people…I got paid for it. Just don’t seem right…turn amateur this time
of life.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Anywho, guess what I’m holdin in my hand right
now.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo sword. And
I’m here to tell ya Elle, that’s what I call sharp.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Oh, that’s hard to say. Seein it’s priceless
and all.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I’ll give you a hundred thousand dollars for
it.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: I’m sure you would. But I’ll take, one
million.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Jeez Budd, who’d ever guess you were such a
capitalist. I thought drunks like yourself were beyond such monetary
concerns?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Well Elle, a million dollars buys a whole
lotta Jack.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Why then are you selling it to a hateful bitch
like me, when you know Bill would pay more?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: If I’m gonna drink myself to death, …it won’t
be on Bill’s dollar. It’s gonna be on yours.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’s the terms?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: You buy a ticket to Texas, and I’ll see you
here tomorrow mornin. You give me a million in foldin cash, I’ll give
you the greatest sword ever made by a man. How’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Sounds like we got a deal. One</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: You kill her tonight. And one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: You said one condition.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: It’s a caveat to the same condition.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She must suffer to her last breath.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: That Elle darlin, I can pretty damwell
guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Then I’ll see you in the morning
millionaire.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Look at those eyes. This bitch is furious. You
grab her feet, I’ll get her head.</p>
<p>****: Got anything to say?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: In America white women call this the silent
treatment. And we let ’em think, we don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at this.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Looky here bitch, this is a can of mace. Now
you’re goin underground tonight, and that’s all there is to it. But,
when I bury ya, I was gonna bury you with this.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: But if you’re gonna act like a horse’s ass,
I’ll spray this whole Goddamn can in your eyeballs. Then you’ll be
blind, burnin, and buried alive. So what’s it gonna be sister?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: You may be stupid, but at least you ain’t
bloody stupid.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Help me.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Well, now that you’ve had a nice, good
cry, let’s figure out how to get out of here? You’re breathing like you
just been fuckin. Calm down…close your mouth, and start breathing short
breaths, through your nose.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: That’s a lot better. But you’re still too
agitated. Can you hear your heart? It’s like I’m buried alive with Buddy
Rich. Turn off that flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No! I can’t turn off the light. Yes you
can. The darkness will have a calming effect. Now turn off that fucking
light.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Yellow?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Didja do it?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Elle darlin, she’s sufferin as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Once upon a time in China, some believe around
the year, one-double knot-three.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: …head priest of The White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei,
was walking down the road, contemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei’s
infinite power would contemplate – Which is another way of saying, who
knows. When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the
opposite direction. As the monk and the priest crossed paths…Pai Mei –
in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the
slightest of nods. The nod, was not returned. Was it the intention of
the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the
generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What
is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at
the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple’s head Abbot offer Pai
Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console
Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable. So began, the massacre
of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists
of the White Lotus. And so began, the legend of Pai Mei’s Ten-Point Palm
- Exploding Heart Technique.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the
martial arts. He hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure
points on your body. And then, he lets you walk away. But once you’ve
taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to
the floor dead.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Did he teach you that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No. He teaches no one the ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique. But he is Nietzsche’s psalm personified. If
Pai Mei doesn’t kill you, he will make you stronger. Now one of the
things I always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your
years. Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. Whatever - WHAT -
EVER - Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash him - even for an instant - a
defiant eye, he’ll pluck it out. And if you throw any American sass his
way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that
will be the story of you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He’ll accept you as his student.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Caught him in a good mood, aye?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: More like a sadistic one.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Just seeing those steps again makes me ache.
You’re gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down
that fucker.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Why did he accept me?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Because he’s a very very very old man. And
like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. Not
that that has any effect on their disposition. But they do learn the
value of company.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: When will I see you again?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s the title of my favorite soul song of
the Seventies.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Nothing. When he tells me you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: When do you think that might be?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That my dearest, all depends on you. Now
remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm. Least not for the first year. You’re
going to have to let him warm up for you. He hates Caucasians, despises
Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that
may take a little while. Adios.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s voice</strong>: Up the stairs, yankee woman!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: More stairs, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s voice</strong>: If it is Christ you seek, turn back
now.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s pov</strong>: We see through Pei Mei’s pupils,
through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Teacher, I am unworthy to be your student
–</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s voice</strong>: Your Mandarin is lousy. I can’t
understand a single word you say. It causes my ears discomfort. You are
not to speak unless spoken to. Do you understand Mandarin any better
than you speak it?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I speak Japanese very well –</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s voice</strong>: I didn’t ask if you speak Japanese,
or Mongolian, for that matter. I asked if you understand Mandarin?</p>
<p><strong>pai mei’s voice</strong>: You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you can’t understand me, I will
communicate with you like I would a dog. When I yell, when I point, When
I beat you with my stick!</p>
<p><strong>we cut to pai mei</strong>: He’s just like he was in the
films earlier. Long White Hair, Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes,
same long flowing White Robe. Everything’s the same, except he’s older,
by about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting area on the
other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Bill is your master, is he not?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes, he is.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Your master tells me you’re not entirely
unschooled. What training do you possess?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I am proficient in a combination of Tiger
and Crane style. And I am more than proficient in the exquisite art of
the Samurai Sword.</p>
<p>****: The exquisite art of the samurai sword. Don’t make me laugh.
Your so called exquisite art, is only fit for Japanese fat heads. You
really are a silly ass.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’m sorry master –</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: – Silence! I do not wish to hear your
unintelligible excuses.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Your anger amuses me. Do you believe you
are my match?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Are you aware I kill at will?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Is it your wish to die?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Then you must be stupid. Rise stupid, and
let me get a better</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: You breathe hard. The one hundred steps
robbed you of your wind. So your stupidity is matched only by your
weakness. Is there anything you do well? – Oh yes, you speak Japanese. I
despise the Goddamn Japs. I would of thought an American would be immune
to their pompous posturing. Apparently I was wrong. Go to that
drawer.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Remove the sword.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Let’s see how good you really are. Try and
land a blow. If you land a single blow, I’ll bow down and call you
master.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Come now woman, can’t you even hit an old
man?</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Your ability really is quite poor.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Ha ha ha ha ha! I’ve fought cripples who
posed more of a challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: From here you can get an excellent view of
my foot.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Give up? Or care to try again?</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: That blade’s sharp. Careful not to cut off
your own arm.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: If you can’t fight any better than that,
what use do you have for a leg?</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Now that really would be a shame.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Your swordsmanship is amateur at best.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: I’m a hundred and fifty years old, and you
can’t even make me break a sweat.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Let’s see your Tiger and Crane style match
my Eagles’s Claw.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: …pathetic…..terrible…you idiot, you
should’ve landed that blow…you call that crane?… Enough, I grow
bored.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: I asked you to show me what you know, and
you did. Not a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Like all yankee women, the only thing you
know how to do is order</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Excruciating isn’t it? I asked you a
question!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: I could chop off your arm at will. I think
I shall.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No please don’t!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: If you wish to speak romantic languages,
you’ve come to the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Please don’t cut my arm off!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: It’s my arm now. I can do with it what I
please. If you can stop me, I suggest you try.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Because you’re helpless?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Have you ever felt this before?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Compared to me you’re as helpless as a worm
fighting an eagle, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes!!!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Is it your wish to learn how to make others
as helpless as you were?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Can you cook?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: I’ll be the judge of that. Draw me a
bath…your training will begin tomorrow. That arm is still mine. You may
lose it yet.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it
strong. Can you do that?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I can, but not that close.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Then you can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I can put my hand through that at six
inches.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: And you could shoot a man from a rooftop
with a scope-sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what I
asked. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you
do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through him.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Now begin.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: If you want to eat like a dog, I will make
you live and sleep like a dog. Outside. If you want to live and sleep
like a human being, pick up those sticks.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: It’s the wood that should fear your hand,
not the other way around. No wonder you can’t do it, you acquiesce to
defeat before you even begin.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: In that pit, is a rat.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: In the sky, is a bird.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: You are to go into that pit, and catch that
rat, with your bare hands. If you catch the rat, I will deem you the
victor, and tonight you will dine on bird. But, if you can’t catch the
rat by sundown, I’ll deem the victor the rat. And because of the
disgrace to my student, I will be forced to kill it. And then I will
force you, to consume his body. Because to be my student, you must
develop a taste for victory.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I acknowledge defeat at the paws of this
rat. However, I will not eat this filthy vermin. What I will do… …is
consume his victorious heart. But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: How does victory taste?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bitter.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Woman, is that you who disturbs my
meditation?</p>
<p><strong>the bride’s voice</strong>: Yes, teacher.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Enter.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: What news do you find so worthy, as to
disrupt my bath?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I did it teacher. I put my fist through
the wall.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Very good. Would you care to
demonstrate?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I think you watching is making me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Not only that, it has you speaking before
you were spoken to. Try again.</p>
<p><strong>cu pai mei</strong>: he says in ENGLISH;</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Impressive.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Thank you teacher –</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: You still fight better than you speak.
Finally, a woman who understands what’s important.</p>
<p><strong>pai mei</strong>: Begin again.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk’s pov:</strong>: Through the picture window, we see
the Bride, emerge from the Texas night, and walk towards the diner
looking for all the world like a six-foot tall female version of the
Peanuts character “PIG PEN.” With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I’d like a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>cu elle driver</strong>: Behind the wheel of a hot black and
gold Trans Am, driving full out on top of the desert’s surface. Spanish
Rock coming</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Want some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: …So that’s called a Texas funeral?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I got to give it to ya Budd, that’s a pretty
fucked up way to die. What’s the name on the grave she’s buried
under?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Paula Schultz.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: That’s my money in that black case, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Sure is.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Well then, it’s your sword now.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: That’s a Hanzo sword alright.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bill tells me you once had one of your
own.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Once.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: How does this one compare to that one?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: If you’re gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you
compare it to every</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: So, which “R” you filled with?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: They say the number one killer of old people
is retirement. People got’em a job to do, they tend to live a little
longer so they can do it. I’ve always figured warriors and their enemies
share the same relationship. So now you ain’t gonna hafta face your
enemy on the battlefield no more, which “R” are you filled with, Relief
or Regret?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: A little bit of both.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Bullshit. I’m sure you do feel a little bit of
both. But I know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other.
The question was which one?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Regret.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol’ girl. I
never saw nobody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill. Bill useta
think she was so damn smart. I tried to tell him… Bill, she’s just smart
for a blonde.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Want your money?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: Great day in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry Budd, that was rude of me wasn’t
it? Budd – I’d like to introduce my friend, The Black Mamba. Black Mamba
– this is Budd. You know before I picked up that little fella, I looked
him up on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Now in these last agonizing minutes of life
you have left, let me answer the question you asked earlier, more
thoroughly. When it comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta “R’s” in me.
Revenge is one. Retribution is another. Rivalry is definitely one. But I
got another</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bill…Elle. I have some tragic news. Your
brother’s dead. I’m sorry baby.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: She put a Black Mamba in his camper. I got
her, sweety. She’s dead. Let me put it this way. If you ever start
feeling sentimental, go to Austin, Texas. When you get here, walk into a
florist and buy a bunch of flowers. Then you take those flowers to
Huntington cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone
marked “Paula Schultz”, then lay them on the grave. Because you will be
standing at the final resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.</p>

about four hours, should I come over? No no no no no, you need me baby.
I’m there. Okay, I’m leaving now, go smoke some pot or something. I’ll
be there soon.</p>

English words; “To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill.”</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that alacky had
got the best of you.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You thought wrong.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Budd’s Hanzo sword.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: He said he pawned it.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Guess that makes him a liar, don’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Elle?</p>

SNATCHING out Elle’s eye with his Eagle’s Claw.</p>

<p><strong>elle</strong>: Were I to do it over again, I’d bite my
tongue.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: One more question?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Where’s Bill?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Villa Quatro.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Gulf of Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You wouldn’t lie to me now?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: Why lie?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I saw what you did to that little Mamba
in there. Want to try that on somebody your own size?</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh Elle, I should warn you before we get
started. Hattori Hanzo swords are extremely sharp. They can take a
little getting used to. Careful not to cut your own arm off.</p>
<p><strong>elle</strong>: I don’t rattle, bitch!</p>

bleed a lot.</p>

and spread them around the house, if you would.</p>
<p><strong>josephina</strong>: Yes, Mr. Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know I just had a great idea. Take the
roses, and spread the petals on the bed I just got for her. That’d be a
nice thing to come home to, wouldn’t it, a bed of roses.</p>

lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE</p>

her wide-eyed coma state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND
NURSES performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is

<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hola.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hello Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Kiddo, is that really you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh, it’s me all right.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I hear you were driving a truck?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: My pussy wagon died on me. Who’s your
little friend?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh, you mean the little tow head next to me,
who looks extraordinarily like you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yeah, that one.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Her name is B.B.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes. Do you approve?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes. Can she hear us?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Not now, she’s in dream land.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: How old is she?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: How many years has she been alive?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t ask how old she is, ask, if she’s
five.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Is she five?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Aren’t mothers like God, aren’t you supposed
to automatically know?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I did and I do. I want to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight.
She’s expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I knew you were on your way, so I told B.B.
Her mommy was coming to see her.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What have you told her about me?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That you were sick, that you were asleep, but
one day you’d wake up and come back to her. And she asked me, “If
Mommy’s been asleep since I was born, how will she know what I look
like?” To which I replied, “Because Mommy’s been dreaming of you.” And
she said, “Then I’m gonna start dreaming of her.” So I gave her a</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: – which one?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: The one I took of you in Paris, sitting on the
steps with the baguette in your hand. Since she was one and a half years
old, she’s slept with that picture of you next to her bed.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You know, prettier photos of me do
exist.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And she’s seen them. But the one she wants
looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread. We
normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: When do we cross swords?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes
with its very own private beach. And my private beach, just so happens
to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. And there just so
happens to be a full moon out tonight. So, swordfighter, if you</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Do me a courtesy?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Slow down as we pass…I want another look
at her.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Wear something nice tonight?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I have a dress all picked out.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Will I like it?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You said I looked beautiful last time you
saw me in it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’ll dress up too.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You fucking maricone!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Now you just wait one second there little
missy. Unless I’m confused, we are trying to kill each other aren’t we?
Now I wasn’t planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt,
but, she is asleep. And if you’re gonna forget everything I ever taught
you, and gawk like you ain’t got good sense, I’m gonna take a shot, am I
not?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Did she wake up?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Of course not. She’s like you that way. I look
forward to this evening. It was great speaking with you, Bea.</p>

<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: Beatrix, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: She’s alive! My baby girl’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>hanzo</strong>: Half of Bill’s strength, lies in his talent
for the unexpected. If you intend to vanquish this man, and claim your
daughter, you must not only expect the unexpected. You must do the
unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hello Josephina.</p>

<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Stay in here and don’t come out. If you
leave this room I’ll shoot you, comprende?</p>
<p><strong>josephina</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bill’s voice</strong>: Kiddo! If you’re through shooting the
servants, I’m in the living room. You remember how to get to the living
room, don’tcha? Go down to the end of the hall, and make a left.</p>

<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You are-the
fastest.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But…little did Quick Draw Kiddo know,…that
five-year-old B.B. Gunn was only playing possum, due to the fact she was
impervious to bullets.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Hey, get back down there, you’re playing
possum.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So, as the smirking killer approached, what
she thought, was a bullet-ridden corpse,…that’s when the little B.B.
Gunn fired.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Bang bang!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mommy, you’re dead - so die.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
known, you are the best.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Don’t die Mommy, I was just playing.</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: I know baby.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: I waited a long time for you to wake up,
Mommy. Did you dream of me - I dreamed of you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Every single night, baby.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Now let me look at you. My my my… What a
pretty girl you are.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: You’re pretty too, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: When I showed you Mommy’s picture, tell Mommy
what you said.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: I said - I said - You’re the most beautiful
woman I ever saw in the whole white world.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s the truth. That’s what she said.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: Oh, Mommy spilled something on her dress.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Blood?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Do you not like it, or do you not know what it
is?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: I do not know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: Well, it’s a very tasty beverage that I used
to drink, when I was a little girl. It comes in a lot of different
flavors and colors, and it’s really good. Maybe we should fix some
sometime. Want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I
think it’s dinner time don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you
didn’t happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old,
did ya?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Whew, then dinner should be done. Josephina!
You can come out now, we’re ready for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>josephina</strong>: Yes, Mr. Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Want to go on top of the world?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: B.B., don’t you think Mommy has the prettiest
hair in the whole wide world?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: In fact it’s better than pretty. What’s better
than pretty?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know baby, Mommy’s kinda mad at Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy. Our
little girl learned about life and death the other day. You want to tell
Mommy about what happened to Emilio?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: I killed him. I didn’t mean to, but I stepped
on him and he stopped moving.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Emilio was her goldfish. She came running into
my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, “Daddy daddy, Emilio’s
dead.” And I said, “Really, that’s so sad. How did he die?” And what did
you say?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: I stepped on him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Actually young lady, the words you so
strategically used were, “I accidentally stepped on him.” Right?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: To which I queried, “And just how did your
foot accidentally find its way into Emilio’s fishbowl?” And she told me
no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. Hummmmmm,
the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: He was – flapping.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And then you stomped on him?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And when you lifted your foot up, what was
Emilio doing then?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: He stopped flapping, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And you knew what that meant, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What did that mean?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: He was dead.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: She told me later, that the second she lifted
up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not
the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the
carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a
five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it
meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed
him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her
little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better.
And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn’t
know. But I knew why. You didn’t mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to
see what would happen if you stepped on him, right?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is
you kill him. And you discovered that, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: So we drove down to the beach, had a little
funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea. And right now I’m sure he’s
happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. But the point being, our
child learned two very important lessons. One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: You stomped on Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Worse. I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like
we were just doing. I shot her for real.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Did you want to see what would happen?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, I knew what would happen to Mommy if I
shot her. What I didn’t know, is when I shot Mommy, what would happen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I was very sad. And that was when I learned,
somethings once you do, they can never be undone.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: What happened to Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why don’t you ask Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No sweety, it doesn’t hurt anymore.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: Did it make you sick?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: It put me to sleep. That’s why I haven’t been
with you B.B., I’ve been asleep.</p>
<p><strong>b.b.</strong>: But you’re awake now, right?</p>
<p><strong>mommy</strong>: I’m wide awake, pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Did she go to sleep easy?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It took her a little bit. She was
excited. She’s quite the little chatterbox.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, if she doesn’t like you, you got to kill
her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can’t shut her up. She’s a
chip off the ole blonde in that regards.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Red wine?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: C’mon, Bea, you’re a whole lot more fun with a
couple glasses of wine in ya.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We’re going to go out there and have at it,
aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, I’ve already had a glass. So unless you
want to win by an unfair advantage, you should have a glass of wine. So
we’re both on the same footing wine wise.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know, there’s an old man down here, his
name is Esteban Viharo. He was a pimp. I knew him when I was a child. He
was a friend of my mother’s. I told him about you. When I showed him
your picture he smiles and said; “Yesss, I see the attraction.” He told
me a story about taking me to the movies when I was five. It was a movie
which had Lana Turner in it. And whenever she would appear on screen, he
said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure
amount. And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Who would of ever thought you’d be such a
good father?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well not you, that’s for damn sure.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Must we have to endure your little
zingers?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No we mustn’t. But if you’re going to say
sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the temptation.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Baby, you don’t have a future.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I sent you to L.A. and you never came back. I
thought you’d been killed. Do you know how cruel it is to make someone
think someone they love is dead? I mourned you. Then in the third month
of my mourning, I track you down. I wasn’t trying to track you down, I
was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed
you. And when I find you, what to I find? Not only are you not dead,
you’re getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you’re pregnant? How
do you expect me to react?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Why do you think I hid?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why did you leave in the first place? You have
cold eyes towards me now. I understand their temperature, but they were
warm the second to the last time I saw them, or was that just my
imagination?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You sent me to L.A. to kill that lady
scoundrel, Lisa Wong.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You are you talking in Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: What the hell do you care what I talk in?
Don’t you know when to keep your mouth shut? I’m trying to tell you what
you want to know, if you’ll just shut up and listen and stop talking!
Now may I continue?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You’re right, I’m wrong, continue.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: The morning I left, I threw up. I don’t
feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, I threw up. When
I got to my hotel, I threw up. So naturally I started thinking, maybe I
might be pregnant. So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits. Went
back to my room and took the test. The little strip said blue. I was
going to have a baby. I tried to call you, but you weren’t there, so I
just thought I’d call back later.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But you never did.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: - Would you shut up, I’m trying to tell
you how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: My apologies, please continue.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: So I just figured I’d call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put on music and danced by myself in the
hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. What I didn’t know, was at
some leg of my journey, I was spotted. With me in Los Angeles it didn’t
take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. So she
sent an assassin of her own to</p>
<p><strong>peephole pov</strong>: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer
and skirt outfit of a hotel manager. She’s holding a basket of
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Hello, can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>hotel woman</strong>: Hello, I’m Karen Kim, I’m the
hospitality manager of the hotel. I have a welcome gift from the
management.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Oh, it’s beautiful. But I’m kinda busy at
this second, could you possibly come back later?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh? Well
that’s my sister, bitch. I’m Karen Wong, and I’ve come here to kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Wait a second!</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes, I’m an assassin. Yes I did come here
to kill your sister. But I’m not gonna do that now.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, I know you’re not –</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: - listen to me! I just found out, right
now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, I’m
pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: On that table is the home pregnancy kit.
On the floor by the door is the strip that says I’m pregnant. I’m
telling you the truth, I don’t want to and I won’t kill your sister. I
just want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What is this, bullshit story number twelve in
the female assassin’s handbook?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Any other time you’d be a hundred percent
right. But this time you’re a hundred percent wrong. I’m the deadliest
woman in the world, but right now I’m scared shitless for my baby.
Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it’s on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sit down on that bed and put your hands
behind your head.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Blue means pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’ll read it myself, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay, say I were to believe you, what
then?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Just go home. I’ll do the same.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You fucked with the Wong sisters.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Facing Karen Wong, was the most
frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three
years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I
was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you.
Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a
speeding train …for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no
longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother.
A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don’t harm my
baby. Can you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Yes. But why tell me now, and not then?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You wouldn’t have let me go. Specially
once you found out I was pregnant. You would’ve tried to talk me out of
it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fuck who?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Bill, you couldn’t know I was pregnant,
once you knew, you’d claim it, and I didn’t want that.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s not your decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes, but it’s the right decision. And I
made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with
a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she
shouldn’t be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would
be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You know five years ago, if I had to make
a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a
coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the
top of the list. I’d’ve been wrong, wouldn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m sorry was that a question? Of impossible
things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have
been wrong.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well what?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Explain yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I already have. When I told you the story of
when I thought you were dead. Didn’t you get how badly I felt?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You call that an explanation?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well if that’s too cryptic let’s get literal.
There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. You
experienced some of them.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: You and I have unfinished business.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Baby, you ain’t kidding.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know how proud I am of you, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know I was rooting for you, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I figured.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You know on that beach out there I want you to
be the victor?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You also know you’re going to have to defeat
me. I can’t just give it to you, even though I want to.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: It won’t be necessary for you to give me
anything. I’ve surpassed you. I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Well, as they say in Missouri, show me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: stares across the sand to the figure of the
Bride, his student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up. Facing a
Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He removes his Hanzo sword
from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: The two combatants…quite far from each
other…they intend to charge/attack…stand in showdown stance.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Attack me.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: Of course he did.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>the bride</strong>: I don’t know…Because…I’m a…bad
person.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No. You’re not a bad person. You’re a terrific
person. You’re my favorite person. But every once in awhile…you can be a
real cunt.</p>
<p><strong>series of shots end film</strong>: As a female voice sings a
song on the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>two shot cu</strong>: Both blonde heads, the big one and the
little one, next to each other, watching T.V.</p>
