<p><strong>lt</strong>: How many times are you gonna miss the bus? Huh?
All the other kids can get up in the morning, but you guys wanna be
driven around like the fucking President. I’m your goddamn
chauffeur!</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: Shit, man. It wasn’t our fault! – You think
Sis is so perfect, well, if she hadn’t hogged the fucking bathroom,
maybe we – I thought Aunt Lu was dead! She was in there so long…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Shut up! Listen!</p>
<p><strong>on radio</strong>: Chatter about Mets winning last night’s
game. It was the THIRD GAME straight that they’ve won so far. One more
game – set for tomorrow afternoon – and the Mets will sweep the World
Series. All listen.</p>
<p><strong>twin</strong>: They’re gonna win the Series in four!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: All the way with Strawberry!</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: Strawberry!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Shit, man – there’s your fucking bus I oughtta
make you late! Make the nuns whack the shit outa ya both.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Get going.</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: Two Black kids came up out of nowhere and
shot those chicks. Then they laughed as they walked away. The Press is
gonna call it the “Giggling Man Murders.” I’ll tell ya. What a
world.</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: But hey – we make the best of it, man,
don’t we? Huh? How about them Mets!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: No fucking way they’re gonna do it in four games
straight.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: You serious, man? I wanna go Mets all the
way!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Go ahead, man.If you’ve got shit for brains. But
if you wanna win the bucks, go with Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: I thought Strawberry was gonna –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I know that nigger like he’s my brother. He
ain’t gonna let us off so easy. He’ll make us sweat first. This game’s
going to Oakland. Not a doubt in my mind, man.</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: I’m in. Here.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit
money. We’ll cover the $800.</p>
<p>****: All right. What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I want 15 on the Mets.</p>
<p>****: How about 7 1/2?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Hey, man. Don’t give me that bullshit. Don’t
pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some
money.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah. I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Police! Police! Help me! Police!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Hey, man, gimme something cooked!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: It’s good shit. From when they busted those
Columbians uptown. You can cut it in half.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I got this guy. But there’s someone across the
street on the roof!</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: That stuff’ll kill you quick, man.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a
drug dealer? And you don’t even do your own product! What kind of
businessman are you?</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: The rich kind. Jeez, man. The way you smoke that
shit is suicide.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Fuck you. Just give me back a little something
for the road.</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: See you in a coupla days. Have the cash
ready.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Got something good for us?</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: I’m gonna need some bread, man. This ain’t
fair. I’m always here for you, and you can’t even take decent care of
me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You’re two months
behind on the rent, Lieutenant!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper
apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: It’s nothing. This is New York, man… Oh – I
forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of
the developers. It’s a good investment, man. She could make serious
money!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: We’ve been rehearsing a new monologue. From
Shad’s Saint Joan, you know? Bowtay does it wonderfully well.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: All right, Bowtay. Show us your stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: There’s nothing!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Go out and get some Diet Cokes.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Uh, Lieutenant, Sir – The owner says they stole
cash from the register. He was chasing them down the block when I caught
up with them.</p>
<p><strong>young black kid</strong>: We didn’t do nothing, man !</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Shut the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Go get me a Bud. A High Boy. And make sure it’s
fucking cold. I’ll straighten this out.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: How much did they take?</p>
<p><strong>korean owner</strong>: Five hundred dollars cash.</p>
<p><strong>young black kid</strong>: We didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Take this guy down to the Precinct. I need to
talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>int</strong>: The store appears to be deserted.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Gimme the money! Now!</p>
<p><strong>young black kid</strong>: We told you, man. We didn’t take no
–</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Give me the fucking money, assholes!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What the fuck are ya standing there for? Be

<p><strong>lt</strong>: Take over until your boss gets back. Gimme a 6
of Diet Cokes and a 6 of Budweiser.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: I got you a present. Better shit then you

<p><strong>lt</strong>: Brown Downtown… There hasn’t been any smoking
brown on the street in –</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Who said anything about the fucking street.
I’ve got more connects than you have, Lieutenant…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Did I win? Shit! The game!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What’s the score? What’s the fucking score?</p>
<p><strong>ancient aunt</strong>: I dunno…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Why me, man?</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: STRAWBERRY makes a fantastic catch of a
Canseco drive with runners on base. LT CHEERS.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Shut the fuck up! Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: It’s 7-0: Oakland. That nigger could have let
it drop and gone home.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Hey, Veronica baby, looking good! What’s going
down?</p>
<p>****: Willie got shot by one of his boys. But there’s a ki under the
back seat.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’ll put it in my trunk.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I guess he was a bigtime dealer… What d’ya know…
A kilo of ’caine…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Where the fuck did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I can’t fucking believe it…</p>
<p><strong>cop a</strong>: But I still can’t fucking believe they’d rape
a nun, man…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What’s this shit about a nun getting raped?</p>
<p><strong>cop b</strong>: Where the fuck have you been? It happened
this morning, up at St. Dominiek’s in Spanish Harlem. A coupla punks
tore up the place and then gave it to the nuns but good.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: They raped a nun and tore up the church –
they even took a crap on the altar. Up in Spanish Harlem.</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: She was only seventeen…</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: Who the fuck could do this?!</p>
<p><strong>old irish cop</strong>: The young nun’s just a kid from
Ireland. Imagine having to come here to have that happen!</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Jesus… What’s she gonna tell her
mother?</p>
<p><strong>old irish cop</strong>: I’m gonna kill those
motherfuckers.</p>
<p><strong>third cop</strong>: The Church already put up a $50,000
reward!</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: Well, one of us is gonna get it. I mean –
get them.</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: Here’s to payback for the nuns!</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Anyone got any leads, at all?</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: We got shit to go on. Only that list of
inventory – what they stole from the church.</p>
<p><strong>third cop</strong>: Y’know they actually stole those wacky
purple robes? And they took the chalice – with the Host still
inside!</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: What did they want with the Host?</p>
<p><strong>third cop</strong>: They were hungry. I dunno. They didn’t
want to hock the Host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Leave it to the Catholic Church, man. Girls get
raped everyday, and now they’re gonna pay 50 G just because these chicks
wore penguin suits!</p>
<p><strong>old irish cop</strong>: What’s your fucking problem?!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: The Church is a racket.</p>
<p><strong>old irish cop</strong>: So what. Are you a Catholic?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>old irish cop</strong>: Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: To Hell with this God stuff. How’s that
Strawberry? He does what ever you want him to, huh Lieutenant? Even
strike out! I bet you won a shitload on Oakland. How much, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: More than you did.</p>
<p><strong>gambler cop two</strong>: Well, let’s see some green!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: If you know what’s good for you, you’ll keep
staying on Oakland!</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: Oakland? Is that how you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Don’t you get it? The series has
gotta last seven games. The last two did, didn’t they? It’s a racket. Do
you have any idea how much money they make selling television-time for
commercials during the series? Especially if it’s a New York team? They
won’t close the gold mine after only four games. It’ll last a full
seven. Too many people wanna milk it for what it’s worth. You’ll
see!</p>
<p><strong>bet cop</strong>: All right… I’m in. After all, you’re the
expert. Ain’t that right, LT?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: You’ll be sorry, man. But if you wanna be a
sissy, here’s your bread.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Strawberry? I thought we were going with
Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: We are, man! That’s the point! If the Mets win,
it’s thanks to Strawberry. If Oakland wins, it’s thanks to Strawberry.
Nothing can happen out there on the field that don’t gotta do with
Strawberry. So here’s to Strawberry!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’m in charge of the investigation. Just
checking security.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Security?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Do you want those guys coming back? For the nun?
Or for you?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters
into her vaginal aperture, breaking the hymen membrane. Then they
pursued the same course with their natural organs of sexual penetration.
They used a sharp object, probably a hunting knife with a curved blade,
to carve a cross between her shoulder blades, entering the flesh an
average of nearly one centimeter throughout the area of the wound. They
–</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Have you ever seen a naked nun? I tell you, man,
I went to school with the nuns, I’ve seen hundreds since then and I’ve
never even seen a nun’s belly button, you understand? But this nun, let
me tell you. What a beautiful lady… And where’d the Church get the 50 G
in the first place? The fucking Church is the biggest scam going. You
know what’s the real killer? It costs $8,000 per kid for them to go to
parochial school. I’ve got three kids in there already, with two on the
way! Christ. That fucking reward is my money, man! But that’s Church
policy. The Pope is the world’s biggest bookie. Makes people bet on
their own salvation! Double or nothing on Heaven. You go to Hell – then
go to Hell. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: I can’t get over what those guys did to her.
I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: They’re alive, aren’t they? Come on, man!
Everyone’s making such a fucking fuss, just because she’s a nun. Just
because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys
who dared to rape her. Do you think they’d put up a dime if you got
raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like
shit they would.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Susie’s not a virgin anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: She’s fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: And the nun’s not a virgin anymore, either.
Will they make her leave the convent?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Who knows? Who knows what their policy is. But
I’ll tell you, man, that nun… She was beautiful. Just beautiful… Tall…
Real tall… I’ve never seen anything like it…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Lite, man… Where the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: It’s horrible. They burned her breasts with
cigarettes. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah? At least she’s alive! I see people get
killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns
got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone’s all upset about fucking
cigarette burns. I’ll show you cigarette burns!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Do you believe in God? Do you believe that
Jesus Christ is the Son of God?.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah, I know, I know all about it. Enough
already about the fucking nuns. Yeah. Yeah. So just take the bet. Don’t
give me any hassles, man. Just put in my bet. 30 G’s. Yeah. And I got
$900 from the cops on Oakland. Yeah. Right. Strawberry’s gonna knock em
dead. Of course he is! You know that! Yeah. Yeah. Have faith, man! OK.
Right.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they
operate. I’ve been part of the racket since the first time some faggot
priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way
through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I’m free of it and I’m
gonna stay that way.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: I’m not talking about the fucking Church.
Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What’s to believe?</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he
came to die for your sins.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Your sins, Lieutenant! And look around you!
Where do you think all this shit came from?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: People.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: You believe that man is the be-all and
end-all?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: OK. OK. Fine. But – do you believe in
God?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of
Heaven and Earth…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: You wouldn’t put some religious trip on me,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>jersey girl</strong>: Uh-uh… What?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Good. Show me your papers.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Who’s this person? It ain’t you, and it ain’t
you, so who is it?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: My Aunt.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: So you took the car from you Aunt. Stole it. Am
I right?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: We were gonna give it back! We’re on our way
home, now!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Now why don’t I just call up your Aunt right now
and tell her what’s gone down. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Well, I’m sure we could arrange something…
Unless you fancy a few days in jail…</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Can’t you tell us anything? Sisters? Anything
at all?</p>
<p><strong>elderly nun</strong>: They broke my glasses. I didn’t see
anything, but I did hear them. They were young. And there were two of
them. They spoke Spanish. One of them was named Julio.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Julio. Great. There are 20,000 spics named
“Julio”.</p>
<p><strong>elderly nun</strong>: I would tell you more if I could. I am
so sorry, Officers.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: What about you, Sister? Won’t you tell us
anything?</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Listen. One nun is nearly 80 years old.
I’m not from this Church, of course, but I assume they’ll be getting her
a new pair of glasses. Apparently she’s legally blind without them. The
Sister who suffered a rape is just 17. She arrived from Ireland only a
couple of months ago. This – event – is just too much for them to
take!</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Listen. The Church would like to know who
did it just as much as the NYPD. These arrant criminals broke the laws
of man, and the laws of God. The Church wants nothing more than to see
them behind bars. That’s why we’re offering the $50,000 reward to
whomever brings them in. I’m sure our hero will be one of New York’s
Finest.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are
you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I wanna go double or nothing on the next
game.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your
mind?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’m not gonna let that bastard take my money</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Take your money? This guy will blow up your
house and everyone in it!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: There’s just no way the Mets will lose this
game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Fuck Strawberry. You’re gonna end up owing 60
G to a homicidal maniac!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: That’s my problem. Just put in my bet.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has
been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible
sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same
time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Sister, we all know what happened to you
yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about
it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the
confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You
haven’t. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of
guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of…
curiosity or even… pleasure, you mustn’t –</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so –
No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an
appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you
do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: It’s funny, you knew. But the first thing I
think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen.
Maybe that’s because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I also thought of that bread, Father. And of
that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the
cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you
do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: I think of running for help, and falling to
my knees in prayer.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: As I have prayed day and night since the
desecration of this church yesterday morning – and my sin. You see,
Father –</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Yes, Sister?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance
to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but
something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never
use again. My vagina.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Those boys, those sad, raging boys… They came
to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like
all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed. Father. I
knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And
they are good boys.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You knew them? Who were they, Sister? Who
are these boys? What are the names of these – good boys you knew?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I could tell you their names now, and I know
you’d be bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret. But I cannot tell you
their names. For I, too, am bound. As I am bound now to confess my sins.
So listen, Father Listen. I am a nun. What did I give those boys that
they could not have found elsewhere? Nothing. Nothing at all. There were
always two of us in the act. The act was half my own. It does not seem
to me the act was half the act of a once of Christ. It is the lost
chance that will remain on the ledger of my sins. Not the loss of my
virginity. The rape forced upon me a choice. As a vessel of the spirit.
I could have imbued my vagina with God. Or, I could have turned away
from God and voided my body of spirit, so that all that was left for
those boys was a lump of flesh. I chose the second path. The easier,
path. The path of the material world. The path no nun has the right to
take. And so, I sinned. My vagina spread, but spread no word. It opened,
on nothingness. It gave nothing at all and left nothing behind. No trace
of my act, yes my act. For I was there, too, remains in the landscape of
God.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Jesus turned water to wine. I ought to have
turned bitter semen to fertile sperm – hatred to love. And maybe to have
saved their souls. They did not love me. I ought to have loved them. As
Jesus loved those who reviled him. I ought to have surprised those boys.
Instead, they surprised me, and got no surprise at all. No, they did not
rape a nun. But a nun has been raped. And the nun must now atone for her
sin. For a God-given part of her was wasted. A part which other women
use for procreation, for conjugal fulfillment, for expressions of love.
I had but one chance. And I did nothing but react in pain. When those
boys placed their hands upon my breasts, they had nothing but an
assortment of skin cells in their grasp. They ought to have felt,
through me. The bosom of their Redeemer. When they lay on top of me and
looked down into my eyes, they saw fear. They should have met the eyes
of a lover, And felt the presence of the Prince of Peace… My vagina. I
shall never have again. And never again shall I encounter two boys whose
prayer was more legible, more poignant, more anguished. Two young men
who threw themselves upon the altar and took me with them. And I did
nothing for them. I can only hope that someone will.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Do you have the money?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What money?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Don’t bullshit me.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I don’t got it. Not tonight. You can’t get blood
from a stone.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: This psycho can.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Oooo… Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000
on tomorrow’s game.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You’re a fucking joke, you know that? He’s
been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I’ve been
waiting here since – forget it. Listen up. You’re gonna get us both
fucking killed. You know that!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Uh-uh. I’m gonna win. Just make sure the bet
gets in.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You do know that he’s gonna blow up your
house, kill your wife and kids –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Good. I’ll give him an extra 10 grand for his
trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and –</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: He’s gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me,
motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’ve been dodging bullets since I was fourteen.
No one can kill me. I’m fucking blessed. I’m fucking Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: How’s the case going?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: What case?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped
that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We’re on it bigtime. Lots of
leads. You bet.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: That 50 G could help you –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: The Mets are gonna win the Series. They’re a
lock.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to
fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know
what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed
and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we
understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and
that he’s saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for
the very first time that –</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You’ve really got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: – that there was never any other way it could
have gone. Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking
bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a
bookmaker, or fucking what?</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: Here. Look I’ll give you the psyho’s number
You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: You couldn’t pay 60. You lose, you’ll be in
for 180. To a guy who kills people for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lite</strong>: I was supposed to meet him at midnight with
the 60. It’s already 1:00 AM. Be careful. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: How are you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: I know. Here. Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: This should be it. Oh, wait. Mamacita?</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: There. Now you’ve got your profit and more.
You’ll have more product day after tomorrow, right?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jc</strong>: I know. Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be
cool.</p>
<p>****: Hey motherfucker! Take that backfire up the ass!</p>
<p>****: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Someone just took a shot at me…</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Sure, baby Sure And you don’t do cocaine,
either.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: It’s not the drugs, Ariane, it’s – it’s someone
who wants to kill me. You gotta believe me!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Just kick back, baby. Make yourself at home. But
of course it won’t be nobody’s home, if you don’t come through with the
fucking rent!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Hello? Is LARGE there?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Look, man. Lite gave ne this number. OK? Just
take a message. Tell Large to fucking call me right away at 123- 1234.
Got it?</p>
<p><strong>mob voice</strong>: Sure, I get it…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’m a good friend of Lite’s, man. It’s urgent
that –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare
hands.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Those fucking Mob assholes.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: C’mere. You got some good blow, right?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Then c’mere. I got something for you.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: First I’ll put your Uptown in the spoon,
then, to make it more exciting, I’m gonna add some Downtown. They call
this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that… First time
shooting up?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Nah…</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Sure it is. You’re a virgin. Just like that
nun. And I’m gonna rape you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Large?</p>
<p>****: All right, cop. I want my money.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: It’s still my money. If you want to have a
chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on
tomorrow’s game.</p>
<p>****: What about the money you owe me on yesterday’s game?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Fuck yesterday’s game. The World Series is seven
games not six. Put in my bet.</p>
<p>****: Let me think about it.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: There’s nothing to think about. Either you put
in my bet or you ain’t getting nothing.</p>
<p><strong>large</strong>: Oh, really?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah, really. I’m no fucking asshole, man. I’m a
fucking cop!</p>
<p>****: OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the
force a message. Tell them I’ve got my own reasons to be very interested
in whomever did the job on the nuns. I’ll double the Church reward if
you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Fuck the nuns, man! I’m talking about
Strawberry! Is the bet down?</p>
<p>****: Here’s the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden.
33rd &amp; 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We’ll listen to
the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I’ll bring mine.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Yeah, sucker. You better be there!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy?
He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some
guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man…</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I
turn then over direct to him.</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: But you could do it, baby. We could use the
bread…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: You mean you could use it.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I’ll
get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids’ll go to jail. I’ll be in
charge, of course. After a little while, I’ll break the fuckers out –
and I’ll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his
100 G. No. I’ll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it – ’cause
I’ve got the kids. Then, of course, there’s the 180 G I’m gonna pick up
on the Game tonight – when the Strawberries win!</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: “The Strawberries”?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for
the Game. Jesus Christ! That’s almost half a million dollars. Ariane!
Wait. That’s not good enough, I’ll ask the shithead for 280 G for the
kids. Then it’ll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the
kids. Yeah, it’s good I prepared, or I wouldn’t have thought to –</p>
<p><strong>ariane</strong>: How come all those guys who’re looking to
get 50 from the Church haven’t come up with shit? You got some kinda
inside track?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I’m a Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Listen to me, Sister, listen to me good. The
other cops’ll just put the guys through the system. They’re juveniles.
They’ll walk! Get it? But I’ll beat the system and do justice. Real
justice. For you.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I have already forgiven them.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Come on lady! They put out cigarettes on your
tits, man! Get with the program! Don’t you want them behind bars? Or
away from the world for good? How could you forgive these motherfu –
excuse me. These guys. How could you? Deep down, don’t you want them to
pay for what they did to you? Don’t you want the crime avenged?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I have forgiven them.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Nun! These boys still have their weapons,
Sister. Your forgiveness will leave blood in its wake. What if they do
it to other nuns? Other virgins? Old women who die from the shock? Do
you have the rights let these boys go free? Can you bear the burden.
Sister?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: I have prayed for days, Lieutenant. I have
prayed for the souls of the boys who raped me. And I have prayed for my
own soul, too. I know what I must do. And I know what I must not do. But
you – you – it is you who needs to pray. Now, why do you want to kill
these boys? Why – really?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Look. Sister. No one has to get killed. We can
solve this together. You and me – as one. These boys are lost sheep.
Both Catholic – did you know that? And they’re sick, Sister. With a
stress of the mind and of the soul. They need help. Not just jail. Not
just psychiatry. They need the help that only the Church can give.
Please help me to help them. Help me find them before the others do. The
night is full of evil men, chasing these boys with guns and clubs. We
have charity and love on our side. I know that together, we could find
them first, even in the dark…</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: The good reasons are not always the real
reasons. Talk to Jesus, Lieutenant. Pray. You do you believe in God –
don’t you? That Jesus Christ died for your sins?</p>
<p>****: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Me?</p>
<p>****: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: You can’t forgive me. After what I’ve done. I’ve
fucked up bigtime. I’ve been bad. Real bad.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Please. Please don’t forgive me. I’ve always
hated you for that.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Why? Why can’t you hate me? Hate me! Please!
Help me! Hate me! Help me! Hate me!</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can’t I wash the ashes
from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk
on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why
can’t I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of
thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was
you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Why do I dream every night of the whore who
brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten
that if she, then I –</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Oh God, my God. it’s goddamn good to be good.
Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It’s still goddamn good to be
good.</p>
<p><strong>jesus</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: The chalice. Tell me! Who gave it to you! Tell
me where the fuck you got it! Take me there! Now!</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: In the name of God, you must.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: My husband will give me Hell,
Mister.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: We’ve already got Hell, Sister.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: It’s very hard. He’s a – you’re
not a cop, are you?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: No. Not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: My husband is a fence. He got
this chalice from a couple of kids. Just yesterday, I think. I stole it
out of his shop so as to return it to where it ought to be. It’s a holy
thing, you know. A holy thing.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: A holy thing. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: You took the chalice.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: You brought it back to the Church. And then
it made it’s way back to me, again.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: Are you all right, honey?</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: I was gonna bring it back myself.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: Jesus, woman! What did you think? You thought
I’d get mad like I did that time you took that set of pots and pans?
That was twenty years ago. And how do you compare pots and pans and a
chalice?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: They both hold stuff you eat.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: So what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>elderly black woman</strong>: He wants to know who brought in
the chalice.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: That’s no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it
in, You don’t want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell
have got something coming, but it ain’t what the Law wants to give them.
You understand? No. How could you understand.</p>
<p><strong>fence</strong>: Well – maybe you do. But I don’t know where
those boys are at right now. You’ll have to ask around. Those boys on
the corner’ll know. You’ll have to get it out of them. But they
know.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Thank you. And I’ll make sure the chalice gets
back where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Hey – Have you seen Paolo or Julio around?</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: What the fuck you want.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: You know, my Uncle used to wear a walkman all
the time. The walkman looked just like yours. And you look something
like my Uncle. But one day he was standing in a puddle – the puddle
locked just like that one –</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: And he got electrocuted.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Look – I don’t know you, and you don’t know me,
but I’m really in the mood to kill someone today and you are at the end
of my gun. Have you ever had days like that? Yeah, you have, so now you
understand where I’m coming from. Tell me! Where is Julio and Paolo
?</p>
<p><strong>street dealer</strong>: They were at that abandoned building
last night. Second floor. They’re probably still there now. It’s next to
the old Convent. Downtown a ways. You know the place…</p>
<p><strong>julio</strong>: Who the fu–</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Shut up. Let’s watch the game.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Strawberry…</p>
<p><strong>paolo</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Give me the robes.</p>
<p><strong>julio</strong>: You’re not a cop are you?</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Jesus died for your sins, you motherfuckers! Not
me. No. I didn’t die for your sins. No, not me. Jesus went and did it.
So why did you do what you did? If you want to live, tell me now,
motherfuckers! Tell me now!</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>at the bus</strong>: He makes them board at GUN POINT.</p>
<p><strong>lt</strong>: If you think you’re not getting on this bus,
you’re dead wrong. No fucking way are you gonna miss this bus, man! You
were probably the kind of kids who had your father drive you to school
cause you couldn’t catch the fucking bus. But no more, man. You’re
getting on this bus and you’re taking it to the last fucking stop. So
get on the fucking bus, man, ’cause you’re life ain’t worth shit in this
town.</p>
<p><strong>int</strong>: STRAWBERRY is up. The GAME can go either way.
Suspense.</p>
