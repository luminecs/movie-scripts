<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Get up, now! Up!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Roger, Restitution. We are standing by for
delivery.</p>
<p><strong>fade to black</strong>: The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet. Forks
clanking against plates and the din of a hundred conversations, broken
by…</p>
<p><strong>super title</strong>: "MOSCOW - THREE WEEKS LATER</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: Thank you for joining us this evening.</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: Tonight we are honored to have with us a
man of remarkable courage, who, despite strong international
criticism…</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: Has chosen to join our fight against
tyranny in forging a new world community. Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the President of the United States of America…</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: Maybe we should consider running him for
re-election instead of the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Good evening and thank you. First I would
ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the
Turkmenistan massacres.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: As you know, three weeks ago American
Special Forces, in cooperation with the Russian Republican Army, secured
the arrest of Turkmenistan’s self- proclaimed dictator, General Ivan
Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the
word horror. I am proud to say our operation was a success.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And now, yesterday’s biggest threat to
world peace… today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What we did here was important. We finally
pulled our heads out of the sand, we finally stood up to the brutality
and said "We’ve had enough. Every time we ignore these atrocities– the
rapes, the death squads, the genocides- every time we negotiate with
these, these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away from gig
families, every time we do thiS.E. we legitimize terror.</p>
<p><strong>air force one</strong>: The President’s own Boeing 747-200,
dubbed "the flying White House". The distinctive royal blue stripe over
a thin gold line tapers to a tail adorned with the American flag and the
Presidential Seal Secret Service agents and Marines stand guard at the
aircraft’s perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: We’ve already been inspected.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Sir, this plane carries the President of the
United States.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Of course. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Please place your thumbs on the ID pad.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: CBS said they’ll</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I always wondered if my freshman Russian
class would come in handy.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: Sir, you threw out page two.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Goddamn right I did. I asked for a
tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit. What’s the
point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: It was a good ad-lib, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Thanks. Wrote it last night.</p>
<p><strong>walters</strong>: Equipment checks out.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally meet you
in person.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: The President and I were delighted that we
could accommodate you. Now if you’re all cleared? You can follow me
then.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’ll be giving</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: You wanna knock of f?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No, no. I’m fine. What did the Speaker
say?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: He and the NRA don’t like the wording.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: Apparently taking uzis away from sixth
graders isn’t as popular as we thought it’d be. Representative Taylor is
working on a compromise.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Put together a score sheet. I’ll make some
calls.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: With all due respect, sir, maybe you
should give them this one. Your numbers are still pretty low and you
called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I might still have a few chips left.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: We could always</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing a
couple ducks won’t get it through committee. Besides, Shep, I told you…
I don’t shoot babies and I don’t kiss guns.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Other way around, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Right… Christ I’m tired. Do me a favor and
keep me away from the press.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: … and your reaction to the President’s
trip to Moscow. Good or bad?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: This is the part I wanted you to see.</p>
<p><strong>rep. danforth</strong>: Criminal. One of our boys died in
Marshall’s little publicity stunt and for what? So we could claim
victory over another country’s problems instead of our own? And now he’s
got the nerve to prance around Moscow gloating, while that poor boy’s
family is left to bury him. If I were Marshall, I’d be ashamed of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>larry king</strong>: There you have it. Harsh words for the
President from Michael Danforth, the Speaker of the House.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: My opinion.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s bait. Don’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked
this administration on national television. You can’t afford to leave
that hanging.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Did we tape the Duke game?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s waiting on the plane. The ending was
pretty…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Please don’t tell me. Just for once,
surprised.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and
the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place
clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth. We’re linked to a
network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations. We
could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: This is a remarkable aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You don’t know the half of it. Did you
know this entire plane is shielded from radiation? We could fly through
a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: A dubious distinction, no?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I guess it depends on your
perspective.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And all these rooms here?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Conference rooms, though some have other
functions. The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: As you can see, back here’s more like a
regular plane. Security and Secret Service take this cabin. You’ll be in
the rear with the press pool.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Here’s a press kit. I’ll let you guys get
comfortable and once we’re airborne I’ll be able to schedule the
interviews.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: You fellas win some sort of fly-with-
POTUS contest?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Potus? What is Potus?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United
States.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Ah, no. We won nothing. We are ITAR-TASS
news service.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Right. Listen, this here… This is my row.
You’ll have to sit over there.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Welcome aboard, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hey Danny. How’s it look tonight?</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Glassy, sir. Care to take the
wheel?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You keep offering, one of these days I’ll
take you up on it. Rose and Alice back yet?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: No, Mr. President. The ballet ran late. Their
ETA is seventeen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Can I at least issue a press release
objecting to the Speaker’s choice of wording?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I said it’s not worth the fight. Steward,
please.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: We’ll just say it was in bad taste.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: You give me ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Mr. President?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hey Mike. Could you get me a Heineken?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: No, wait. Get him one of the Russian
beers.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: We’ve got those Russian news guys on board
and it’ll look good in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: C’mon Shep. I’ve been eating borscht and
drinking vodka for days. Isn’t that enough? New home starts are
down.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Fill this with Heineken.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Yes, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I don’t believe this. I’m playing politics
with a bottle of beer. A goddamn bottle of beer. I’ve been in office too
long.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Look on the bright side… if the polls
don’t change, you won’t have that problem, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yeah. Put the Duke game on in my room.</p>
<p><strong>air force specialist</strong>: Yes, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Defense and State Department in the
conference room in one hour. I want to review the Iraq situation.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Get me the Housing Secretary…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: C’mon Alice, we’re 20 minutes late.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s not like he hasn’t made us wait a few
times.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Well, you aren’t the President, dear.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah, no duh.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why don’t you go say hi?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What is wrong with you tonight? Come here.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You don’t want to say hi to your father?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m sure he’s busy.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t you even want to ask?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: If I go over there to say hi to daddy
President, Mike’s going to tell me he’s in a meeting and can’t be
disturbed. Then when the plane starts to taxi, he’ll come out and say
"Hey, are you guys back? Did you enjoy the ballet?" But he’ll be on his
way to another meeting and won’t wait for an answer. Then you’ll get
pissed at him and he’ll get pissed at you. It’s like you guys rehearse
or something.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip
cream.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Alice…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Mom, just this once, give it a rest.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re jet-lagged. We’ll talk about this
back…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Back at The Fishbowl?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We’ll talk at home. You know, most girls
aren’t as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would
be the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I know, Mom. It was great… really.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He’s in a meeting. He can’t be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, it’s okay. After all, he is the
President, right?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: When I write my memoirs I think I’ll devote
an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Your father never means to be so…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I know… But lotsa times I feel like it’s me
versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague
breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn’t take a genius to figure
which is more important.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Some kids were teasing you?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s not really the point.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You’re right and I’ll tell you a secret. I
know exactly how you feel.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Big secret. You said the same thing to
Newsweek.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: We’re taxiing. Ready. And… five… four…
three.. two… one… Cue Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oooooh, I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hey, you guys back already?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How was… …the ballet?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It was the experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How `bout a hug for the old man.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mr. President… they’re ready for you in
the conference room.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you’ll tell me all
about it later, right?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: May I speak to you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Can’t it wait?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No, Mr. President. It can’t.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Don’t. I know spin control when I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Rose, I don’t have time for this.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting
like the little dutch boy. Not even you can plug all the world’s leaks.
Don’t you think it’s a sign you’re pushing too hard when your daughter
sees more of you on MTV news than in person.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: She’s a big girl. She understands.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How do you know she understands? You haven’t
spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And when have I had five minutes? When I
wake up in the morning and I’m already three hours behind Schedule. What
do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I’m a family
man?</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. It wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You know what?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I miss you. And I miss her.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: But that’s the point, Jim. We’re right
here.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I wish it were that easy…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’ll make it up to you, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I should trust that promise? Because you know
the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This promise isn’t subject to
Congressional approval.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How did your speech go?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Well, they aren’t burning me in effigy.
That’s always a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here
thinks I’ll be a one termer.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule
your daughter in?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: She is scheduled. Her school play’s
Tuesday night.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The First Lady was making a joke, Shep.
I’ll make some time, Rose. I promise.</p>
<p>****: United States Air Force One, this is tower. It’s an honor to
clear you for immediate take-off on runway three.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Roger, Tower. And thank you for the
hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: In an unusually aggressive speech, the
President characterized the Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose
brutality will no longer be tolerated. Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan,
Stravanavitch’s ouster has sent the country into turmoil. Tens of
thousands of refugees continue to huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival
Stravanavitch loyalists fight among themselves for control. But at least
for the time being, the ethnic cleansing has been stopped.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Our KH-ll’s took this one at 0100
hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized
brigades.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: They’ve gotta be joking.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it’s just
an exercise.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz
back in.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: The northern border’s gotten a bit
hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just
itching to engage.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don’t
need `em creating policy for me.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Hey Walters, you and Johnson come here a
second. Reykjavik just sent the advance team report.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Come on! Quickly.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: The Secret Service believes in being prepared
for any eventuality.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: We have a code red, I repeat,
code red. Shots fired onboard.</p>
<p><strong>lt. ccl. ingrahams</strong>: Warsaw tower this is Air Force

standing by.</p>
<p><strong>ramstein a.b. controller</strong>: Air Force One Heavy,
acknowledged. We are scrambling our fighters.</p>
<p><strong>ramstein a.b. controlllr</strong>: Call Berlin Tower. Not a
plane lands or takes off within two hundred miles! Understood?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: We’re under attack.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Where’s my family?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: We’re handling it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The launch codes! Who’s protecting the
football?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Don’t open the door!</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Down! Everybody down.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. ingrahams</strong>: Warsaw Tower has cleared local
airspace.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Changing course heading to 276 point
five. Dropping to twenty thousand feet.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Ingrahams, make sure that door’s
locked.</p>
<p><strong>lt. col. ingrahams</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Get back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: We have Boy Scout, traveling
forward.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Negative… negative… they’re up here too.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Roger. We’re going to the
chute.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Come on, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Alice!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: Down! Everyone down!</p>
<p><strong>cot. carlton</strong>: Air Force One, this is Squadron
Commander Canton. You are now under escort. All airspace has been
cleared.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: This is Air Force One Heavy. I’m
coming in full throttle. ETA to Ranstein eight minutes. We’ve got a war
here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cot. axelrod</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Get in!</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Get in, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What about my family?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent #</strong>: I have a family, too, sir.
Now get in the fucking pod.</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent #</strong>: Mr. President… MR.
PRESIDENT! You have to do this! The pod, on three. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>secret service agent</strong>: Two… THREE. GO!</p>
<p><strong>cot. axelrod</strong>: Ramstein/Air Force One: Emergency pod
has been deployed. I repeat, emergency pod has been deployed.</p>
<p><strong>ranstein a.b. controller</strong>: This is Ramstein.
Acknowledged. We are picking up the homing beacon and deploying search
and rescue.</p>
<p><strong>cot. axelrod</strong>: Copy Ramstein. We are dropping to five
thousand feet, beginning final approach.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Daddy? Dad?</p>
<p><strong>nevsky</strong>: Your father has left you behind.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Open! Now!</p>
<p><strong>cot. axelrod</strong>: Ramatein, we are fifteen miles away on
final approach. I’m coming in fast and will need every inch of
runway.</p>
<p><strong>cot. axelrod</strong>: Let’s get this crate on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>col. axelrod</strong>: Almost there.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Keep moving!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Throttle up. Throttle up!</p>
<p><strong>ramstein a.b. controller</strong>: Aw Fuck. We’re losing
it!</p>
<p><strong>a c-141 starlifter</strong>: in his path. A monstrous plane,
every bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs eases back on the wheel and the
747 sluggishly responds, its nose creeping upward.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Bearing 110 point eight two.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Call me if something changes.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: To fly a 747 you need to know three things.
How to take of f, how to land, and how to engage the autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: The rest of the secret service?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Dead.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: How many others killed?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Any of us?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: No damages.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Where’s my daughter?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: She’s alive, ma’am, for the time being.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: And my husband?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: The secret service did their job, ma’am. The
President is safely off the plane. But that still leaves us plenty to
bargain with.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people…</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Follow me, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: We should have the President secure
within minutes. Do we know who these terrorists are or where they’re
going?</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: General Greely says it looks like
the Middle East.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Does your office have anything to
add, Mr. Dean?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: The garners believe that, given the scenario,
there’s an 86% chance that</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: If we’re dealing with an airborne
hostage situation what’s our procedure?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Our only policy assumes the plane is on the
ground. Our hands are completely tied while they’re in the air.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Okay, Gentlemen, we’ll take no action
until we confirm that the president is off the plane… Lee, go huddle
with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Twenty minutes?</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: You heard me. You. Congress and
cabinet heads.</p>
<p><strong>air force colonel</strong>: Madame Vice-President?</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>air force colonel</strong>: National Command Authority. All
previous launch codes have been cancelled. You’re carrying the ball
now.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #1</strong>: No sir. I just wish…</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Roger. We all wish… Now shut the fuck
up and escort.</p>
<p><strong>nevsky</strong>: Every weapon and every person is accounted
for.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is
not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What do you want with us?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Cooperation. If you try to escape, you
will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade’s
bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: This can’t be happening. You just don’t
pull this shit with the United States. You just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Keep your heads.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: That’s all that matters. Thank god the
President got of f the plane.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes… thank God. You there… Caidwell, right?
What’s on your mind? caldwell takes a beat, then crosses to Rose and
Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: I don’t want to get anybody here
excited, but if we can get out of this room, I can get us to safety.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: We’re thirty five thousand feet up.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Yes, sir, that’s a problem, but if
we can somehow get to a lower altitude, the rear loading ramp on the
baggage deck is equipped with parachutes in case of an engine failure.
Now we can either wait for a political resolution, or try to resolve
this thing ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: You’re goddamn right we can resolve this
ourselves. We’ll negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: You know the President’s policy.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: The President isn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Right now we are an enormous liability to the
United States. We can’t just sit and do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>viad</strong>: Standing guard, facing the opposite
direction.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Proceed.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: …the Chief of Staff, the First Lady, and
the First Daughter. Our demands are simple. Arrange the release of Ivan
Stravanvitch. Once our leader is returned to Turkuenistan soil, Air
Force One and it’s occupants will be allowed safe passage to
Switzerland. You have one hour before we start killing hostages.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Find that voice for me, I want to
know who we’re dealing with. And get President Petrov on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: Madame Vice-President, we just got
word from Ramstein… The nod was UntiL Chandler stands.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Empty?</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: The President… he must still be
onboard.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Play back that call.</p>
<p><strong>technical officer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: The plane is under our command, and those
we did not kill we hold as hostages, including the Chief of Staff, the
First Lady, and the First Daughter.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: but not the President. Not the
President.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: He’s dead then. They must have
killed him.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Holding the president hostage is
not something that slips your mind when you’re making demands.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: And if he’s dead? Do you really think
they’d risk telling us?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: There is a possibility we’re overlooking.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered the
destruction of a V.C. munitions dump. During insertion, the plane was
shot down and the entire team was killed, or so we thought. Two days
later the dump</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Walter, if you have a point, make
it.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That kid’s name was Jim Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: So what are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Maybe he’s alive on that plane and those
bastards don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the
President is not 19 anymore.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: This is a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>vlad</strong>: Get on the floor, now!</p>
<p><strong>viad</strong>: The President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That’s right, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>nevsky</strong>: Viad?</p>
<p><strong>nevsky</strong>: Vlad? Vlad?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Where are thy? fly tamily, the crew….
where are they?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: o’11 unlocli the door for me or I’ll kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Go after him.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: I know you’re in there. Come on out. Okay.
Have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Serge?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: The NRA’ll love this.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: I understand your dilemma, Vice President
Chandler. But unless you can confirm that your President is indeed a
hostage, I cannot release Stravanavitch. If Marshall is dead, no good
will come of meeting this demand. We both know he would agree.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: .. is not a First Lady if her husband’s been
killed. Then she’s a civilian. And I can’t release him for a civilian.
Do you see my point?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Madame Vice president. We have an options
paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as
she talks.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Yes. You’ve made yourself quite
clear.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: But I will deploy forces to a staging area
near the Turkmenistan border. When you have more information, we can
decide how to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: By then I’ll be President.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: I don’t like any of these. from, did
you brief General Northwood?</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Can we do that?</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: We’ve got four hours before they
make it into Turkienistan airspace.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: But they start executing hostages
in</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: I hate to be pragmatic, but
they’ll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill
their way up to senior staff.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Okay. Also, I want you to put our
bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory
air strike.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: I’ve not discounted your theory
Hr.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: No… I got the new numbers from our gamers.
They believe that there’s only an eight percent chance that the
President is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Eight percent is better than
zero.</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: That’s trouble.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Would someone get the Press
Secretary!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: He’s been holding on line four.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: We checked the manifest. Everyone was
accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: A secret service agent. It must be.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: The conference room is no longer secure.
We’ll take the First Lady and the girl up top where we can keep a closer
eye on them.</p>
<p><strong>major cal dwell</strong>: We’re not getting out that way.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Admirable, but you’re wasting your time.
Mrs. Marshall, would you and your daughter please come here.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Now, or he dies, please.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Come on, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>doherty</strong>: You’ve got the better part of the White
House locked in this room, you know. If you want to negotiate, we’re the
ones to do it with.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It’s okay. Do what you’re told. It’s okay.
We’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Information. How can I assist you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Washington D.C.?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes, sir. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yes, the number for the White House.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I don’t drink coffee.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You must be tired. It’ll wake you up.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: No, thank you. The gunfire did that.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Leave my daughter alone.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I
admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What do you know of my husband?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: I know he left you behind.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My husband is a very courageous man.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Your husband is a coward. He sends
soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the
middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re one of Stravanavitch’s men.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: So, you study world events, little one.
That’s good for a girl your age.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand
Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch’s cleansings…
along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went
to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Smart for your age, eh? Top of your
class? Tell me, do you know what the word "propaganda" means?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah. Do you know what the word "asshole"
means.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Alice!</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Yes, I have heard that word.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Yes, I am an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Your father is a reasonable man.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: White House switchboard. How may I
direct your call.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an
emergency call from Air Force One. Who’s there? Is the Vice- President
there?</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: who can I say is calling?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This is the President.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t cut me off. This is an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: Sir, the President does not call this
particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this
call traced.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You don’t understand. This is an
emergency. Let me talk to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: Okay… if you’re the President, when’s
your wife’s birthday?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Look lady, I don’t have time for games.
Just put the….</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: Thank you for calling the white
House…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No. no. no. Wait. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I should know this.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s June.</p>
<p><strong>switchboard</strong>: Sir? Are you there? Sir? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>baz ylev</strong>: Hands away from your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Come now. You don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: On your knees…</p>
<p><strong>phone</strong>: Hello. Is anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>bazyuv</strong>: What’s that in your shirt? Open it.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Take it off. Now.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: My intention is not to escalate the
situation, but it’s a contigency that must be considered. Hang on…
What?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The switchboard says that someone called in
claiming to be the President, then she heard gunfire.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Could be some crank watching CNN.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: No sir. Trace confirms the call is Coming from
a White House staff cellular account.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Put it through down here. Hang on,
Toni.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: What’s going on in the
background?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Max, get me Willis.</p>
<p><strong>willis</strong>: Tracking… Intercepting call… Got it. Ten
seconds, Mr. Dean.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Hands… hands behind your head, Mr.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: It’s him. He is alive.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: I’m going to take your weapon now, and then
I’m going to take you Upstairs to join the others.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Christ, they have him.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: And if you make any sudden moves, I will
not hesitate to shoot.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Maybe they don’t have him
yet.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: And maybe we aren’t so
helpless.</p>
<p><strong>general nortpnood</strong>: General Greely, Air Force One has
automatic countermeasures, right?</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: Everything we own is in that
plane.</p>
<p><strong>general nortinood</strong>: So a single missile launched from
a distance should be a mere distraction.</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: Theoretically.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Ramutein Tower Control,
please.</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: But the effect could be jarring.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Exactly. Ramstein? General
Northwood… Patch me through to your fighters. Madame Vice President…
with your permission?</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>baz ylev</strong>: So you’re the President. Somehow, I
thought you’d be smaller.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to advise
you, no secret service to protect you, no armies to command.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: You’ll suffer for what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: So will you.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Up. Get up now!</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: You will walk ahead… slowly. Do you
understand? Do you understand!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Do you know what’s going to happen to you
because of this? Do you know what the world will do?</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Nothing. The world will do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sky - night</strong>: 63.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: You want me to what?</p>
<p><strong>general nortpnood</strong>: You heard the order. And do not,
I repeat, do not take your best shot.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Roger, sir. Okay boys, clear the deck.
I have been ordered to engage Air Force One.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Assuming attack posture. Targeting
computer is on.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Target is acquired. I have good
tone</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The flight stick. Carlton’s finger over
the firing button. He hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: They’re gonna court martial me for
this.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Gibbs! Gibbs! Get in here.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: The Americans fired at us.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Why would they fire on us?</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Do something.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: I’m not a combat pilot.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: We’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: why did they do that?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Psychology. They’re trying to unnerve
us.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Well it worked.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Relax, my friend. Apparently they cannot
harm us. Even if they wanted to. rNT. FRONT GALLEY. 67.</p>
<p><strong>bazylev</strong>: The leader of the free world.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes dear?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m sorry I was so mean to you earlier.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I know, sweetie. I know. You’re being very
brave.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: He’s not up here. I’m going down below.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Did they say anything about my family?</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: They’re still alive, but the
loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Then tell me there’s a rescue operation
underway.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: and if that means negotiating…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You know my policy. We don’t negotiate
with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: But this is different, sir. You’re
the President.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Please, Mr. President. You’re going
to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of
thousands killed. I can’t live with that. I’m not royalty. I’m an
elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is
infinitely more important than the man who holds that office. We don’t
negotitate. Not as long as I’m President. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: flow, is there a rescue operation under
way or not?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: He’s not on a secure line.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m here, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Where’s the cavalry?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: We can’t do anything until that plane lands.
And when it does land, sir, it’s going to be in hostile territory. To be
perfectly honest, we don’t know what the hell to do.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: Bazylev is dead.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: Trapped On the baggage deck. Let me go finish
him.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: No. He has the advantage down there.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: You. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What the hell…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Out of fuel.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Come on, where are you…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Ms. Mitchell. Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Maria.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Please tell me</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Maria… Maria Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: I’m responsible for Press Relations for
the Flight Office.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: How are your fellow hostages feeling,
Ms. Mitchell?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Scared. We’re scared.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And why are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Because… because I don’t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And what am I doing at this very
moment.</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: You’re pointing a gun at me.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Now, to the secret service agent in the
baggage deck. I’m giving you ten seconds to surrender, or this women
will die.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: One…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Two…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Three…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Four…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Five…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Six…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Seven…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Eight…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Nine…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Ten…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Aw, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>korsfl3nov</strong>: I’ll give you a few minutes to think
about that one and then we’ll try again. Perhaps soon I will choose
somebody important.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: She was important.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Do you have to be so brutal?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Why? Do you enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: How can you? I mean they’re people.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: But they are not ny people. You look at
me as if I am a monster, but answer me this – when your planes bombed
the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose
names you do not know and who’s faces You will never see? Did You cry
for their wives and children. They were people too, yes… but they were
not your people.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: That was war.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: So is this. Come now, you’re upsetting
the little one.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: The woman you shot. She was my friend.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: That’s the way of the world, little one.
Didn’t they teach you that in school?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Chief Mechanic, 87th Air. How can I help
you?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You can talk me through an emergency fuel
dump.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Led off to slaughter one at a
time.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: They can shoot enough of us.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: If we don’t act, they’ll kill US all
eventually Who’s with me?</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: Do you see the maintenance
panel?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: Pop it open. There should be a red
switch, toggle it up.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Okay, it’s on. We’ve got some indicator
lights here.</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: Okay, you’re aerated. To dump the
fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There’s no switch in
Avionics so you’ll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires,
just to your left. Do you see them?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Got `en.</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: Okay, hang on. Let me double
check</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: First… cut… green wire.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s cut.</p>
<p><strong>chief mechanic</strong>: cross it… The static overwhelms the
voice, then cuts out.</p>
<p><strong>marshalr’</strong>: Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: An emergency landing in friendly
territory… there’s your goddamn miracle.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Goddamnit it. We’re losing fuel.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Avionics compartment! It’s the only place.
You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you’d rather be
a martyr than a savior.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Go! Take Serge.. and watch your
backs.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: He’s down here. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: Shut up and do your job.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: The valve is shut. This guy sure knew what
he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: You see him?</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: Erring on the side of caution.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: I’m going to deactivate the by-pass pump.
It’ll take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: We’ve stopped dumping… but we’ve only got
about twenty minutes of fuel left.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: We’re not going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Not even close. Hell, we can’t even make
Syria or Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Where are we now?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to
Turkey or Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: No! If we land this plane anywhere else,
we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that
flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and… refuels in mid-air.
Call the White House.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s him again.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Gentlemen, forgive me for diverting you
from your little wargames, but I’ve just added another demand to my very
short list. I assure you it’s quite reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: We need fuel, gentlemen. And we need it
right now.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Finally, we can bargain.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: I’m sure we can strike some sort of
arrangement. Land the plane and we’ll trade you hostages for fuel.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: No. The plane lands when I say, or it
will crash. The hostages are released when I say, or they will die.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Tell me what I want to hear or I will
execute a member of the senior staff, and will continue killing one
hostage every minute until we crash or until a refueling plane
arrives.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Shall I begin by executing the
President’s daughter? She’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Say something dear.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Fuck off, you stupid asshole.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: It would be a pity to squander such a
strong personality.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Well? What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: We trained for months. Everything
should’ve gone like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: We have the hostages, we’re getting more
fuel.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: He’s already killed three of us, and we
haven’t even seen him. He’s also shown that he can hurt us. I need to
think. What the hell are you doing up here?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Don’t make the same mistake your friend
did earlier… Show me your hands.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s me goddamnit. Let me go.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mr. President, how the hell did you get on
board?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I never left. Where’s my wife and
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: They took `em out. They’re probably
on the upper deck.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Mr. President, Major Caldwell here has a
plan to get these hostages of f the plane.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I dumped most of the fuel. They’ll land
soon and Delta will take its shot.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: A refueling plane is already on it’s way so
we won’t be landing until we reach Turkmenistan. Your best course of
action is to release me. I will be merciful.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Mr. Caidwell, the ground’s a few miles
away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Gravity.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Of the three dozen airports in Turkmenistan,
only five have sufficient runways for a 747. Of those five, only these
three have shown any activity.</p>
<p><strong>general nortpnood</strong>: But this one here, see this. It’s
a satellite dish and it wasn’t there two weeks ago. Basic communications
uplink, which suggests extensive communicatins ability. I’d say this was
the one.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Are you confident you can take the
facility?</p>
<p><strong>general nortiwood</strong>: It’s night there for a few more
hours. That’s a real plus. But I won’t lie. As far as special ops go,
this one’s a bear, but I think we squeeze it out.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: Let’s get it going.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: The Press Secretary’s about to go on.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: If we can get to a lower altitude,
we can use parachutes, but at this altitude, we’ll pass out from Oxygen
deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We’ve already played our cards, Major.
There’s no turning back.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: We can’t jump from here or at this
speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: They’ve cut communication, and I spent a
good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of
batteries.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: The fax machines.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: The fax machines.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No good. I said they disabled the
communications system.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: No. I thought about this, Mr.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Get `em ready. You… come with me.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two
hundred knots… otherwise it’s suicide.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>press secretary</strong>: Please. Quiet please… First let me…
Please… I have a prepared statement… The White House confirms that the
President’s aircraft, Air Force One, has been hijacked and is currently
controlled by foreign nationals.</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: Is the President onboard?/ What about the
First Family?/ What are their demands?</p>
<p><strong>press secretary</strong>: Please… please… For security
reasons I can not comment on any specifics except to say that the
Vice-President is doing everything within her power to resolve the
situation.</p>
<p><strong>pull back</strong>: T.V. monitor on broadcasting CNN. We’re
in the…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And you are almost out of time.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Here sir.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Where are we sending it?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: White House Situation room.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Someone should give you a raise.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Actually, sir, you could be that
someone.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Still no movement on Stravanavitch.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Nor will there be. My husband does not
negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You will be the first to pay for that
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: These chutes are designed for a safe
slow descent. They’ll deploy off the line automatically as you step from
the plane. You guys’ll have to pull your own rip cords. Wait until
you’re clear from the plane, but not any longer. Once I check you, go
stand behind the yellow line. You’re good. You’re good. You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Mr. president? pwtsHALL The fax went
through. We can only wait.</p>
<p><strong>major cawwell</strong>: Your chute.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’ll not going without my family.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Where’s that goddamn plane? tNT.</p>
<p><strong>kc-135 pilot</strong>: Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We
have been instructed to refuel your plane.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: About goddamn time.</p>
<p><strong>kc-135 pilot</strong>: Please change course to Zero Seven
Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Air Force One, acknowledged. tNT.</p>
<p><strong>kc-135 pilot</strong>: Air Force One, please reduce speed to
250 knots.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. afo flight deck.</strong>: 90.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Roger KC-135 PILOT</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: That’s affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>kc-135 pilot</strong>: Ga get it.</p>
<p><strong>major calowell</strong>: That’s it, eighteen thousand
feet.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Sir, we stay with the President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: That isn’t necessary.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Relax everybody. I used to do this
for a living9 Caidwell pulls a switch on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Depressurizing compartment. This `11
take a moment.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hey, by the way… who won the Duke
game?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Find out for yourself, sir. I’ll have it
waiting at the White House.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Here they come.</p>
<p><strong>col. cmlton</strong>: We got… okay… so far ten chutes
deploying of f the line. Dropping signal flares for search and
rescue.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: She’s bucking. I can’t hold her!</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick down and
Air Force One begins to dive to safety.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Let me save him.</p>
<p><strong>zedeck</strong>: That man, he is the president, no?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Yes. Yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Fuel?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: More than enough to get us home.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: They still have the President, it’s
past their deadline and they haven’t called. What do you think it
means?</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Like any good poker player,
they’re checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to
discard.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: He didn’t leave us.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You are a resilient man, Mr.</p>
<p><strong>korshunqv</strong>: You must forgive the tape, but we were
starting to feel outnumbered…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do
this?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Yes, Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Because it is my duty.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You’re duty to what? The country you
served doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: My loyalty was never to my country.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You don’t think the leaders of the KGB
would allow peristroika to ruin years of infiltration? No, when the
Soviet Union collapsed, we took our sleepers with us.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Now since we’ve had very little luck
getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so
kind.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Over my dead body.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: No. But since I only have a few of your
staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead…
Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: The world is such a dangerous place and
we can’t always protect our children.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter
alone.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: She isn’t a part of this. This is between
you and me.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch’ S
release.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This administration does not negotiate
with terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Pity. Mr. Gibbs.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Perhaps a President does not negotiate,
but does a father? An interesting choice. Your daughter versus your
world vision. The implicit trust of a family against your oath of
office.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Daddy…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Alice… I…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And once the trigger is pulled, she is
gone forever. Then, I wonder, how do you live, knowing you could’ve
saved her?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And could you ever forget the look on her
face as she ceases to exist… Late at night, when you think about her,
will Stravanavitch really matter anymore?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Daddy. Daddy, please…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jim… for godsake!</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Look inside your heart. No one will think
you weak. Five…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Four…</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Jim…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Three…</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Two. .</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: One…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You’ll do it?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Yes, I’ll do it. Just leave my family
alone.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Good. Good.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Bring him the phone…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Someday, you’ll regret my nature.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You don’t like seeing people get hurt.
Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is
weakness. You were a hostage to everyone else were a hostage to</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Sir, the President of the United States wishes
to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Stravanavitch.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Can my husband sit next to me?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t know why you stayed.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Please… don’t start with me.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: There’s something I need to tell you… and God
knows if I’ll ever get another chance.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No matter what happens, you have been and
always will be my hero.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And you have always been my guardian
angel.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I will never regret my life with you.</p>
<p><strong>serge</strong>: It’s confirmed. Stravanavitch is on his way
out. Our men are waiting outside.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You got what you wanted. You going to release
us now?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You’re very valuable. And our nation
needs so many things.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Could I… Could I have some water?</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: The taste of defeat is bitter, no?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: One thing I’ve learned as</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: e Very poetic.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And there’s one thing I’ve learned from
being a sports fan.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: And that is?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It ain’t over, til it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: Mr. President.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Don’t be hasty.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: You love your daughter, Mr.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Sir…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Call Petrov… I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: Petrov.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Halt! Halt!</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s about Stravanvaitch.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: He’s dead, sir. Shot while trying to
escape.</p>
<p><strong>petrov</strong>: So be it. The world will sleep easier.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: They’ve changed their bearing. Air
Force One. Air Force One.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #1</strong>: Sir, this new bearing. We’re
headed for Iraq, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Easy, Major. Easy.</p>
<p><strong>major caldwell</strong>: The President?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You saved his life.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s over, Korshunov. You won. Now let her
go.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: There’s nowhere to go.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: They aren’t answering their
hails.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: How close are they?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: The Iraqi Ambassador won’t take our calls.
We’re trying to get through to their Central Command.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: To tell them what? The great infidel himself
is flying overhead, Go get him? This is a man they burn in effigy
daily.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: If challenged, our fighters are to
state that they are on a rescue mission.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Iraqi’s won’t buy it. Either
they’re already in on this or they’ll think we’re spying.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: If fired upon, tell our fighters that
they are ordered to engage.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Dad, look out.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How you doing, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Been better, Dad… You?</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Air Force one… please respond. Air
Force One, you are entering hostile air space. Air Force one…</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #1</strong>: Halo one, acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #2</strong>: Halo two, acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: Stay where you are.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: There goes your ride.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Let my daughter go or I’ll take you
out!</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: If you put down the gun, I promise not to
drop her on the way down.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Let her go now! Or I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>korshunov</strong>: No you won’t. You’ll compromise… like
always.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Hold on, Alice.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh NY god… oh my god… oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s okay, honey. I got you. I got you.
You’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Gone. They’re all gone.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: The Americans say they are escorting
a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.</p>
<p><strong>cerallos</strong>: Did we warn them off?</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: Yes. They refused to alter course and
the 747 would not answer our hails.</p>
<p><strong>cerallos</strong>: It’s some kind of trick… a preliminary
airstrike in response to our troop movement.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: They are in our airspace. We would be
within our rights.</p>
<p><strong>cerallos</strong>: The world would not look on us kindly if
we shot down a civilian airliner.</p>
<p><strong>iraqi soldier</strong>: The pilot says it is does not have
the markings of a commercial jet.</p>
<p><strong>cerallos</strong>: Warn then again. If they don’t respond…
shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: What is that sound?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: My god. I think that was a MiG.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: A MiG? Where the hell are we?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: They’re flying a protection formation.
Call D.C. Find out what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>mis pilot</strong>: This is your last warning. You are
violating our airspace. Leave immediately.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: I said back off and hold your
fire.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Halo Team, this is group leader.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: This is the real thing boys. Let’s fly
and fry.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: It’s the Chief of Staff calling… from Air
Force One. They’ve retaken control of the aircraft.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: Then tell him to get the fuck out
of Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Iraq, sir. We’re over Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Iraq? Shep, you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: How long’s it been since you flew,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Twenty-five years.</p>
<p><strong>mig pilot</strong>: I have radar lock on the 747.</p>
<p><strong>mig pilot</strong>: It’s evading. Can I take the shot?</p>
<p><strong>mig leader</strong>: Take the shot.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Flying the plane.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You haven’t even driven a car since you took
office.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’m sure it’s like riding a bicycle…
downhill with no brakes and somebody shooting at you.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: We got two on the loose. Someone get
on them.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #2</strong>: Halo Two… I can’t get there in
time.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Bullshit. Do it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We got two coming at us!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the
party.</p>
<p><strong>marsilall</strong>: Can you… can you drop in front of me?
I’ll follow you out.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Hang tough, I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot 11</strong>: I’m tight on one, the other’s
loose.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We’re hit. We’ve got an engine on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>cot. caalton</strong>: Shut it down. Shut it down.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: This is President Marshall. I know you
guys are busy, but we need some help here.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Mr. President, it’s an honor. Now with
your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: You read my mind.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Put your pilot on.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: He’s busy being dead.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Who’s flying the fucking plane?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’m doing what I can.</p>
<p><strong>col. caelton</strong>: Can you, can you change your heading
to Zero Four One point six?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Negative. We’ve lost navagition. I don’t
know where that is.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Oh shit. Hang on. Somebody help me
out. I got one up my ass.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Two and three are heading toward the
Boeing.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Okay. We’re gonna arc a fat one to the
right. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How we doing, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: We still got three MiGs running around
and six more on the way.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We’re at full throttle.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Well get `em off me, goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #1</strong>: I can’t get a lock. Break
right.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Daddy, look. It says…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Not now, pumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #1</strong>: I can’t get good tone.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Take the shot.</p>
<p><strong>fighter pilot #2</strong>: Boss, they got one off.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Nothing!</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Oh shit. It’s got us.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: We got six more bogeys, closing fast
from the south.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Roger that. Kick ass, Navy.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Uh, we got a problem here.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Just stay on my wing, sir. I’ll take
you all the way in.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No. We’re losing fuel and my rudder’s not
responding.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Lemme take a look.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Aw, man. You’re torn up pretty bad out
here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Sluggish… I think it’s jammed too.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: Uh, Tower, we got a problem up
here.</p>
<p><strong>col. carlton</strong>: I’m sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Thanks for your help, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: They’ve got no chutes. They can’t
control the plane, their engines are failing and they’re losing
fuel.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I prefered the terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: That’s game, set, and match.
There’s nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.</p>
<p><strong>v.p. chandler</strong>: The Chief Justice? What on earth
for?</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: To swear you in as President.</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: Where’s your strike team,
General?</p>
<p><strong>general northwood</strong>: On their way back to Turkey.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>general greely</strong>: I just had the craziest idea.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Is it our only option? - Then do it.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: We’re now over the Black Sea, so even if
they could get us chutes we’d drown or die of hypothermia</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: incredible, yet unconfirmed reports, of
White House staff members parachuting from the plane while the President
himself battled these terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Yet now, in a bizarre twist of events, CNN
has learned that Air Force One has been severly crippled and is
virtually unlandable and our sources report that the First Family is
trapped onboard. A daring mid-air rescue operation is said to be
underway.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: How long’s it been?</p>
<p><strong>shepherd</strong>: Twenty five minutes. They should be here
any moment.</p>
