<h1 id="conspiracy-theory">conspiracy-theory</h1>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Luxembourg Towers on 7th.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The sound of love.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s love.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Love? Love’s just a pretty way of saying, ‘I
want to sleep with you’. Love is bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I live on tips, so don’t be offended, but
you’re a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love
lives.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I
don’t even call it love. I call it Geronimo.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Geronimo?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Geronimo. When you’re really in love, you’ll
jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming ‘Geronimo’ the whole
way down.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: But you’ll die. You’ll squash yourself.
What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Aren’t you listening, man? Love gives you
wings.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: She must be some girl.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I love her so bad. She just… wrecks me. I
would die for her.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: She feel the same about you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I never told her.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I, uh, I have some problems.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The guy came right at us!</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: You turned up a one way street!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I was only going one way.</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Drop me off here!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Look, I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>cynic</strong>: Just drop me off.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Love street…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: ‘Blue moon, you saw me standing alone…’</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Water main. Broke all the way over on 40th
Street and Seventh. Subway’s a damn river.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: What’re you thinking, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Water mains usually go in the winter. It’s
August 1st.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Tell you what. Reminds me of life in the
Delta.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Mississippi?</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Mekong, my friend, Mekong.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought
because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Sure. And the two of ’em used my legs for a
wishbone. Nearly snapped me in half.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I gotta go, Flip. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s your choice, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The essential goddess death could chain
bitter men, and crush the ugly moment… like life pounding eggs.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Smart girl.</p>
<p><strong>federal cop</strong>: How’s that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s got a blindfold on.</p>
<p><strong>federal cop</strong>: Do you have an appointment here,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Depends on your definition…</p>
<p><strong>older lawyer</strong>: This is the conference room. We start
9 AM sharp. Usually.</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: Wow. How long till I can talk like
that to Mr. Wilson?</p>
<p><strong>older lawyer</strong>: About a thousand years. That’s Liza
Sutton. You heard of the federal judge? Tom Sutton? Assassinated a few
years ago?</p>
<p><strong>young lawyer</strong>: By that cult leader who’s in prison,
right? Ezekiel Walters. The one who blew up the Citibank Building.</p>
<p><strong>older lawyer</strong>: None of it ever proven. But Sutton did
deny Ezekiel a writ of habeas corpus. Anyhow, Liza is Sutton’s
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m an American and I demand to see Liza
Sutton!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Ah, your psychotic is here.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Not today…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Tell him I’m on vacation. That I won’t be back
for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I don’t know if you’re the best lawyer I’ve
got or a high school sophomore.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Get him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s okay! Let him go!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry, you are a restraining order waiting to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t see the connection.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last
three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Testing some top secret seismic weapon.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Not testing. <u>Using</u>. Nukes are passe.
This is the weapon of the future.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I still don’t see what it has to do with the
President.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do you still ride?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Not for years.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So why do you keep the picture up? You wish
you hadn’t quit?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Well, I – Jerry, the point. Get there. What
does it have to do with the President?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The President’s in Europe. Tomorrow he’ll be
in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Motive?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow
of the aerospace industry. We’re talking billions. Motive enough?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret
Service Agent can throw himself on top of.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You going to warn him?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I can’t promise you anything.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You think I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I think you’re different.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know, to be ‘normal’ and live in the
‘real world,’ to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you
have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>. I can’t lie to me,
Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to
people like you. Can’t you see that’s what they’re counting on? You want
to go out sometime?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I better get going.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You don’t have to burst in here every time,
Jerry. Just call and make an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What was your horse’s name?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Johnny Dancer. You’ve been in my office ten
times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny
Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, don’t water mains usually go in the
winter?</p>
<p><strong>d.p.w. guy</strong>: Summer, winter, all I know it it’s
beaucoup overtime.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I was right. Wasn’t I? <u>I was</u>
<u>right</u>. What was I right about?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Are you guys from NASA?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I was wrong! I was wrong!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Have you ever been in a place from which hope
has gone? All that’s left is patience. Everywhere. Like a fog.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I’m a very patient man.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s great. Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else
knows what you know?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Could you be a little more specific?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Lysergic acid diethylamide… With a little
kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What do I know?…</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Who else knows what you know?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Who else knows what you know?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll tell you…</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: From your lips, to God’s ear.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Don’t kill him! Get him!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m one of you! I’m one of you!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: So, you doing anything tonight?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Working.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Hmm, how about tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Working.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Night after that?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Look, you’re a nice guy, but I’m not really
dating right now.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I’m not that good at ‘no,’ Liza.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Too bad. Because I’m terrible at ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza Sutton! I need to see Liza!</p>
<p><strong>cop# 1</strong>: You don’t leave now, you’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza! This is it. They just tried to kill me!
I don’t know what I know, but it’s big!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Get back!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Easy, Jerry. Easy. There’s blood on your
shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I bit the bastard’s nose off.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You bit someone’s nose off?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes! Don’t let’s get into this thing where I
have to repeat myself!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s a man without a nose you want, you dumb
complicit sons of bitches! You’ve got to listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Put down the gun and I’ll take your statement.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re the boss. Just don’t make me repeat
myself. I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry, you’re bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I didn’t even feel it till a few minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Who are they? I don’t even know who they are.
But it’s on the tip of my tongue.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: One of you call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Ease off of him.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I need the files tonight. Have them sent to my
apartment. I don’t give a rat’s ass what you’re doing! Hello?
Damnit!</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Sucks, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: You should get one of these. Then use a pay
phone. Cell phones can be traced.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m not doing anything illegal.</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Who’s here for Jerry Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s lucky. Bullet passed clean through his
side, didn’t touch anything vital. He lost some blood, but he should be
fine.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: When can I talk to him?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: They’re moving him to the police ward. Maybe
in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>dolly</strong>: You’re lucky. I had a boyfriend get shot in
the stomach. Now he takes a dump through a plastic tube. I guess that’s
life, huh?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s yours. Just go sit someplace else.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s that?!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Something to help you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t want to sleep! I want to be checked
out!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What’s the charge?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You were there, Jerry. Figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: If you could remember who shot you and where
it happened, it might help.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What a day. Wish I could tell you so it made
sense.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Just relax.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Switch the charts.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Switch ’em. Or I’ll be dead by morning. Don’t
want to be dead.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Wouldn’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey… I can’t control it. It’s just, something
that happened.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Love.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Switch ’em.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died
of a heart attack. Go figure.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Are you Miss Sutton?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: They said send you downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: The F.B.I., the C.I.A. You name the initials
and they’re down there.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Any special reason?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: All I know is, they said to send you and the
body to the basement.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: People do have heart attacks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sure. You switched the charts, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s okay. The guy traded bullets with some
old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You expect me to believe what, that someone
came in here last night. Gave that guy… something that stopped his
heart?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You switched the charts; you tell me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want
to see your body.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I won’t be here when you get back, but I’ll
be in touch. And thanks.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Ms. Sutton? Agent Lowry, F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: We’re waiting for jurisdictional problems to
be cleared up. This guy Fletcher’s something else.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: While we walk. D.C. police want him for
assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we’re tracking him on a
string of bank robberies. No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him
for.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Wait –</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Guy’s a C.I.A. shrink. Here to I.D. Fletcher.
They knew each other somehow.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: This isn’t him.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Liza?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I was trying to tell, um, Jerry, I mean
Fletcher, he’s –</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: He’s having a heart attack!</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Where’s that goddamn cop?! Get a crash cart
in here!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No! Get me to the crash cart!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Can I ask you something?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: A dog bit it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You were going to ask about my nose. The poor
animal is slated to be destroyed today.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: And you feel bad for it?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: It was my dog. Let me ask you a question. How
long have you been acquainted with Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: The rest of you go room to room! I want dogs!
I want motion detectors! I want heat sensors!</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Is this guy a psychiatrist or a field
agent?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Put your foot down.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If you knew what really happened to Serpico,
you’d be doing everything you could to help me out.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Put your damn foot down.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: He says a dog bit his nose.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Arf… You gotta help me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I can’t promise you anything.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Which way did he go?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t know. Didn’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: No way we can shut a place this size down
quick enough.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You have a half-naked man chained to a bed
rail. Just cover the exits.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ll come with.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Keep me company.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Did you see that spleen? I never saw a spleen
like that ever.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It was unbespleenable!</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the
President?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You already asked me that. Why do you insist
on making me repeat myself?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: And you have no idea where he lives?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’ve asked me that one three times.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Here’s a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague
Mr. Wilson says Jerry won’t speak to anyone else. That seems oddly
possessive behavior to me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m sorry. What was the question again?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Honestly? I think he has a crush on me.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: A charming term. Now, <u>why him</u>?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Jerry’s visits to your office. Why do you
tolerate them? Why him?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: A year ago I was leaving work late one night.
Two guys tried to mug me. It was horrible. Jerry came out of nowhere. To
my rescue. Then he started coming to see me. Could’ve been a storybook
if he wasn’t crazy. At first I did my beat to avoid him. But there’s
something inside Jerry and… Jerry made me see it. <u>He made me</u>
<u>see him</u>. That make sense?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You went to Harvard?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about
truth?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: The truth shall make you free.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: That’s it. I went to Yale. I hope you won’t
hold that against me.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Only on the football field.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I didn’t know the C.I.A. had
psychiatrists.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: We’re very specialized.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Brain washing, mind control, that sort of
thing?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Re-educating trained killers in the ways of
polite society. Making sure the men who’ve gone over the edge won’t hurt
anyone. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: That’s the book Hinkley had on him when he
shot Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I was just thinking that.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You remember that Arab guy who shot the Rabbi a
few years back? I was one of the arresting officers. He had a copy of
the goddamn thing too. You know that expression, it must be the water.
Well, maybe it’s the book.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Thanks for your input, officer.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Gum, keys and a book. Car… Maybe apartment…
This is an odd one.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Safety deposit box.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: You’re welcome! Spooks. So, you want to
compare notes on this guy.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Geronimo? What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry Fletcher. Apparently, a major desperado.
Subject of a multi-jurisdictional task force manhunt… I don’t buy it. He
might be nuts, but there’s something… good about him.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They’ve been coming all day. Nothing I could
do about it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: How’d you know this was my car?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Lucky guess… Um, I’d feel a lot less naked if
we could get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re naked back there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Figure of speech. Could we go?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What took so long? You were in there all
day.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: That’s how long it takes to turn a hospital
inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Dead or alive, they’ll stick me in there with
Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone,</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Oswald was an assassin. You’re not an
assassin, are you, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If you’re worried about the President, call
and warn him about the Space Shuttle.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Right. Sit up so I can see you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Uh uh, don’t want <u>them</u> to see me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Them who?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Flat, wraparound headlights?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate
tail.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: As opposed to?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: People more serious about their work. You
know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You mean I should speed up and try and lose
them?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: That’s how a man would do it. I’m not a
man.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I noticed.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Agent Lowry.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Wasn’t my idea.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jonas?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: It’s his show for now. Look, you want to get
some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: When I’m ready to compare notes, I’ll let you
know.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Your call. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: See? Wasn’t that a lot easier than squealing
tires and knocking over trash cans?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nothing is easy.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: How long have we known each other, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Six months. Eleven days.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Till today, I haven’t believed a word. Now,
I’m curious. Six months, eleven days. I’m going to give you one more
hour to impress me. Where to?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Sorry, Flip. Got sidetracked.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Saved you last night’s, too.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Flip was a hero in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Sure was. Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat
named Ari Onasis.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just look at it. Ten seconds and you’ll be
scared out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You worked all day for that? Lettuce,
tomatoes, no dressing. That’s what, you’re punishing yourself,
right?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You have the right to ask me certain personal
questions?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Nothing scary there. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm…
Ahh… Ooooo…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: More about life on Mars. From a rock they
<u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we
should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that’s going to
cost?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What is it with you and the space program?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia.
That’s good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the
guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado.
Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.
They’ve accused the E.P.A. of, quote, ‘turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the
future.’</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well that’s the eye right there.
<u>Money</u>. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It’s a
plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime
to pull off.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Do they have a secret handshake?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: So why are they after you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not sure. I think I figured something
out. It must’ve been in my newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What newsletter?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So I’m a little jumpy. Who wouldn’t be?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’re certifiable.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You wouldn’t be sitting here if you didn’t
halfway believe me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Believe you about what?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Will that cover it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know that hour you gave me to impress
you? How much of it is left?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Flesh wound. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I still don’t think we had to park a mile
away.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Is this supposed to protect you from
aliens?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know why the Grateful Dead are always on
tour?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: The whole kit and caboodle of ’em are British
Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>. Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.
Just like James Bond.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Garcia, Jerry Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You want something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Um, coffee. If that’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Coffee’s our friend.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I keep the beans in the fridge. They stay
fresher that way.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Must language produce a thousand knives and
not recall a whisper? I love the delicate shadow of she wanting me to
be.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Forgot the combination… You want some
grapefruit juice?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: If my universe had a hub…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: This would be it?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Equitation.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve been reading up on it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Are these yours?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Here it is. <u>Conspiracy Theory</u> It just
went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed
someone off.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: ‘The Space Shuttle’s Seismic Secret’. ‘The
Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection’. Oliver Stone?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Stone is their spokesman. You think if
someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout
it out from that they’d let him do it? Stone’s a disinformation flunky.
The face that he’s alive says it all.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Can you prove any of this?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an
unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: ‘On July 8, 1979, security forces under
control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all
American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were
forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm
collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of
the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.’</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Pretty scary, huh?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Yeah… how many subscribers do you have?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just five. It’s the economy… You think maybe
one of them is not who they seem?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You got a list?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’re a Holden Caulfield fan.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u>
<u>Rye</u>?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You have ten copies of the book, but you don’t
know who the main character is?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ve never read it. I just – Every time I see
one I buy it. I don’t know why exactly… Wanna hear my favorite part?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: ‘I keep picturing all these little kids in
this big field of rye… And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy
cliff…’</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: ‘If they’re running and they don’t look where
they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.’</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: ‘That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be the
catcher in the rye.’</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It probably fell by itself.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Always rent a spare apartment!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Getting rid of my hub!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t know. It was here when I moved in.</p>
<p><strong>fireman</strong>: Make a hole. Watch your backs.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Was that who I thought it was?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Has this happened to you before?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Never, but I’ve been practicing.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Who are you, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Just a guy trying to put out a fire.</p>
<p><strong>fire captain</strong>: See the aluminum stuff? Firewall. Guy
designed it so he could turn the place into an incinerator. Leaves the
rest of the building untouched.</p>
<p><strong>cia agent</strong>: Dr. Jonas, there’s something else you
should see.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: In one hour I want to know what she eats,
where she sleeps, the name of her gynecologist. <u>Everything</u>.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: See? Home safe and sound.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You gave me an hour; now give me a day.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry, there’s something I have to ask you.
Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer
one question. To my satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It was that painting. The one on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I didn’t mean for you to see it. It’s like
looking in someone’s diary and taking it out of context. Know what I
mean?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It made me feel like you could see inside of
me. And I don’t know how that’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So what’s the question?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: How is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Could I, um, could I look at something?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ll give you 100 bucks if you leave right
now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is this your dad?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: That was him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Please put it down.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How’d he die?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: He was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s why you punish yourself.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Not this again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You run with your back to the picture. Like
you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music,
but mostly you punish yourself.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You watch me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where do you stand? In the alley? Do you sit
in a car? Is it every night? What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Johnny Dancer, right? You don’t ride him
anymore, do you? Not since your dad died.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Fuck you. I know you’re crazy, but fuck
you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do you have a copy of that book I can borrow?
<u>Catcher</u>? I don’t usually go this long without one.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You got your twenty-four hours. Just give me
the next eight off.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Fuck you, too…</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’m gonna take a piss in the alley before it
starts to pour.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: How’s your bladder?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not bad. How’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Lot of folks are looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then you must be the smart one. Hands on the
steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: You’re welcome. Where’s my partner?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I like that. A gun to your head and you ask
about your partner. He’s okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are
you here with honorable intentions?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: I’m not sure what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You should think of me as Liza Sutton’s
guardian angel.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: That’s ironic. Because we’re here to protect
her from you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re here because you figured I might show
up.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: It seemed like a possibility. What about your
intentions? Are they honorable?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by
nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I’ll kill you. Does
that seem honorable?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Well, I don’t know if –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Are you pretending?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She shouldn’t be outside at night. What’s she
doing? I know you can hear me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Been a long day.</p>
<p><strong>tech #1</strong>: Somebody bought one!</p>
<p><strong>tech #2</strong>: Barnes and Noble. McKinley Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>tech #3</strong>: CLEET code 115. Location is 11- 546
McKinley. Barnes and Noble. Keep collateral damage minimum.</p>
<p><strong>cleet #1</strong>: I repeat. Target has entered the
theater.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Oswald tried the same tactic, if I
recall.</p>
<p><strong>cleet #3</strong>: He’s in the third theater.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Bomb! There’s a bomb in here!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I didn’t like his looks. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m turning into Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ve been given a cease and desist on all
matters relating to Jerry Fletcher. We’re not to discuss him with the
press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone. Building police are to arrest him on sight
and we’re to report any attempt he makes to contact you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: This doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: It makes perfect sense. Field work is not
our oeuvre.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t like it. Something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not
to cooperate. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: We don’t know who Jonas is. We don’t know who
it is we’re cooperating with.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’ve had a lot of credentials flashed in my
face, Liza. What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions. We’re
out. Shut off. Terminated. <u>Understood</u>?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: – Understood.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Liza, settle a bet for us.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What do I look like to you? Switzerland?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Any messages?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Nothing so far, Liza.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Can’t see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’d like to speak to Mr. Ketcham.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: This is Mrs. Ketcham.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Hi, Mrs. Ketcham. Your husband subscribes to
our newsletter. I’d like to ask him if he’d like to renew his
subscription.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. ketcham</strong>: My husband’s dead. He was killed two
nights ago in a car accident.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They just came for you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jill, I’m expecting a call from the post
office in St. Louis. Transfer it to me when it comes.</p>
<p><strong>drone #2</strong>: Subject is on the move.</p>
<p><strong>drone #1</strong>: We’re losing her!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Did you see the van back there?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What van?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Never mind. You’d think I was making it
up.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where’d you get your subscribers?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I
log on at the library so I can’t be traced.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Well, I’ve been tracking them down all
morning.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You haven’t been bothering them, have
you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: They’re dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in
the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Jesus… It’s my fault. They drew a black line
over me and now I’m passing it on. I’m passing it to you, too.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’ll be fine. Let’s worry about Henry Finch.
P.O. Box in St. Louis. He’s the last on the list. I haven’t been able to
reach him yet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Maybe you better not try… I worked so hard to
keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Realized what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Henry Finch. That they monitor everything.
That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Elaborate on ‘they,’ okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of
initials. But they’re all part of two warring factions. One: families
that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability.
Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower’s military industrial complex.
They want instability. It’s a trillion dollar a year business. When
there isn’t a hot war, they make a cold one.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Cold War’s over, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create
fear</u>. How much do you think an airport security system goes for?
Then multiply it by every airport in the country.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: And you think Group One is at war with Group
Two.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard
of him?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Sure. One of the richest men in America until
he died a few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: His obituary was in every paper. But not one
of them said he was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Murdered?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Right here in Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming
pool. <u>In Newport</u>.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn’t even
kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn’t in
Newport.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where then?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Right here. In the 7th Street subway
station.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What was he doing down here? A billionaire
waiting for the subway? Why not drown him in a bus? Why drown him at
all? Why not shoot him? Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis? I
mean, come on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I see the big picture and you stumble around
in the details.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: They’re big details, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last
week, this whole place was underwater.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: A water main broke.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They don’t break in the summer! Do you know
what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their
sub-basement was flooded! He didn’t die in a pool. Call the coroner in
Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Okay, I will.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You will?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: If that’s what you want. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know what to say. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I – It’s like, I resolve to call you up 1000
times a day. To ask you if you’ll marry me in some old-fashioned way.
Everything you do is magic.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Those are song lyrics, Jerry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I know that. I’m just – I’m nervous. I
reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they’re song
lyrics. And I know how I feel.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I like you, Jerry. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you
think I’m crazy. I don’t think I am, but…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry, I –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What if I reached a point where you didn’t
think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and
drinking Coca-Cola again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah… Would you, I mean, could you love me
then? If I was normal. Maybe?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Don’t do this to yourself. Jerry. You don’t
love me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’re wrong. Since I met you, I don’t dream
about holes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Holes? I don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.
How it was possible.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Now’s not really the time to get into this
–</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s Geronimo. Love. It lets you see things.
It gives you insight. I’ve loved you since the first time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: And when was that? Was it that night I got
mugged? Or was it before then?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the
first time I saw you? Was it? You’ve been following me around. Do you
see how that could be disconcerting to me? That’s not love, Jerry. It’s
obsession. And it isn’t normal and you can’t expect me to respond to it
and you can’t expect me to feel the same way. Can you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever
you want, but don’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t. I know you wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I thought you – Why – Love ruins everything,
doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry? Come back.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Liza, we got a call from the P.O. in
St. Louis. The mail for Henry Finch is being forwarded. Right here to
Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: The International Fund For Mergers and
Acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>int. international fund for mergers and acquisitions
-</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m here to see Henry Finch.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Is he expecting you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m Ms. Sutton with the Justice Department.
Could you tell Mr. Finch I need to see him at once.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He’ll be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: If you’re as impressed to see me as I am to
see you, you’re very impressed indeed. How’s Jerry feeling this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Fine. What the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Please, sit.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: What I’m about to tell you is partially
documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of
it isn’t. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I’m going to
share – secrets – with you. Repeat any of it and you’ll simply bestow
the title of ‘paranoid’ upon yourself.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Truth’ll set you free. I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the
M.K. ULTRA program. Are you familiar with it?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It was mind control. <u>Manchurian</u>
<u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary
man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Ask what you can do for your country. That
kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not
the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover
as a sort of mental flash card.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: We experimented with hallucinogens. We used
electro- shock to produce a vegetative state. We conducted terminal
experiments in sensory deprivation.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Terminal?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: As in ‘resulting in death.’ We pushed the
envelope until it wasn’t even an envelope anymore.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: If I had any idea what to charge you with or
how to prove it, I’d arrest you right here.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic
really. But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat,
steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?
Besides, now I’m trying to pay my penance.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it
was a religion.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: It was. It was.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry told me he bit your nose.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: And what did I say?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: A dog.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: These things you’re talking about. You did
them to Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Why don’t you continue with your religious
experiences?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: M.K. ULTRA, EX CATCHER, it all ended the
moment John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: It wasn’t us. The science had been sold.
Pandora’s Box opened. My children were taken from me and employed by the
private sector. Jerry was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m still listening.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed –</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Belief is immaterial. What’s important is the
truth… It’s been my job to find Jerry. I’m very much responsible for
him.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: If this was a spy novel, your next words would
be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me
all this?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: So you’ll believe what I tell you next.
Because I need to find Jerry. And I don’t think I can do that without
you.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Do you recognize this?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You do recognize it then?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It was my father’s. Kept it in his wallet. He
was murdered –</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I know the story. A federal judge. He denied
a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Not a man. Ezekiel Walters.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Walters had nothing to do with your father’s
murder.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You sound so sure.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: When they found him, he was holding his
wallet. But he hadn’t been robbed. The only thing missing was this
photo. Where did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: In Jerry’s safety deposit box.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Jerry killed your father, Liza. And he’s been
obsessed with you ever since… It’s not even really his fault. The blame
is mine. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It all makes sense. Oh God. He killed him.
Jerry killed him.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: At least someone’s finally taking me
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>big man</strong>: You call that a clean window?</p>
<p><strong>wilson’s secretary</strong>: Ms. Sutton’s pizza, sir.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I didn’t order… a pizza.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Go to the northeast corner. Call a cab. Bring
the pizza. Then there’s a poem. Roses are red, violets are blue, if the
Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Somebody find out if the Pope’s scheduled to
visit Washington?!</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: If you’re up to it, I’d like to follow him.
See where he goes.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No, hold on. I don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: It’s okay. I’m game.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I want this box rigged with a beacon!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Where to, lady?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Rolling east. Fender number 1301.</p>
<p><strong>operative</strong>: We’re on him. Seventy-five yards
back.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s good. Have some.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How’d they like that thing about the pope? I
made it up. Threw it in there to get ’em going.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Are you okay? I wish I hadn’t told you what I
did. But I can’t help the way I feel. You don’t hold that against me, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: No. That wouldn’t be fair. Where are we going,
Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It would be a lot easier for me to show you
instead of tell you. But first things first.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There’s a car following us. Probably another
one flanking us the next street over.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: And somewhere up top, a chopper.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They think they’re so smart… Actually, they
are.</p>
<p><strong>operative</strong>: He made us!</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: We’ve got him. He’s headed for the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>operative #2</strong>: We’re on him!</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Jonas to ground units. The helicopter has
him. Hang back and let him think he lost you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: We’re going to Queens?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Not today.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: On the bridge. Lower level.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Forget it! I’ll buy you another one!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: After you. It’s okay. I’m the one who left it
here.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where are we going, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What’s in Connecticut?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t mean to be mysterious, but you’ll
know when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Drop down.</p>
<p><strong>spotter</strong>: Something’s wrong. We’re going in.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Ted Bundy. David Berkowitz. Richard
Speck.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How come serial killers have two names, but
lone gunman assassins have three. John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark
<u>David</u> Chapman. Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: John Hinkley. The guy who shot Reagan. He only
had two names.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Reagan didn’t die. If he had died, everybody
would know what Johnny’s middle name was.</p>
<p><strong>wilson’s secretary</strong>: Mr. Wilson’s office. Hello?
Hello?</p>
<p><strong>wilson’s secretary</strong>: Mr. Wilson’s office. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Haven’t you figured it out yet?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: My father’s house.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How do you really know there’s gold in Fort
Knox? Just because they say so? We should go to Tennessee and demand to
see it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You go. Send me a postcard.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You know who was the first President to be
assassinated? George Washington. His doctor bled him to death.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: There’s a fraternity of secrecy. And anyone
trying to expose it is labeled a hopeless paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You could’ve fallen down there.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What’s <u>your</u> middle name, Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What do you mean? Liza?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Did you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is that what they told you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Did you kill my father?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Then why did you have his picture in your safe
deposit box?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Where were you the day he died?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: At a horse show.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s the last time you rode, isn’t it? Do
you think it was your fault? Is that why?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Did you kill my father?!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: No…! But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.
EX-CATCHER. America works. Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen,
and the system still works.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry. Please. You don’t understand. I have to
know. It’s all I think about. Do you have any idea what it’s like not to
know?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Yeah. I know what it’s like.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Then tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Can’t give you the details because I can’t
remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I
was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there.
That’s the first time I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Love at first sight?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know what it was. All I know is I had
a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn’t do
it. If that’s love, it’s not so bad. I found a part of myself that day.
I couldn’t go back.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Back where?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: To Jonas. I didn’t know that at the time.
Didn’t know who he was. But I knew inside, whoever he was, he’d send
someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him
safe.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Someone else might call it stalking. My dad
felt it. He started carrying a gun.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He kept it in the side table in the front
hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas’s guys
visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Why? What do these guys have to do with
Ezekiel Walters?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a
building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don’t you see? Your father wasn’t
trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out.
He didn’t believe the official story.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Because he believed me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: How’d you get the picture?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Your father, he was dying. He was worried
about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his
baby.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I told him I’d keep you safe. I took the
picture and I’ve been watching you ever since. Please don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You got to get out of here. My cell phone’s
on. Back in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They’ll trace it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s okay. You… You thought I was bad.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hands behind your head!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Step away from him, Ms. Sutton!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Is his gun still in the hall table?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Go get it. And when you got it, keep
going.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Step away, Miss Sutton!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Wait a minute –</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Liza, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You’ve embarrassed me, Jerry. You’ve made
certain people take notice of me who shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: We’ve arranged for you to take the blame.
Everyone knows how you’ve been harassing the poor girl.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: <u>Liza</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: You shouldn’t watch, Jerry. It’s a moment
without hope.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You’ve never seen her run.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: The office is closed for the evening. Is
this an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New
York office?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Then this is a goddamn emergency.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lowry.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Agent Lowry, it’s Lynn Matthews at the
Bureau. I hate to disturb you at home, but I have a Liza Sutton on the
phone from the Justice Department. She says it’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Never heard the name… Put her through.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Go ahead, Miss Sutton.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Agent Lowry?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Liza, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello? <u>Hello</u>?</p>
<p><strong>int. international fund for mergers &amp; acquisitions
-</strong>: NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: I told you. They haven’t moved in
yet.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Monkey finger. Shoot Coca-Cola.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Who else knows what you know?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Liza Sutton is dead.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then I can’t be hurt anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I’ll be the judge of that.</p>
<p><strong>cleet</strong>: She got away.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Good God… <u>Find her</u>.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Can I talk to you a second?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Go ahead. We’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I want to believe you, too.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Who’s the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: You think we have time to fool around like
this? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: The Deputy Director.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: What gave me away?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Nothing. I was just making sure. So, who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m going to find Jerry. I’m – <u>Who are
you</u>? One of them?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: I’m, it really doesn’t matter. Think C.I.A.
and exponentiate. I’m a government employee and I’ve been watching Jerry
for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: And Jonas?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: He’s why I watch Jerry. Jerry’s the bait for
Jonas.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: He’s shown himself. Why haven’t you arrested
him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several
of whom may be in place already. We’d like to kill a few birds with one
stone.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where do you think Jerry is?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: No idea. Honest. What are you going to
do?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m going to find him. Because he’d find
me.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Don’t go home. And don’t go to work. Either
one could be bad.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: That you come with me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: I don’t get paid enough for this…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Ger-o-ni-m-o…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hey naw-ne naw-ne. Hey naw-ne naw-ne. Hey
naw-ne naw-ne.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I’m with the Justice Department.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I need to see any new patients you’ve gotten
in the last twelve hours. You can say I threatened to shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Sounds like you got it covered. Come
on.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: In here. White guy in his 30s.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Blue moon… Blue moon…</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: We got some new patients last week. You
want to see them?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Look, I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Blue moon… Blue moon…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry…? <u>Jerry</u>.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Blue moon…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You saw me standing alone …</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Without a song in my heart.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Without a love of my own.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Blue moon…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You knew just what I was there for.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Here. North wing. First floor.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: The north wing’s closed off… This way.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: This is as far as I go.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Get the police down here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Diversion. Need a diversion.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza’s coming. Gotta look sharp.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What’s going on there?! Where’s the water
coming from?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You had to see for yourself, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where’d you think that was going to get
you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Right where we are now.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: So, what do you think? Is something going on
here or what?</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Where’s the guard?</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: The President had left the area only
moments earlier and is currently in Germany. Again, the quake in
Southern Turkey measured seven-point-three on the Richter scale.
Thousands are feared missing or dead…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>cleet #4</strong>: He’s somewhere on the south side of the
wing.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: I know where he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I spent two years here. This used to bring
the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It’s Jacob’s Ladder.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Something’s going on back there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Get in. I’ll pull you up to the fourth
floor.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Get up there and we’ll get it back down here
for me. <u>Now</u>.</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: Jerry, you continually amaze me.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Geronimo.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Geronimo is down.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: It’s up. Love gives you wings. You can fly
away from here.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Too good to be true. Last thing I do. Like
life pounding eggs.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Liza…</p>
<p><strong>jonas</strong>: A patient man can accomplish anything.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Help! Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Don’t die on me, Jerry. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I can’t promise you anything.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You’ve been my best friend for years and I
didn’t even know you were out there.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Top pocket… Go on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Remember when you gave me that? A hundred
dollar bill to get lost? That’s it. My lucky charm.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: They changed Franklin’s portrait.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You think it’s a conspiracy?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Don’t know, but he looks a lot more like
Rosie O’Donnel than Ben Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Fred Mertz. It’s Fred Mertz.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I don’t know why I love you. But I know that
I do.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Now she tells me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Help him. Please.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Wait! Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You got away, Jerry. They’ll never find you
now.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Get a hold of yourself, baby.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Flip. Howard Hughes gave you your legs
back.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: You made your decision yet?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m leaning toward no.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: That’s your option. Ours could be to keep you
locked up for a very long time. In case you didn’t know it, you’re
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Not to mention the fact that everyone thinks
you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: We need you. We need what you know. To bring
these guys down. Believe it or not, we’re on the same side. One thing’s
for sure. You don’t have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’ll do it. On one condition. I want to make
sure she’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.
She –</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: That’s not what I mean. I want to see
her.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Then screw you. I’ll rot.</p>
<p><strong>lowry</strong>: Alright. You can see her. But she can’t see
you.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Flip. You’re the closest thing I got to a
friend around here. Tell me something. You think I’m crazy?</p>
<p><strong>flip</strong>: Shut the hell up.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: J.D., I’m back. If you’ll have me.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>groom</strong>: Can I help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: You got a saddle around here? This is my
horse.</p>
<p><strong>groom</strong>: I’ve never seen you here before.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Could you help me out? Please.</p>
<p><strong>groom</strong>: I think I can find a saddle for that
horse.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I see her car, but – Oh…</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: I must be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>liza</strong>: Geronimo.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: She’s okay. Let’s go.</p>
