<p><strong>helen</strong>: Our society creates these socially and
psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is
terrible. They are hard to catch. They are “the nice guy next door,”
their employers – if they work at all – find them quiet and
uncomplaining. Early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity.
Only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive. What they seek in
their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity. For
these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another
human being. Torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim,
are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their
own psychic pain. And then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling
of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. Like addicts
seeking their drug, Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz,
Dahmer, Bundy – they seek out their next victim.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The cycle is endless until they are caught.
And they are caught by chance – they run a red light, and a body is in
the trunk. A leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is
the smell of death.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: At any time, right now, as you listen, the
FBI estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims.
The serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the
law, but by science. Florida spent eight million dollars to execute Ted
Bundy. It would have been better spent building a forensic penal
facility devoted to research.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Confined for life, without parole, and
subjected to scientific study, these men’s lives might finally, in some
small measure, educate and thereby protect society. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: COP, leaning against outside door smoking,
hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He reacts…</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: COP, not certain what to do about the
ambiguous sounds from inside. Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for a
split second from going in the Ladies’ Room door. Now there is more
SOUND from inside…</p>
<p><strong>helen’s pov</strong>: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.
In a second, his throat is slit. In a gush of blood, he falls, his gun
still in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Andy! Andy!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It is October twelfth, 1994 in the city of
San Francisco, California, U.S.A., the strongest, richest, most stable
and happiest country in the world. That is the sole place of life in the
universe. Under God.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: XANAX BOTTLE. Two pills are shaken out into a
palm, others scattering from the nervous haste…</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: HELEN Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as
she tosses down the pills, gulps water. She regards her haggard
reflection with a certain detachment…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Good God. What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>chessmaster</strong>: ‘It’s almost seven. Make a goddam
move.’</p>
<p><strong>chessmaster</strong>: ‘Lousy move. Not really into this game,
Helen. Let’s drop it. I’ve got a feeling about you. Let’s meet. Like a
date.’</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘I’m a terrible date. I’d mess up your
life.’</p>
<p><strong>chessmaster</strong>: ‘Another romantic dream gone all to
hell.’</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘Maybe it’s better to just dream on; avoid
the disappointments of life. Come on, move.’</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: PHONE Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up
the handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes? You son-of-a-bitch! Son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You filthy… son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>computer</strong>: You Queen is in check. Protect your
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>the target</strong>: it is a silhouette of a man’s head and
torso; centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the shoulder,
is a small red circle. Still SMOKING, THE HOLES FROM THE BULLETS are
scattered all over the chest, and none in the circle.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: My third grade teacher at the convent shot
better than that.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Yeah, but she had divine guidance.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’d feel a whole lot safer with Sister Loretta
for my backup. Look at this guy: you shredded him!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Well, he’s dead, he can’t hurt me now.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: It’s sloppy shooting. It’s in character,
Ruben, but unnecessary. And bad for your career.</p>
<p><strong>ruben lets off three quick shots</strong>: they cluster
nearer the circle. M.J. looks at him in surprise.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’ve been practicing. Now can I kiss your
tummy?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Perp’s holding a hostage, the shoulder on his
gun hand is gonna be exposed.</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: A CELLULAR PHONE . M.J. holds her fire.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Answer it.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’m sure she thinks it is. Aren’t you at
least interested in which one it is?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’m here, where are you?… Heeeeyyy! What a
surprise! No. On duty, have to call you back… You, too, you too. My God,
you made my day.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You hit the brachial nerve…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You’re good enough you’ll never have to kill
anyone. I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I
realize I’ve got a little problem with my stance… could you just move
over here and critique my legs?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: The problem is between your legs. You told
your shrink about that?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I tell my shrink about you, Sergeant. I tell
him you’re the top cop of my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Don’t take that mess in the car.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: He’s in love with you already…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already here.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Hey. And there’s the Haircut right behind. If
she stops short he’s gonna be there feet up her ass…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Inspector, can you…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I just got here myself, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: …confirm this third murder adds up to a
pattern? Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I just got here. Talk to you later…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What the hell does she want to do, scare
everybody to death?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: That’s her job… Jesus, Quinn is here
already.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I been waiting… I have to do everything
myself. Photo, crime tech, the Coroner are already inside. The Landlady
calls it in; tenant is not answering when called, she sticks her head
in, sees the body, uses the deceased’s telephone to call 911. Otherwise
nothing disturbed. It’s all yours, kid. I’ll take care of the Mouth and
the Haircut.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That the Landlady? You wanna talk to her,
Ruben? Who was first on the scene?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m over here? What’s your name, Officer?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Michael Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You touch anything, Mike? Pick up anything?
Use the doorknob? I don’t want to find your prints on anything later and
you tell me you forgot to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No. I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Liver and rigor are telling me about eight
hours. I’m gonna take her out now if it’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m seeing ligature marks on her neck here,
petechial hemorrhages in her eyes. Strangled.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You got it. Same as the other two.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Tell whoever she can’t come to the phone, she’s
all tied up.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s real old material, get a new
writer…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Hello! This is Geena Martinez, how are
you this morning?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What is this about, Ms Martinez?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: I’m conducting a telephone survey to
determine whether you’re satisfied with your insurance on your personal
valuables…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He used something soft, like a stocking or a
bathrobe tie.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Anybody find it?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Cover her up, please.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Mike. Why don’t you tell me what’s bothering
you?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Whatever it is, I’m gonna find out and sooner
is a hell of lot better than later.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, there’s something missing in there.
There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it’s gone
now.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who came in after you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Lieutenant Quinn.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Well, it’s all right, then, Mike. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Get me good faces on the crowd here. Get a
couple of harness bulls to grab anybody who starts to run…</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Don’t tell your Grandmother how to
suck eggs. I only been doing this work since your junior prom,
darling…</p>
<p><strong>stretch and the walls take on exaggerated
perspective;</strong>: SICKENING – VERTIGO! The newspaper seems further
away.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Damn fools!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: … continues to stonewall the public. Now…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You messed with the scene.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: … third Bay Area woman has been strangled,
but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer. Lt.
Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated
crimes, unless new evidence…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You messed with the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain’t
lost. We’re sequestering that evidence. That’s the trap some son of a
bitch is going to fall into…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Am I in charge of this thing? Or not.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I said you were…</p>
<p><strong>nh</strong>: Then I decided what evidence we choose to
sequester.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Okay. What do you want to sequester?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: The stocking around the neck.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You didn’t say serial killer and I didn’t say
serial killer.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: This is the anniversary of the summer of love
and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love. The Mayor and
Chamber of Commerce don’t want TV announcing killers on the loose.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: We’re gonna have a bunch of clapped out old
hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead! Sleeping in the park, smoking
dope and sticking tulips up their ass.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Harvey, I don’t want you in here no more,
making false statements…</p>
<p><strong>confessor</strong>: They are not false. We pay for city
government like this, you don’t even care about the truth?! I killed her
in the bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>confessor</strong>: Because she was dirty, a dirty girl!</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: How? How did you do it, Harvey?</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: With a knife?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Good guess, but not good enough. Get the fuck
outta here…</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: What am I wasting my time with this shit
for?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Because it’s your job, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Not what I meant; why me?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Maybe it’s something you did in this life,
Nikko…</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Got me. That really hurt! You…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal
bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen,
grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: It’s mostly done, they got nobody in common,
the three of them… No mutual friends – the Landlady says nobody was ever
there, she never saw her with anybody.</p>
<p><strong>pachulski</strong>: Yes, ma’am, I know. You can’t talk her
right now… because she’s busy, she’s all tied up. Deep Throat’s
back.</p>
<p><strong>female phone voice</strong>: This is the third one. You’ve
got a serial killer here. When are you going to start warning
people?</p>
<p><strong>pachulski</strong>: Fourteen calls from this broad. And she
ain’t stupid.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Inspector Halloran, Homicide. I’m in charge
here.</p>
<p><strong>pachulski</strong>: Ask her about the moon bike.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m really interested in your ideas. The moon
bike. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What is wrong with you people? The first two,
I thought he might be on a lunar cycle because they were 28 days apart,
but obviously not. This new one is only two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: No, ma’am. This is no joke. And neither is
tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in
trouble are trying to get through for help.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re calling me a crank?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Do you have any evidence to report, ma’am? Do
you know any of the victims…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think this is number three…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s an opinion, not evidence…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen Hudson. Get Ruben back here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where were you? Don’t tell me. It’s just
under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and
fresh…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Would you please get your hands off my face,
Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I got it myself… I couldn’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well! Aren’t we the daring one? What’s morbid
and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her
door? The antenna is gone off her car again. I had no music, all the way
to the market. Let me find a garage for it?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ve told you: I can’t afford to garage
it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk
every week… most of which rots… to garage a fleet of stretch limos.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I had the dream again. And I got another
call. This time he spoke. He said “You and me, you and me.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: A little heavy breathing is what most of us
yearn for. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He whispered, but it was him! I know it was
him!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He can’t phone you unless the warden gets an
okay from you. Did you give him an approval?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Andy? When a three-year-old says there’s a
monster under the bed, you don’t say ‘forget it’. You look under the
bad. I’m three years old. Call the prison.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh God. I’m really crazy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: When was the last time you washed your
hair?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
coiffure?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Monsieur Andy can smell your coiffure. And
guess what else?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and
take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You parked right behind him. The one I
noticed earlier. I didn’t say anything, I thought he’d leave. Just take
a look.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh my God! Help! HE’S READING A</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But earlier, he was staring up here. Please,
Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. You win. ‘Dirty Harry’ coming up.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why
you’re watching the lady upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: None of your fucking business.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Listen, asshole, I’ve got a gun…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I hate this…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Only kidding!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m calling the police!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Investigators Halloran and Goetz. I apologize
for Goetz, he’s a firehouse dog.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m okay. I really kind of enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ring the gong, he goes. Poor impulse
control.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is he out?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If he’s not out, why are they here?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Because of your phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What calls? I haven’t made any calls.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you staying long? Shall I shut the door?
Make your coffee? Make the beds?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You talked to me. Do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You were the one that talked about moonbikes
and called me a crank? Oh God, I am! Make them some coffee. Halloran, is
it? Investigator Goetz? I had a crank call myself– he said… I thought it
might be Daryll Lee Cullum. I thought he might be out of prison.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Daryll Lee Cullum? I don’t think so. If he’s
escaped we’d have the National Guard, cops’d be crawling through sewers.
You’d have a guard on your front door.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I want to tell you it’s a great honor to meet
you and talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You don’t admire me. No police admire me. I
got one of you killed. Why don’t you say right out what you’re here
for?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You called us, Doctor Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, I did. Poor impulse control. The
accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of
the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated. You’ll never
catch him that way.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.
You’re absolutely correct. The politicians don’t want panic headlines
spoiling the Festival of Love.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, let’s thank God you and Inspector Goetz
are on the case, then.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Would you want to work with us on this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, my God, no! I’m a clinical hysteric, with
panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I’m afraid of
everything, real and imaginary. I never leave this apartment now. Nobody
ever comes here. I just wanted to get your attention. I write and I used
to lecture on these crimes, but… I’m not competent.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I think you are. I really admire everything
you’ve done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the
help we can get, especially yours.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit,
you don’t like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don’t give a
fuck. That’s the upside of having a breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Well, it’s a hell of an apartment you got
here. I’m living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to
go to work every day, wading in blood and guts. I guess the books you
wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Will you go. Andy, make them go.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You can’t go out lecturing? Tough shit. Women
are dying. Where can I lay this stuff out?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t want this. What are they?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You called us, Doctor, if you don’t want to
look at them here, how about downtown. I’ll drive you down…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Now look what you did.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You threatened to drive her downtown. She has
agoraphobia.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Fear of what…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Open space. She hasn’t been out of this
apartment in three years. I didn’t used to think it was real…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We’ll get the paramedics…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.
It’s a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her
breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark. We
know, don’t we, Princess? Give her a couple of hours. I know about
this.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tell her we’re sorry we bothered her.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, no. Leave those here. If you really want
her help. I mean if you really do, leave them. Let her see them. I’ll
see they’re safe…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tell her to ask for me…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Snotty neurotic bitch…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Classy madonna.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Sure. She likes you, Rube. She likes the way
you move. She sure as hell isn’t in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You came in there with this attitude…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Order Chinese for us and meet me the library?
Anything but beef.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: … it was your feeling after careful
evaluation that he was a sexual sadist who satisfied at least four out
of ten criteria in the DMS III?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. Without question.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Without question? He only scored 40
percent, four out of ten criteria? Couldn’t another expert say he
flunked the sexual sadist test? What curve are you marking on,
Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The test criteria are only part of what we
look at in evaluating subjects.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: Only part. What else? What did you think
of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her
because Joan of Arc told him to do it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He was lying.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: ‘Lying. He was lying.’ I asked you what
you thought, not what he did.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I thought he was lying.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: You said, first, he was lying. How do you
know that, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Because people who are suffering from aural
hallucinations hear voices in both ears. Daryll Lee told me that Joan of
Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his
left ear.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He took pains to hide his actions because he
knew they were morally wrong. He was not acting on mad impulse. He was
sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: What pattern was that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The same as the first time…</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: The first what? Your Honor, she’s got this
far, I think she should finish. I don’t think this jury should be left
wondering where the rest of her statement would lead.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I agree, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The first two murders.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: What first two murders. We don’t know
about them here, do we?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He told me he had done two others just like
it.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: When he was seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>attorney</strong>: And you believed him when he told you he
had done that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. I believed him.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Yes, I’ll accept a call for a mistrial.
Evidence of that other crime when the defendant was a juvenile is
inadmissible and never should have been heard by this jury…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: There was no sperm.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: The same as the firs two. Definitely a
serial.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: What are you looking at that for? Helen
Hudson. Work the clues.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What clues? I’m going to work Helen
Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Would you step outside, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I’m telling you. Don’t you ever address me
publicly in that tone. You’ll work what and who I tell you to work.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Anybody in this department ever worked a
serial killer case? She’s the expert. I need help.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: How about I put Nikko on it?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s always your privilege, sir.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You ever reflect how this big explosion in
dead women coincides with the flowering of women’s lib?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yessir. I have reflected on that, sir. Which
explains my gushing deference to you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Nikko’s looking better by the minute,
Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, God. I must have looked horrible.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, dear. You’re at your best with a bag in
front of your face.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I want to die.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I wouldn’t. He’ll be back. If you want him.
The cute brutal type with handcuffs. Very sexy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You thought he was cute too, didn’t you?
Admit… admit…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What? What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Reminded me that I used to be attractive.
That men used to want me…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You slut! No sexy young cop for you unless you
shampoo your hair.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: When are you going to call them?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I can’t, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Then, why don’t you just die. I’m going.
They’ll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat
food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the
unread mail, the TV still on. Make up your mind. Live or die. I’ll get
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes? Inspector Halloran, she’s going through
the material now. She’ll call you… No, she’ll be alright, I’ll sleep
over on the couch in case. But now, I told you, singing like a lark.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Working late. You’re a damn fool.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, I know.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: You’re almost ten years older than he is.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: It’s none of my business anymore…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You got that right, Nikko, it’s none of your
business.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: You’re shitting ion your career. You outrank
hi…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Well, you outranked me, Nikko.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Yeah. And you used that. Used me</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Don’t put yourself down like that. I never
used you. I worked my way up like a marine grunt!</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Yeah, you did that too. You earned what you
got; don’t shit on it, that’s all I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: God, you’re cute when you’re mad.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: He’s just mad he let me keep the espresso
machine. We heard from Doctor Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Nada. Lemme make the call.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Honest to God, Ruben!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I like women like that!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tell it to your shrink.</p>
<p><strong>shooting helen’s place, in the park, etc.: a young</strong>:
RED-HEADED WOMAN, wearing shorts and an open-necked shirt, kneels on the
grass, weeding a lush flowerbed. The CAMERA SWISHHPANS TO the back door
of the house as a man comes out balancing a tray with drinks. The woman
gives the man a dazzling smile, removes her gardening glove and takes a
glass. Her husband bends down, gives her a little kiss. She beams.
FREEZE FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: early crime scene photos.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The way he’s posed the bodies… he’s flaunting
his power to do whatever he wants to her. This man… He probably seems
perfectly normal. These murders are organized and planned.</p>
<p><strong>we are now seeing the room: m.j. and ruben, helen at a
table</strong>: IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES. Helen picks out
one picture from the rest…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Except for this one. You put that one in to
test me.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: THE PICTURE. The victim’s body is covered
with bruises. But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is it an ongoing case?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: For months… last October.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.
Somebody who knew her and cared about her.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He felt remorse. He covered her.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The bodies have been carefully arranged…
different positions, but somehow the same. The positions are brutal… yet
quite… artful. It’s like… a signature. He’s proud of his
accomplishments. There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you
always recognize the hand. He wants us to recognize his hand. I’ve seen
this hand before… what are you hiding?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where are the stockings he strangled them
with?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How did you know they were stockings?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God’s
sake – it’s the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used their own
stockings to strangle them. Tied in a bow-knot.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a
plumber or carpenter or handyman; that’s how deSalvo got in the door and
caught them off guard.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: The Boston Strangler, when was that…?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In the sixties. He’s dead – stabbed to death
in prison.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Why imitate a dead serial killer?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If you knew why, you might know where to look
for him. I don’t envy you this; he’s not done – he’s going to do them
faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I’ve done what you
asked me.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Work with me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s good medicine.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: A little homeopathic cure for the
willies.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: None of you know anything about it. Now go.
And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m the only friend you’ve got, darling, and I
don’t intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Get out! All of you!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You said you don’t give a fuck and that’s the
beauty of a breakdown? This doesn’t look like not giving a fuck, you
know that?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Let’s get out of here…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Andy! Please. Don’t you go!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Aw, Jesus. The Mouth gets a load of this and
we got major headlines around the world. deSalvo redux. The matter, you
think they don’t teach Latin in Catholic schools?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Don’t swear at me because we got problems. I’m
just giving you the news. I went to a Catholic school; I’ll tell you
what they teach. On the knuckles they teach.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Who’ve I got to beat up except the messenger?
Does this give us anything to go on?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m checking out anybody who lives like
DeSalvo. Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.
Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile. Cross
check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling. If
they’ve got a German wife. We can keep cops working on this kind of junk
for years, and this guy’s going to hit again, soon.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I know. Get out here.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: So. Do we tell the media and hope for somebody
to come forward with information?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Or for some new nutcase to copycat the
copycat.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: What I love, the big fight, some girl, she
drops the quarter on her boyfriend so the bastard spends the night in
custody, just to teach him a lesson. We’ll get a shitload of those.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Another country heard from. No. We’re keeping
it quiet, don’t give the bastard the attention he’s maybe begging
for.</p>
<p><strong>bathtub. it changes after a tenth of a second
morphing</strong>: THROUGH A COLLAGE OF IMAGES OF TWO WOMEN. A hand
emerges from a breast of the other. Two heads. One, properly on its own
neck, the other emerging from between two legs. Hands, feet, breasts,
hair of two bodies mixed mischievously into one FINAL IMAGE OF A SECOND
WOMAN ALIVE AND SMILING ECSTATICALLY AT THE CAMERA. Both women wear
their hair in long braids.</p>
<p><strong>andy lies with tv on, naked, giving himself a pedicure.
he</strong>: HAS EARPHONES TO MUFFLE THE TV SOUND. From the dark spaces
of the loft there</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: She’s in the office…</p>
<p><strong>in a chair with her back to the screen, rocking back
and</strong>: FORTH, suppressing her fear by sheer will. M.J. and Ruben
enter with Andy… they look at the face on the computer screen… .</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s the face of the next one he’ll
kill.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the
icon with the arrow pointing left? Click on that… twice.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That computer’s wired into</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: He’s hacked into her Internet address. He’s a
hacker.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He can get into my computer any time he
likes! This is exactly the kind of thing I didn’t want to have
happen.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Can you make a copy we can show on our
computers?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s too big a file to copy to a disk.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy
it on tape…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Why would he send this to Helen Hudson…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s a game they like to play. Berkowitz –
“Son of Sam” – hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops. This
one’s probably watching you, laughing at you.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Let me get a little action started here.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m going to put a guard on your door.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: One officer already got killed trying to
protect me. Please, just take it all away. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: He won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s gone. The file’s not here. What did you
do?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I just started it copying to tape, but the
tape never ran. It just did that…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s brilliant. This one is brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We’ll show that to…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Show what? It’s gone. He wrote a self
destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy
it. Then it erased itself. Gone… Do you remember what you saw?</p>
<p><strong>purposefully down the corridor, camera moving with
them…</strong>: For a moment we won’t know who Quinn is talking
about…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: He’s on the phone calling me like an
insurance salesman soliciting my business, for Christ’s sake. I didn’t
tell him the three most over-rated things in life are young pussy,
regular exercise and the</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, maaaaan?!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: What? I talk like a cop, this is the way I
talk. I can’t believe this guy. Saks. He’s a Deputy Assistant Director
of the F.B.I. “Let me help you!”</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We could use a little help.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: With the F.B.I. there’s no such thing as a
little help. They bury you with help. Explain to me about this virus, no
don’t tell me about the virus. Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We saw it. The unknown target is kneeling,
she’s gardening. Red hair, high cheekbones, mid- thirties, height I
don’t know, she’s not overweight, she’s zofting… She’s in front of a
house that looks like…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: … the Marina area, there was earthquake damage
repair on the house it looked like, a little garden. The light was late
afternoon. Say about cocktail hour. He was bringing out drinks,
margaritas by the look. So we got a house facing west, on the east side
of the street. Full sun, so there’s no high trees or buildings,
residential both sides.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker game! Always
have to s-stay until Phil makes a c…comeback. Am I stuttering?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.’s pov</strong>: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN’S body
is propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head fallen onto
a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open and pushed up. Knotted
around her neck is a pink scarf tied in a huge bow under her chin. On
her feet, secured between her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising
the Festival of Love. It is brightly printed with red hearts. It has
been hand-lettered:</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: She just got to sleep. Do you have to tell her
about it now?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tell her about what?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Gaahhd! What a cop! You busted me! The new
one, in the Marina. She has a police radio scanner. It’s always on. She
turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again. She’s obsessed. She
can’t not listen to it, but she can’t listen to it, so she makes me
listen to it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I am not going to look at any more pictures.
They’re like a disease. They get into my head. I can’t get them out.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I don’t look at pictures. I look at the real
thing. I don’t feel infected.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Maybe that’s why you can’t catch him. I know
what she looks like – the red-headed woman in my computer.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I just came from her… here’s what you haven’t
seen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She probably let him in the door without a
thought. Where are their mothers?! Where are the mothers that are
supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to
fight?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Look at the sign. ‘Hell’? In the Festival of
Love? You make any sense in that?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s anybody connected to author- ity. They
write, they even knock on your door. They’re fans. It thrills them to
flirt with getting caught.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Nobody knows you have anything to do with this
case; nothing has been on TV or the news… Why would he want to get in
your computer?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Because I’m his damned pin-up girl! His, all
of them! They know me. They’re in prisons with libraries, they collect
clippings, I’m their worthy opponent. You keep my name out of this.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: My promise.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be
okay?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, God, I forget. Yes. Yes. You go. Poor
thing, you ought to get out.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Look out for her. She’s tougher than you
think.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I know ‘Halloran.’ What’s the rest of it?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: MaryJane. We call her M.J.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: MaryJane. You think that logic and police
procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a
world gone mad and the sickness of the night. I did once. But you know
how he’ll get caught? He’ll have an accident, or some cop will get
lucky. You can’t catch him by being intelligent and working hard. Or the
worst: there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way,
month after month. The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and
in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before
dark. And then, one day, there are no more. What happened? Did he just
stop? Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he
kill himself? Did he die in an auto accident? Or a fight. Or get sick
and die? It’s like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth. And
you never know. But you keep asking yourself – when you read about a new
murder – is he back?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s amazing. A whole new book, thought up
in a minute. Very good. All I know how t do is get up, take a shower,
and go to work. Hope, if he does another I’ll nail the son of bitch, and
they’ll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s going home. He slept over because I was
a little anxious…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I want a guard on you. I’m worried about
leaving you alone.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: We’re through for the night, aren’t we? You
go on. Get some sleep. I’ll stay until we can get a man out here and
maybe catch a cab home.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That would be much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Somewhere down the line we’re doing to find a
connection between him and you. I want you to worry that idea like a
loose tooth.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You ought to get some decent locks on these.
A six-year-old could get in here. Much less a motivated man.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You and MaryJane aren’t lovers.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you always so bold?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: No. I’m shy and I’m selective.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: The problem for me is… you’re in the witness
category. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well. Another time, then. I’ll be all right.
He’s not going to attack me; what I’ m rally afraid of is all in my own
head, Ruben.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: They’ll have a guard here tomorrow. I know
you have the idea, but it’ll make me feel a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: The number for my cellular.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Don’t hesitate. Anytime. Night or day. I mean
that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, God! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Tell me what to do!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m falling! I’m going to fall!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: …falling… FALLING!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’m right here. I won’t let you fall.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t let go… I can’t breathe… I’ll die!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Shhh. It’s okay. Just breathe. I’ll fix
it…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Put your hands over your ears.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The lock…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’ll get a locksmith.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Will you stay? Please? I’m afraid to sleep… I
don’t want…him…in my head…</p>
<p><strong>v.o.</strong>: Peter… Peter…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Put in the Kevin Costner.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why don’t we save it for later? It’s almost
time for Letterman.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You know I don’t like to watch talk shows by
myself. Where’re you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: See, now you’ve annoyed her. You know she
doesn’t like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so
much! Did you feed her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, I fed her. If she says she’s hungry,
she’s lying to you. Again.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: She doesn’t lie! You sure you fed her?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed
her if I didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s what I don’t know. Why would you lie?
That’s the problem… I can’t understand why anyone would lie.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Didn’t I promise I’d come right back?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Up all night with a sick friend.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: You dumb son of a bitch! You don’t even know
how to treat a woman.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Who? M.J.? Hey, Nikko, explain to me why she
gave you the boot…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Is Niccoletti assigned here?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Quinn decided we should form a task force –
they’re all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it… She
wasn’t killed here.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She didn’t fight back, no hair or skin under
her fingernails. I’m not seeing any bruises or contusions…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What about her arms?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Needle marks, fresh, here. look at this…</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Probably so stoned she never knew what got
her. Like Goetz’s sick friend. Right Goetz?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She’s blue as hell. No marks on her neck.
Asphyxiated? not the same – no ligature marks. Outdoors…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Look at her legs.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Spread out like she was sexually assaulted
here.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: After she was dead.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She was dragged up here from the road, you
can see the tracks. She was already dead or unconscious. Let’s get
plaster casts on any – all footprints.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: If this is just the dump site, where did he do
the job? Where did he pick her up?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Doped up kids all over town. Park was full of
them last night. Very easy pickin’. Goetz’s type.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What the hell are you doing? The Mouth and the
Haircut are right down there, thank God they didn’t see that.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Niccoletti, they’re on the wrong side of the
tape, you want to push them back? Now.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on
report.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You’re right. I can’t stand that bastard.
Sorry. This is something new. Not the same guy, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yeah, everything’s different.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Look at him, grandstanding…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s all we need…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Detective Niccoletti?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What’s this about the Boston Strangler,
M.J.?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hey, Susan – I’m sorry, you’re on the wrong
side of the tape. We’re still trying to find any footprints or tire
marks and we don’t want to chew up the ground, okay? I’ll talk to you
later. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Inspector, will you confirm somebody is
copying the Boston Strangler? This is the fourth, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We’re going to review all the evidence
carefully before making any statement…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ruben, put the light on…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Now listen up, Ruben. You never, never, never
mess with somebody inside the case!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Excuse me? Excuse me?! What do you…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You damn well better start working on that
impulse control. A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who’s
practically a piece of evidence?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: It’s against your rules that I try to help a
witness who’s scared shitless? Who’s…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: The woman’s unstable. You could wind up with a
harassment charge. Anything. You’re like some horny little teenager.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Anybody who’s ever watched TV knows about that
corner.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Everybody could see you – unshaved, same
clothes from yesterday, reeking of sex.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Park the car. Call the lab. Get Doc to lean on
the coroner for a really fast prelim on the sperm.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: When you get it, call me.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She loves me.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I know; the kid hit you first. He already
told me.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: He’s not treating her right…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: She left you, Nikko. She’s not your
responsibility. She takes very good care of herself. If she wants to
romance the kid, it ain’t your business. Your business is to snap out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: We were together six years, sir!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Don’t give me six years! You never divorced
Patty, did you? So what’d you expect from M.J.?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: She knows I’m Catholic! She never mentioned
divorce! Not once!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Then you shoulda known she wasn’t buying. She
was just long-term leasing’ you. Ah, Nickie. Except for that rare
twenty-second twitch, there ain’t nothin’ about sex I don’t hate. But of
course, I’m Irish. Plus I got real problems. I’m worried I might have to
put you in over M.J. There’s something going on here, the Commissioner
is targeting her now, I can’t leave a woman in that position. But the
thing is, how can I move you in, if you go on acting like a teenage
asshole?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: I don’t want the job. Don’t do that to her.
She’s worked too damned hard for it.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: What’s going down with the sting in
Chinatown? That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?</p>
<p><strong>house a new task force, with caterer’s table for
temp</strong>: DESKS. Bulletin boards with notices and pictures;
telephone techs are still installing phones, cops are learning
unfamiliar computer menus, etc. M.J. IS EXAMINING HUGE</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Sergeant…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: So what have we got?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: It’s not the same guy. It should be a
self-solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely
different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way
inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom. This
one didn’t have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3
arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a
plastic bag over her head. Sexually assaulted. The others weren’t
molested that way. We’re waiting for the sperm tests…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to
be in this line of work?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You’re damn right I do.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Okay, now what about your sidekick punching
my favorite detective? What the hell is going on? You got no discipline
in your operation.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m sorry it had to come to your attention. I
am dealing with it.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen Hudson…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: What the hell you need her for?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Because I think I’m wrong.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m not seeing anybody.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I know. Do come and meet your guest.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: We’ve got another one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s no surprise.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: But it’s a different m.o.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Then what do you need me for?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: She was killed somewhere else and dumped
outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says “no dumping.” Her legs pulled
apart in a kind of sexual pose. It’s all different but it seems so – the
same. Artificial and posed… Something’s wrong with it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re saying it’s the same man, but he’s
changed his style? That doesn’t happen. These men are robotic; the
murder is like a ritual. The method itself is part of the pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who turned off the Internet computer…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I turned it off. It’s like an open window he
can climb right in…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.
Where’s the on-switch?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Have you got a warrant? Get the hell out o
here! This is the only space I have left in the world! Why can’t you
leave me out of it?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen – the killer directly contacted you. His
interest in you is intense. I’m worried about you. I don’t want to lose
you. I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the
only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap
him. So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody
here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That little Winona Ryder manner… you’re more
convincing as Clint Eastwood.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you
swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall
outside.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: She’s smoking again.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello?… Oh… …yes, she’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ruben.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hello, Ruben… So that’s that…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care
of me last night.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you for
taking care of her last night. Lab report on the new one. At least two
guys penetrated her. There were two kinds of sperm. The poor thing. What
it must have been like.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She was near a sign that said “No Dumping?”
Two kinds of sperm – the lab said one was a secretor and the other was
not?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: There were needle marks. But no drugs in her
blood.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: So far nothing they test for comes up
positive.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s exactly… I could have taken that same
picture, this morning.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s switched from DeSalvo to the Hillside
Strangler. The Strangler was two men, that’s why there are two kinds of
sperm. His idea of a joke, very witty our boy.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That’s not consistent… You said they never
changed their style, they’re robots…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That’s a product
for cleaning with…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I know Windex, for God’s sake, I clean my own
windows…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s what Bianchi and Buono injected into one
of their victims.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Injected Windex! Why would he switch to a new
m.o.?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ah, if you knew that, you’d be half way to
nailing him. Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive. This
guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex. He’s playing a
game with us. Who will he imitate next? Maybe he’s doing all the serial
killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers’ hall of fame.
Just to prove he’s better than all of them. They got caught; he
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: He’ll get caught. If he has a plan that’ll be
what trips him up…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who’s going to catch him? You? And if you do,
there’ll be another one. And one after that.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You’re afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This one, yes. I was always curious about
these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I’ve felt
personally terrified of. He’s something new and unheard of. I don’t know
what he wants.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m giving you Clint outside.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: …to mimic the M.O. of the Boston Strangler.
The police here are rumored to be consulting Dr. Helen Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It was backstage at the McClusky Auditorium
on the Berkeley campus that Dr. Hudson’s police bodyguard was killed.
Daryll Lee Cullum, that…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: … convicted serial killer had escaped police
custody during a court hearing, in a scandal that rocked the police and
forced the resignation of four State Correction officers…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: …Cullum attacked Doctor Hudson in apparent
revenge for her testimony against him. Doctor Hudson did not return our
phone calls, today. Our sources tell us that if police homicide
detectives fail to move faster in their investigation the FBI will be
called…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Halloran.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You betrayed me! Now every psychopath in the
city knows I’m back in business… You lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I did not; the Mouth – that’s what we call
Susan Schiffer – got it on her own.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why should I trust you?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Because I’m all you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How could you…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I like the real smart Helen Hudson a lot, I’m
Goddamned sick and tired of the hysterical little girl, Helen. You asked
your way in – I don’t forget that. You’ve got a nickname around here –
“Deep Throat” from all the phone calls, I wonder if you know that. Go
take a xanax, I’ve got to got to work.</p>

than a .38; it’s a .44 or 9 millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at
everything she can find – gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose change, etc.
She lifts her head and finds the car radio and tape player right in her
face.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Was this on? When you found the car was the
tape player on or off.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: It was on, auto-reverse, over and over.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Yeah?… I can’t talk now… What?… No. There’s
no sexual assault, it’s a drive-by, a woman in a car, it’s not him.
Helen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s a woman shot in a car?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Yes. I have to go…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She on the passenger side?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his
work…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s that music. It’s Abba. I can hear it.
It’s Abba.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: What’s Abba?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Bunch of Swedish women. You’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Don’t hang up!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Listen to me. Is there a gas station
nearby?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Is there a phone booth there?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: They all have one…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Go and look for a note.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She wants me to check the phone booth for a
note.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen… excuse me, we…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: She was listening to Abba in her parked car
when she was shot with a Bulldog .44.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Tony!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Let me see the slug outta the door!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What’s that siren?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: One of those goddamned car alarms. What’s
going…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ruben’s gone to look… It’s banged up but it
looks like a .44. It’s Son of Sam. Is it Son of Sam?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Look in the crowd. He liked to hang around
and watch the cops at work…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: “Police: let me haunt you with these words:
I’ll be back.”</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Hold on a minute, Helen…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen, Ruben’s going to drop by. He’s got some
questions.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Answer me!!…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda Drive. Tell
them to approach code 2 and wait for instruction. Find the goddamn
officer supposed to be on security. Ruben’s on his way. He’ll go in
alone.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: taking the hills fast.</p>
<p><strong>light from hall gives us our first look as ruben tears

with a knife-scarred face.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I can explain!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: The fuck you can! Helen! Are you okay?
HELEN!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Did this animal touch you?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Turn on a light and call in the unit.
NOW!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: No gun!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Bullshit’s gonna get your balls stomped on!
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Chow. Conrad Chow.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Swear to God! Conrad Chow. Never carry a
gun.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Backup’s here…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Then you get your ass outta here, I don’t
wanta see you again…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I brought a present for the lady, there. I’m
looking for her, to give her the present…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You break into her apartment to deliver a
gift? Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: The door was open, swear to God, I’m just
looking for her when you come charging up the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m trying to tell you. It’s on the lady’s
pillow…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he
wanted the lady to have it. They won’t let him send it to her, so I’m
getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her
pillow. It has all about how he tried to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: He told you she was loaded, any- thing you
could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket
to Quentin, breaking and entering.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: The door was already open…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: We know… Send the book to evidence…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: She’s supposed to have it.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: She don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Helen? Open the door. The guy’s nothing. A
burglar.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Open the door. Please.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why don’t you shoot off the lock?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He was in my apartment!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I know, baby. I know.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: It’s okay… you’re safe with me!</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: When I was a little kid, and I’d be in a
state, my father would hold me on his lap, until all the fight would go
out of me…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You think you’re my Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Helen…honey, you know I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You know how to use this?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They taught me at the FBI. I was very good at
it. It scared me… I liked it.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: You take it, hang on to it, it’ll make you
feel safer. Stay put.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>the song is just ending, on a cd player in the room.
a</strong>: projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
phone booth.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Hello. I am Meryhew Saks. The song is called
“Murder By Numbers.” The performers are a group called The Police. Adam
here… working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph
in the note. This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of
fancy theories floating around. We’re not ruling out the possib- ility
of three Copycat serial killers. We have Quantico working on graphology,
the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It’s our feeling
that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the
victims. We have a team sweeping sperm banks. Now I want to say a few
word to you local people. Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.
The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local
police. We couldn’t catch up on what you people know if we had a year.
We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic
science; you have the local savvy. Together we can be unbeatable. Which
one is Inspector Halloran?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>two shot</strong>: Saks is unctuous and insincere,
self-confident.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: We don’t see too many lady homicide
detectives. You have my respect. Have you discussed the note with
Dr. Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Someone broke into her place last night. It
wasn’t connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I
haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: I was just about to advise the Inspector here
not to show Dr. Hudson the note.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern
develop…</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: We know Helen. She’s not exactly a credible
collaborator. Especially late in the day…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: She takes tranquilizers her doctor
prescribes.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Who prescribes the brandy?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How come you’re so up on Dr. Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: She is a writer, writing best selling books
about serial killing. Giving lectures she’s well-paid for. Her interests
are not the interests of law enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: We’ve put a tap on Dr. Hudson’s phone. I know
you won’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Sorry to interrupt. I need a word with my
officer…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: M.J., I’m going to have to borrow Ruben. The
alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and
Jack’s kid got hit by a car. I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What does this mean? Now we got the FBI, my
team is expendable? I’m working my ass off, is anybody listening? Why
Ruben, anyway? He and Nikko don’t even get on together…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation
and self-discipline.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: If this is a first step in kicking me off the
case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don’t waste time being
diplomatic.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Just, I need results. And – I am
short-handed. Who else am I gonna give him?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Give him thatpompous son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Lab called. They got a result on the drug test
you requested…?</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: They said it was Windex?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: …“I’ll be back…”</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Yeah. Addressed to you. “Don’t lose your
head.”</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They put Merry Saks on it?!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: He said to send you his regards and to tell
you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What I can’t believe is that in an earlier
life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give
women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute
here. The letter is addressed to me… You don’t feel fear, do you? You’re
young. You feel like you’ll live forever. How wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I put my ass on the line, giving you that.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They weren’t going to show it to me?! The
arrogance! It’s my life!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: It’s also the major piece of evidence, and it
makes you a key part of his plan. You can’t run away from it anymore.
Look at the order he’s doing them… He did three as the Boston Strangler
just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work. Then he did one
like the Hillside Strang- ler. And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on
– to where and what end? And he’s doing more than that – he’s imitating
each killer’s method as closely as he can – in details. Injecting
Windex. Using .44. Playing Abba.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s not chronological: Son of Sam was before
Hillside.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: It’s clear he thinks he knows me. He lives a
fantasy. ‘Helen, don’t lose your head.’ Is that a threat? Does he want
to cut off my head? Dahmer cut off heads. Who else? Kemper. Did Gacy?
Rivkind? I think Rivkind did.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He attacks what he feels he can’t have. What
he feels excluded from…</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
studying together, picnicking. Women sunbathe, their straps pulled down
on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to expose their midriffs.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘First you make a stone of your heart.’… Oh
yes! He doesn’t suffer. That’s past. Now it’s our turn.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kemper said in order to have the experience
he wanted with them, he needed to evict them from their bodies. By
making the body a completely passive object, he releases himself from
passivity.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But the relief he feels is only temporary.
‘…Before your conscience bothers you much less…’ But the tension always
comes back. ‘You can join the ranks of the illustrious…’ He wants to be
like them. The best. To become the best. But, he has his own desires,
his own compulsions apart from theirs.’ His own horrors…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Some horrors that are all his own…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He needs to prove they don’t control him,
that he’s the one in control. But the feeling of power never lasts. He
can control his victims, but he can’t control anything else… his place
in the world. He want s to be recognized. He puts messages in my
computer; he sends me a letter…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course he wants to do a threesome! Only
Bundy did three in one day. Is Bundy next? But Bundy should be last… the
grand finale. What about Kemper and Ramirez? Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?
Rivkind? Who else is on his list? In what order?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: ‘…great dark hall of fame… all our greatest
killers…’ His greatest heroes? He wants to be famous. When they’re
caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of
immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women
and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month. They’re like film
stars.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: They get fan letters…</p>
<p><strong>felix</strong>: We keep records of any threatening or illegal
correspondence, like relatives of victims who might want to send the
condemned man some strychnine cookies. So it’s only a partial list, but
you’re still looking at about forty pages…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Would you fax those pages to me?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Thank you for your help, Warden Hillyer. As
soon as you can.</p>
<p><strong>gigi</strong>: Hot off the fax. Mr. Rivkind’s fans.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If we keep going and work till midnight…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sorry, Luv. I’ve got a date.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ve got a date right here, Andy. This has
got to…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s almost six. And guess what? Hall likes me
bathed and shaved.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Stop acting like a silly little fag!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My life to live, darling, try to remember what
it was like way, way back when you were young and sexy and alive.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You bastard!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But alive!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The dirty bastard! More games!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s not a real name: it’s the name of a mass
murderer in Germany in the 1930s. They called him the Monster of
Dusseldorf.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let’s speed up the game plan… call all the
living serials to ask if they’ve had contact with a Peter Kurten. We
could use some help on the phones…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: They’re not talking to me. Saks looks right
through me. I ask him for some bodies, for the phones – he’s so
encouraging: “you make that your little job.” Condescending bastard.
Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin. Daryll Lee Cullum?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You do that one, I don’t want it…</p>
<p><strong>mitchell</strong>: Sergeant Halloran is it? I’ve got a list
of Daryll Lee’s correspondents. There is a Peter Kurten among them.
Daryll Lee claims he has information about Kurten, but he’ll only talk
to Dr. Hudson personally. Nobody else. The creep’s been studying his
amendments. My guess is he doesn’t have zip. Just angling for a chance
to ask if her bra size is still the same. We get this shit all the time,
but it’s her call.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Thanks, Warden. She’ll talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Do those things really help?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Not a damn bit…</p>
<p><strong>phone rings. m.j. picks it up, listens, hands it to
helen…</strong>: Gestures encouragement; fist in victory gesture…</p>
<p><strong>daryll lee</strong>: Hey, Doc! How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hello, Daryll Lee.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: You read my book which as you know, hit the
stands a couple of weeks ago. You read it yet.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What book?</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: I sent it by private courier, he didn’t give
it to you? That son of a gun…!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’ll look for it, Daryll Lee.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Bet you never figured I’d follow in your
footsteps. It’s real well- written. You should read it – you’re in
it.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I will. I’ll call you, Daryll, and talk to
you about it after I’ve read it. Right now I have a question… Peter
Kurten.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Kurten! Is he bothering you? I told that son
I’d send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ah ha. What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Something personal. Is he bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know. I’d like to know where he
is.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Listen, you want my advice? Steer clear.
He’s writing me he’s gonna finish ‘my unfinished symphony.’ He’s gonna
give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he’s in a position to see that
I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. I’m offended. Right away
I smell freak. Writin’ about him and me and you bein’ joined and he’s
gonna finish my symphony? I didn’t care for his drift. I sent some
liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his
ways. You hear I found Jesus? And what’s funny is, now I don’t mind
bein’ inside. If I was out, even Born Again, I’d probably get restless
again. It’s maybe better I stay here, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I think whatever is best for you, Daryll. And
maybe you’re right, that’s the place.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: You come and visit.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where did you send the message to Peter
Kurten?</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Damn! I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!
I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for
getting my book to you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where
is he?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: In jail.</p>
<p><strong>daryll</strong>: That Klutz. They send him back here, I’ll
kick his ass good.</p>
<p><strong>daryll lee</strong>: Helen, how is life, you okay? Come see
me, talk to me. I think about you, worry about you all the time. I am so
glad Jesus didn’t let me kill you. You know – you’re blessed by Jesus.
That’s why you need to come talk to me, because Jesus kept you alive for
a reason, and I was his sacred instrument… In the moment Satan was in my
heart raising my hand to kill you, Jesus took my hand to spare you. I am
both death and life to you…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I brought back a gin-seng popper for you.
Guaranteed all-night orgasms.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Save it for Helen.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a goddamn minute…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: The woman was in shock. She was totally out
on ranks. I stayed because I didn’t want her to wake up alone in a place
where she’d just been under attack. Stop that, you son of a bitch! The
place wasn’t secure. I was doing my goddamn job! And, for the second
time, I slept in her living room.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Don’t try to lie, Ruben. You don’t have the
face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson’s
place…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Talk to Nikko…!</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: You speak English? You need an
interpreter?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I didn’t want the Illigals, I wanted just the
bastards dumping them in the harbor. What’s keeping those bums at
Immigration? Nightmare in here…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I gotta have Ruben, and a…</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Outta your mind? Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Lieutenant…?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: The prowler in Hudson’s apartment turns out to
have a meeting with a suspect…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You got a suspect…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: How’d you get in on the deal?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter
at Hudson’s…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: You have no authority to make a deal like
that. That’ s for the</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Or the F.B.I.?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Saks. If he knew you did that! They’re all
asking me, ‘what is she doing,’ as it is.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Give me Ruben back…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Nikko?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: We get through this shit, let ’em all go.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’ll talk to Conrad myself. I’ll be in the
jail when you wind this up…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I gotta get something to eat, I haven’t eaten
all day.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Here… I’m finished…</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: I’m going to the coffee machine. Hold the
fort.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: The KID’S FREE HAND rifling through the
drawer behind his back, finding the gun. PULL BACK to show the KID. He
is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed against the desk.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Inspector Halloran. Homicide. You were
supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I was? How you spell that?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Cut the crap. You got a sheet the length of my
arm…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I never hurt nobody…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Shut up – I’m talking. You got felony breaking
and entering, burglary, felonious…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I never carried a gun!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You don’t listen very good. This break in – I
can call it a felony – three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes
already, and you’re in jail for the rest of your life, no parole. Or I
could see it gets forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You get me out first.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Doesn’t work that way. You had your chance,
now fuck yourself…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Tell me what you want me to say.
Anything.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You were going to make a delivery to Peter
Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum. I want Kurten’s phone number.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t have it…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Wait… wait… I already called him, I threw it
away.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You already made the delivery?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, that’s still in my jacket I was wearing.
We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o’clock
Friday. He’s gonna hand me 500 bucks.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What Friday?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What day is this? In jail you lose track.
This week. Friday.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Don’t forget me, please. I told you what you
wanted – don’t forget me.</p>
<p><strong>ruben</strong>: Behave. You refuse my hospitality, I’m
putting you to bed.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Take it easy, Kid. Nobody’s gonna do
anything. Just let the gun down, so it don’t go off…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nobody comes through the door…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hey, you…</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I’m a juvenile! I’m a juvenile!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Gigi! Dock 47. I need a couple units to drag
the area…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Quinn will be here any minute. What are you
going to say?</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Christ. I didn’t lock the fucking drawer! You
spend twenty years thinking some perp’s gonna whack you… you’ll crash
your car… but what happens is, you fuck yourself… You can’t imagine how
many times I saw you two… your head together, I wish him dead. Every
time… Want to hear something weird? I feel like I’d give my life to
bring him back.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You’re in terrible trouble, Nikko.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Who gives a fuck? In all the years I never
seen you cry. You loved him.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Who gives a fuck?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Nikko. My office? M.J., I wanna see you
later.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: He’s on temp leave with pay. I talked the
Commissioner out of no pay.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You want mine, too? You take his, you take
mine. I’m the one fucked it up…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: So I’m maybe gonna lose three good cops? You
fucked up on this occasion, but don’t be so hard on yourself. There’s
something I want you to think about. The book says if you use your gun,
use it to kill, that’s what it’s meant to do. You tried to pick this
punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive. To what end? You’re not
willing to kill, you can’t be a cop. Go get drunk. I am.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If yo dialed carefully you’ve reached your
dream number. Now, you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>helen’s own voice is heard. echoing through the loft
space</strong>: FROM THE OFFICE. “YMCA” HEARD IN B.G. Helen leaps out of
bed and runs down the hall, as:</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: … their compulsion is less about sex than it
is about control. Power. Action. Release from passivity. Albert DeSalvo,
Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer… Dahmer killed his first victim
because the boy just wanted to go home. Bundy said he wanted to master
life. And death…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Peter Kurten!</p>
<p><strong>nightclub. over his shoulder we can see: andy and
hal</strong>: DANCING. Andy is wearing a bright and distinctive
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You were right! He knew me! He went to my
lectures. He recorded them! Listen to this…</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: …Action. Release from passivity.
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono, Berkowitz, Dahmer… Dahmer killed his
first victim because the boy just wanted to go home. Bundy said he
wanted to master life. And death…</p>
<p><strong>and the music from the nightclub blaring in the
b.g.</strong>: Helen has turned and now sees M.J.’s condition. SHE
STOPS</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What happened to you?!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Ruben’s dead. So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy
kid and a buncha dumb mistakes… I’m sorry… because you and he…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I just thought it was so – unprofessional. Of
you both!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He felt sorry for me. It was so nice to
flirt. He was a darling man.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: A man? I thought he was a boy. This last
Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years… you
know why? It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love. Son
of a bitch married men! Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets
crowded and noisy?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re exhausted. Let me get you a
brandy.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Where’s the john? Let me clean up this mess,
and get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who’s the married man?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What does it matter? This guy, you checked
your course records, who signed up?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The University computer is down for
maintenance, but I’ve been going through my own notes…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Look. There’s the order: you wrote it:
DeSalvo, Bianchi &amp; Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer. It’s going to be
Dahmer next. Which means he’ll kill a man.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. Dahmer! And after that…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Bundy. That’s the last one in your speech…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Maybe you should…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’m working on it! It’s what I do.
Quinn…Halloran. I’ll wait. Where’s Andy, can we get some coffee in
here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Out. Where does he go? Nowhere. What does he
do? Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>a bright lovely day, people dining and drinking in the
sun,</strong>: on a deck that faces the Bay and San Francisco’s towers
beyond. Young people, drinks in hand, dressed to go to a summer wedding,
mingle and laugh and chatter. A young woman stands leaning back against
the wooden rail, her back to the Baby. A young man faces her, talking,
laughing. HE LEANS</p>
<p><strong>reverse, close</strong>: YOUNG MAN – His face registering
horror at what he sees: he stops speaking, and the GIRL turns to look
down to see what is it he’s looking at, and begins to</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I am not going to talk about it. How do you
know it was Andy if the head was gone? Where is the head? Are you
looking for it? Oh, God, why him? Because of me. I can’t talk about it.
I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in
libraries. This is the first person close to me who’s ever died. And
it’s because of me. This monster killed him because I loved him.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’ve got to go. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: How many do you need to sleep. Really
sheep?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: W-We had a fight. I called him… called him a
name…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Christ, Helen. The first time, we’re ahead of
the son of a bitch! I can’t leave you like this – and there’s no time.
Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Right. Well. He’s going to do Bundy. Bundy
faked injuries, wore a plaster cast, or walked on crutches, and asked
college girls for help – carrying his books, pushing his car…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Like the others – he’ll pick the most
extravagant murder – Bundy’s three murders in one night at a…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: …Chi Omega sorority house. Find out how many
Chi Omegas there are on college campuses this area.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: How far out?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Hundred mile radius.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: What are the FBI doing?</p>
<p><strong>detective 2</strong>: They were combing Fertility
clinics.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You want to get onto the DMV, we want records
on all gold or yellow colored VW bugs, any year. I want an in-person
check on every registered owner. If it’s rental – check rental first –
get names and location of who is driving one now.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Alert Campus Security on college campuses, all
of them. They should warn all female students with long straight dark
hair parted exactly in the middle – I’m serious! – to avoid any strange
male contacts and report any man with an apparent handicap who tries to
get them to carry groceries or books, or push his car…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: That was Bundy. He killed forty of them,
identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls. …this
is hopeless. Let’s try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on
college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: “Spokesperson.”</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: What about auto body and paint shops; any
recent VW bug repainted to gold or yellow?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You or us gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>tv</strong>: Welcome to weekend gridlock on the Freeways!
Everybody heading for the mountains and or the sea, “by the sea, by the
sea, by the beautiful sea,” and my-oh-my what a mess! On 101 south of
Burlington, we have a big rig over the side, blocking the on-ramp…”</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Any student name registered in Crime-Psych
137 matched to titles of term papers with any mention of ‘Peter
Kurten.’</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Peter Foley. Good God. You poor sad little
bore. I failed you, is this what…?</p>
<p><strong>sound</strong>: HER FRONT DOOR OPENS. She starts, turns. Feet
moving toward her, but quietly, cautiously. As the footsteps turn into
the hall. She stands, reaching for anything to defend herself with: a
paperknife. She moves to the door, raising the knife… footsteps closer…
A man turns into the office, and she launches herself, only stopping the
stab of the knife at the last split second…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Stop screaming!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: For God’s sake, stop – my head! I have the
Iraqi mother of all hang- overs. Very quiet in the hospital zone,
please.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where have you been? What happened to your
wallet?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hal has it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: …then he gave me a popper and I started to
feel really wild… all over the dance floor. Then suddenly I was just s o
stoned. And sick? I had to race for the john… horribly sick. Over and
over and over. I was in there a very long time. And when I came out they
were gone. So was my jacket which I’d tossed to Hal when I was dancing.
Hal was my… Could I have a glass of water?</p>
<p><strong>fbi</strong>: Mister Saks. We gotta Peter Foley, medical
technician in a fertility clinic in Oakland. We got a home address in
Daly City.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Got him!</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I called our SWAT Commander… He’s ours now…
You come watch our boys in action…</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Well, thank you, too.</p>
<p><strong>swat team surrounding the house, with great quiet and
effort</strong>: TO CONCEAL THE OPERATION. QUINN in command over a SWAT
COMMANDER – JENSEN. There are ambulances, a fire truck, search lights.
SWAT TEAM, AND FBI all wear bulky flack jackets, with yellow ID
stencilled on the back. Quinn sees M.J., huddled in her old oversize
jacket, gestures M.J. should have a flack jacket like theirs. She taps
her chest, where she has a bullet-proof vest under her shirt.</p>
<p><strong>swat comm</strong>: Peter Foley, we are the police. Will you
please come to your front door, and come out with your hands above your
head…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I am here with Lieutenant Quinn of the
Homicide Division and Saks of the FBI. Can you tell us what happened
here, tonight?</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Susan, the San Francisco Police Department,
assisted by the FBI, developed evidence that the serial killer, referred
to as the Copycat killer was an individual who resided at this address.
Upon being asked to step out of the house to be interviewed, the suspect
set fire to the house possibly to destroy evidence of his wife’s murder.
We found her dead of gunshot wounds in an upstairs bedroom. He himself
died in the fire. No, we’ll wait until we’ve located any relatives who
should be notified. Witnesses saw the individual burn to death, they
were unable to reach him in time to save him. We’re glad, as the entire
city must be glad, this reign of terror is ended. No, no more at this
time. Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: I heard. Good police work.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Just horseshit luck.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: Don’t ever forget how good you are.</p>
<p><strong>nikko</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nj</strong>: Halloran.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen. I saw him die. I saw him burning on the
basement stairs, he never reached the top.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: They never kill themselves. How do you know
it was him. You never met him. You never even saw a photograph…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Helen – let go. You’ve got to let go.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He hasn’t done Bundy. He’s done every one of
the others, hasn’t he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls
tomorrow, how will you feel? Go there. See if there could be any way for
him to escape.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.
I’m going home. I’m going to try to get drunk.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If there’s a one percent possibil- ity, can
you live with yourself when he kills again?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, shut up, and don’t be so damn self
righteous.</p>
<p><strong>radio news</strong>: …You’re on the air, who’s this…Ron,
that’s not my right name… that’s okay, Ron. What are you afraid of?… I
don’t want anybody to know my name, because I’m a friend of Peter Foley?
I know him from the gay community? He was cruising the night…</p>
<p><strong>radio news</strong>: …that I resent the tone of the Police
and their attitude? That this is just some weird queer event, just
because they couldn’t stop this guy until he did himself, if you even
believe that…</p>
<p><strong>a coed. he has a load of books she takes from him; she

going?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No, you don’t spill all over somebody and just
walk away, you damn well pay the cleaning bill…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Police business – take your heads off.</p>

<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hi. It’s your worst student, Peter Foley –
how do you grade me now, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Who was the man in the basement?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You like that action? Didn’t that cop on TV
look solemn? The guy in the basement doesn’t matter, anyway, just
another lonely heart.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Where are you, Peter?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next,
so you sent your partner…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What was that? What am I hearing? The sound
of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s Daryll Lee Cullum, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mm-hmm. I can’t get to you. You have to come
to me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You know I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I think you will.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Call the police! Now! Call Qui…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: For God’s sake Peter, leave her out of it.
You don’t want her, you want me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I need her; she’s a cop. I have to kill a
cop, and then…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’ve been perfect. Don’t spoil the symmetry
– you have to have a male cop.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t care – she’s a cop. That’s the
important thing. Cop-ness, not sex-ness. It won’t be perfect, but it’ll
be good.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Call Quinn and Saks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m tired. I want it to end tonight, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes. I do. I want it to end now. Let her go.
I’ll come – just let her go. She’s not important.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know where.</p>

and</strong>: IT’S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME. The night seems to roar; the
lights blur and flare. A truck comes past too fast, stirring up dust and
buffeting her with wind.</p>
<p><strong>she stops, putting down window. saks rests his hand on
the</strong>: DOOR… He shoves no sign of recognizing her…</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Ma’am, please get out of your vehicle…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Merry, how… oh, Christ, of course, you had my
phone tapped.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Just get out of your vehicle…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He’s got Sergeant Halloran in there. He’ll
kill her the minute he sees or hears your people…</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: You’ve been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate
all you’ve done, and now the professional will take over…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He wants me, he doesn’t care about her. Let
me…</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Helen’s Saab speeds out of the tree
shadowed street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
brakes behind M.J.’s car.</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: HELEN. Sudden silence when she kills the car
engine. She gets out of the car. As she walks even her sneakers make an
echo from the silent stone facade… She walks up the wide stairs…</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: HELEN staring, trying to SEE. NOTHING.</p>
<p><strong>swat</strong>: Oh, man?! Let us in there.</p>
<p><strong>saks</strong>: Go. Go. Go!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You cheated! You said you’d come die with
me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Listen to them! We’ll be on all three
channels.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Kill me, Peter, do it, now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do it. If that’s what all this carnage is
about, then do it. Have enough guts to do it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Don’t talk to me about courage. I know death,
what it’s like to kill. You’re not a killer – you watched Daryll Lee
kill that cop and you didn’t make a peep, because you were paralyzed
with fear. You chocked. I know something else about you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You want one? No? There was something in you
that was fascinated, that wanted to see what it was like for a man to
die. Everybody feels it. Like every person who slows to see a bad
accident, or runs to see a fire. That’s true. I see it in you… you’re
the same as me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’ll keep talking. Until they get here.
Then…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I have no life anymore. I ruined your life,
make me pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why did you do that? Didn’t you have any idea
how hard it was for me, to get that far? I worshipped you. You inspired
me. I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.
I knew that about you – the ones you admired were the great murderers;
they fascinated you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: That’s not who I admire – I admire people who
are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t have the talent for any of those
things. All I have a talent for is death. And I am one of a kind. What
do you think of your student now? I have made you famous, I am your
creation and your monument.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If you let me, I can make you more famous
than any of them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, please. I know what’s coming, now. “Let
me help you…”</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do anything you want to me. I give myself to
you. Only put the knife down. Isn’t this what you always wanted? I know
it’s what we all want, to love and to loved. I could love you. You could
work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help
you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Back in the driver’s seat again, Doctor? That
old dream – study us to see what makes us sick. So you can find a cure –
they’d name it after you? Death is the only cure for people like me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Do it. For God’s sake, now…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>m.j. &amp; helen</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Jesus that hurts. You think the rib is
busted?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: That looks like just a bad bruise. I’ll
tape it up if you want to…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: I’ll take some Tylenol and codeine, instead,
how about a lot of number six?</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>saks and quinn emerge through the chiaroscuro of smoke
and</strong>: LIGHT AND SHADOW. When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
and hands it to him. It is what he expects, but she misunderstands – she
is offering it to him as her resignation from the cops. He takes it only
as a part of officer related shooting routine. SHE LOOKS INTO HIS
FACE</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: I’ll take it, kid. You take two weeks paid
leave. Don’t waste a second thinking about that shitbag. Then come back.
You’re a cop, M.J.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: She’s in no shape to give her statement
tonight…</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: No, she can come in tomorrow… gonna want to
know a lot of things…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The only one who could tell you what you
really need to know is dead.</p>
<p><strong>quinn</strong>: Yeah, it’s a thought…</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: You could use a long hot bath, you know that?
You better get somebody to drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why can’t I drive home? I will. You. Look at
you. You need a ride home. And you don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>m.j.</strong>: Well, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hey! Halloran! What’s the story here?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If she has to ask, she’s never gonna
know.</p>
