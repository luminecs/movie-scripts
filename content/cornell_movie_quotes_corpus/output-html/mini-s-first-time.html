<h1 id="mini-s-first-time">mini-s-first-time</h1>
<p><strong>- mini</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. Don’t bullshit
me, because I do… You’re please, I’m begging you. I’ll gouge drink right
now. I’ll jam every last kernel of popcorn into my another fucking
teenage coming-of- age story.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, relax…no prom night highjinks, no nerds
becoming popular and no Shakespeare set in high school…I promise.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE TV SCREEN. “When Animals Attack” is
on. In a series of quick cuts:</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Since it happened, everyone’s asked me how it
all started.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth
birthday…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: See, I was blessed with a terrific mom. Not
only is she a lush, but she also hates me.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: A few days before the party, I overhear her on
the phone ordering me a male stripper. Nothing says “I love you” like
ten inches of man meat in your face.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And knowing dear old ma, she’ll try and nail
him after the party…in my bed.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That guy? Our neighbor Mike Rudell, big shot
TV producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run
out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yo, bee-ach!</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Yo, birthday bee-ach!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Is it on?</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Oh, it’s on!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That’s my girl!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: See, to understand me, you need to understand
that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. “Firsts” is what
I call them.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Somewhere around fourteen, when I had my
first…rhymes with duck, I realized that the goal of life, any life,
should be to cram as many “firsts” into it as possible.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What the hell are you doing? I said wait
until- She’s not even here, you morons!</p>
<p><strong>caterer</strong>: But, but her friend said–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That was definitely a first, but more
importantly, it was the first time I really understood my potential…And
that’s when it all started.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday ever!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That little stunt got me grounded for a week,
but it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: See, I just don’t understand people who live
their lives as one big routine.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: They’re basically saying “I’m not worthy of a
unique experience on this earth.”…Well, sorry, but I am.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The law of firsts has served me well, because
it’s liberated me from the usual pathetic, repetitive concerns of high
school.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I simply don’t care if I’m popular, because if
I did, then I’d be constantly stressing about whether my clothes are
cool enough, or if Troy, the “gay but he doesn’t know it yet”
quarterback, is gonna call.</p>
<p><strong>kayla</strong>: Oh, God, it’s Troy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Just keep walking and don’t look at him.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: ROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare,
sticks his tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yo, Kayla, I got some more of what you were
looking for Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Ahh…The joys of the American educational
system.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Actually, Troy, I think you confused her with
that senile, toothless grandmother of yours.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yo, Mini, why don’t you use that mouth for
something useful and suck my dick?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Actually, now that you mention it, I can’t
think of anything I’d rather do than suck your dick.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, it’s all for you, babe.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: If you can fit it all in.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, what the?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m going to suck your dick, Troy, you said I
could.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yo, this ain’t funny!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, Troy, I want to suck your dick right
now!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Jesus, Mini, come on, get off!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, Troy! You said I could, now come on!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Let’s see it! Come on, I want to suck your
throbbing member right now!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mini?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: When I call you, I expect you to answer.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Don’t patronize me.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: If you’re trying to get me to call you a
spoiled little ungrateful bitch, you’re out of luck, because I won’t
give you the satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Thanks, mommy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m going out and I need you to wait for the
delivery from the liquor store. They’ll be here by nine.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Just thought you should know, that makes your
thighs look fat.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Gosh, you’re right, mom, I’m such a cow.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s a freakin’ miracle I’m not anorexic after
eighteen years of her little pep talks.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Have fun, don’t do anything I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, that doesn’t leave much.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Cunt.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My mother moved out to LA from Ohio when she
was twenty to become an actress. Even though she was a total flatliner,
somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps…without screwing
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: When she gets really sauced, she’ll pop the
tapes in and make me watch, then I’ll threaten to call the suicide
hotline.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: After a few years, she got desperate and
spread ’em for this fat, ugly producer when he promised to give her a
role in some bullshit cable series that was basically softcore porn. She
got knocked up with me and he told her she couldn’t be on the show,
unless she hoovered me out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Excuse me for one sec.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, Mini, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: She was gonna do it, too, at least that what’s
she told me when she was feeling particularly loving. But then she heard
rumors the show wasn’t gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child
support beat thirteen weeks on “Skin Tight”, so I got to stick around.
…Bad choice.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Anyway, what Mom didn’t count on was the prick
having a heart attack and croaking a year after I was born.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: When she tried to collect on his estate, she
found out he’d owed the government two point five in back taxes.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now, if she had been smart, she would’ve set
her sights a little lower and gone after a guy who would’ve worshipped
the ground she walked on and wouldn’t care that she already had a
kid…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But not mom, she was gonna bag another
elephant if it meant gobbling every knob from Hollywood to the
Palisades.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jesus Chr–Mini, why aren’t you in bed?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Don’t worry, Larry, she’s going to bed, right
now. Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, I will…Like some coffee for the road?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Do you want to live in this shit hole your
whole life?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Then stay in your fucking room until they
leave. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So it pretty much went on like that until…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Mini? Diane? I’m home.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Five years ago, when she met Martin.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was a win-win…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He didn’t want kids, but needed a ready-made
family to help project an image of stability for his corporate
outings…We finally got out of Reseda…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was great for about a year…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Then he figured out what he had married…by
then it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’re home early.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: First time in three months he’s walked in
before Letterman. He totally forgot my birthday party, and right now I’m
thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or…found
a new pin.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah…uh… A dinner with a client got
canceled.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Tough day?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: About the same…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Protecting all those poor defenseless oil
companies from those big bad environmentalists?</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Someone’s got to make the payments on your
Beemer.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He’s a partner at a public relations firm,
which is ironic because I can’t remember the last time he and my mom
were seen in public together…or had relations.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is your mother around?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, she went to a party off Beachwood. She was
in one of her “happy moods”, so I doubt she’ll be sleeping here…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: If you were thinking of inviting a guest
over.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wasn’t, but thanks for the concern…You’re
going out on a school night?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mmm…Is your homework done?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Haven’t even cracked a book.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mmm…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Considering how many guys my mom has done in
his bed, you’ve got to admire his resolve. He could’ve left her years
ago, but with no pre- nup, he loses half and he just won’t give in.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Their arrangement actually keeps everything
very calm.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: As I said, the rule of firsts guides my life.
Once you’ve gotten into every club in town and had enough Ivy League
lawyers cum too fast, drastic measures are called for.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I thought it would be a goof if I put a photo
ad in one of those 25 cent “outcall” massage newspapers they sell around
town. But I just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail.
So I went to an escort service, and when they found out I was 18, they
told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night…if I was up to
it.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Would you look at them?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s pathetic. I mean, she’s got to be, what?
At least twenty eight?…In dog years. Oh, wait, that would make her
four.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My first night as a call girl was a serious
let down. It turns out both guys were in town for the “Promise Keepers”
convention.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The first one got so excited I didn’t even get
a chance to get my panties off before he creamed himself.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And the other said I looked so much like his
niece, he started whimpering and praying for forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Time to bat the eye lashes…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: This? Are you kidding? My first woman and my
first cop?…It would’ve been perfect if she hadn’t wanted to cuddle
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh…wha- what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her
insightful question. Mini sighs and heads for the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Did you have fun, dear?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yeah, I turned two tricks and went down on a
dyke cop.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Thass nice…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: God, what’s gotten into her? She was almost
warm and fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: After that night, things really picked up.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My one rule which the agency wasn’t too happy
about was, of course, only firsts, no repeat customers.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But believe me, they didn’t have too much
trouble honoring that request.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’d make house calls to offices at lunch hour
and we’d say I was someone’s niece or cousin in town on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And then when football season started,
Saturday through Monday…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I was busier than Domino’s.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Then one Thursday night I get a a last minute
gig at a fuck pad in Westwood that some executive keeps so “wifey”
doesn’t find the motel bills on the gold card statements. They say I’m
just his type…young.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: They tell me he’s not big on the chit-chat and
he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Can you fucking believe it?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Uh…hi, Sorry, I’m Mlate.</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mind if I freshen up?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My own dad! My first thought was “how sick is
he?” But then I started thinking…I’m one to talk, and…well…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Why not? I mean, he isn’t my real dad…and talk
about a first. The more I thought about it…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …the more turned on I got. Then I thought that
if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed, I could do her strange
guy in this bed.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Everything alright in there?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would you mind
turning the lights off, I’m kinda new to all this and a little shy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, that’s fine, but can we get this show on
the road?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb’s tail.</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: What did you have in mind tonight?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The deluxe.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, so you want complete access?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Y…yes.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You do know that’s extra?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Just so we’re clear…Now, close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now just keep them shut for a while.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I can’t believe I pulled that off. Keeping my
face hidden actually wasn’t that hard, and he pretty much let me do
whatever I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And you know what?…He was damn good. I don’t
why Mom is throwing the cat all over town, when she can have this every
night.</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: that was…you were really good.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Thanks, Sugar.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’d like to see you again, but…uh…I never
got your name?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Ginger.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ginger, I won’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I literally couldn’t feel the ground under my
feet. A first to top all firsts. I knew I’d tell him one day, but I
wanted to savor it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ginger! You forgot your…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …Jacket.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Here’s to immediate gratification.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You were great.</p>
<p><strong>martin’s pov</strong>: A few cars rush by on the street
below. It appears to be about a three or four story drop.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Uh, that fall probably won’t kill you, and
considering what a caring nurturer your wife is, I don’t think that’s a
risk you can afford to take.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: God, what a drama queen. Don’t let this little
act fool you. He’d never let mom get all his money.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: This is just his twisted public relations
brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be
to fucking your stepdaughter…ah ha! Contemplate suicide!</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: artin backs away from the railing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now that’s thinking outside the box.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We spent the next few hours just sitting
there. I don’t think we said three words. I think he was trying to find
a way to justify the whole thing, but it was actually one of the
sweetest nights I ever spent with a guy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He told me it was a monumental mistake and
that we should both never mention it again. I told him that was
fine.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Suddenly, he started coming home every night
and even started really asking me about my homework.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Morning, Kiddo, you finish those math
problems?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Kiddo?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’d be happy to help you with it, if you
need.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Actually, I’m thinking about starting a 401K
plan at work, could you help me pick a good mutual fund?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It took exactly one week.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: In the beginning, I was concerned this would
violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer, but then I
realized this was my first affair, and with my stepfather no less. To be
perfectly honest…I loved it. Talk about electric, knowing at any moment
she could walk in was better than any drug. It reminded me of when I was
young and brought guys home after school.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: At first, we were very discreet, only doing it
when Joan Crawford wasn’t home or was completely comatose.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Then we got bolder, doing it before she would
pass out. I think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: One night we did it before “Entertainment
Tonight” ended.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We even almost got caught.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mini?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: God, I’ve told you a thousand times to
knock.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Have you seen Martin? I think he was in his
study a half hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Uh…can’t say that I have.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Well, I assume he’s gone out, so I’ve invited
Ricardo over for a…cocktail. You know how children make him uneasy, so
I’d appreciate if you and… …your friend could either stay in here or use
the back door when he arrives.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh…sure, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Okay, she’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Looking back, that may have been the moment we
fell in love.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We became inseparable.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom thought it was cute how we had suddenly
grown so close, and thought it was wonderful how Martin had taken an
interest in my education.</p>
<p><strong>close on her homework</strong>: Mini has drawn a dirty
cartoon which indicates how well endowed he is. She jots down an arrow
next to the words “actual size”.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now that we were spending time together, I
actually started to find out what Martin was like for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He wasn’t the drip I thought he was.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He was funny, charming, sweet and even a
little shy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Being seen in public was no sweat, as long as
we didn’t act like a couple.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: of the city twinkle in the background.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: This went on for two months, before we had the
talk we both knew was coming.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t want to have to sneak around in my
own house.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, I don’t think telling her is such a hot
idea.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I mean, I don’t want to live under the same
roof with her.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You can’t leave, she’ll get half.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Can I ask how the hell you married her without
a pre-nup? Her?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She wasn’t as bad an actress as you
think.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, there is another option.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: There is?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But it will take some planning… and some
resolve.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Wait, you don’t mean-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Kill her?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, of course not, she is my mother.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But I’ve been thinking, if she suddenly got
ill-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Ill?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Unstable, unpredictable, irrational…dangerous
to the safety of her husband…her child…She would have to be sent
someplace where they could give her the care she needs.</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: It would be for her own good.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The only truly caring action we could
take.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: As painful as it would be for me to be
without my loving wife.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You did it for the well being of your
daughter. The selfless act of a devoted parent.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Of course, we’ll have to make sure her
episodes are well documented.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And corroborated by friends and people outside
the family.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: A public complaint by a neighbor wouldn’t
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, that would be useful.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And we’ll find her a very comfortable place
out in the country.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: With lots of fresh air.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It will be a much better life for her.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Much.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I awoke the next morning, as excited as I
could remember. Unlike most firsts which are over too quickly, this
would take determination…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Stamina…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And imagination.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I decided to start simply.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Part one, violent mood swings-
slash-uncontrollable rages.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Fucking shit! Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m gonna be late! It took me three weeks to
get an appointment with Anton…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Anton Michelle, masseuse to the stars and
reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town. Rumor has it,
he’s pouring the pork to every rich wife between Malibu and Pasadena. He
must be incredible if Mary Magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this
early.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: …and now I’m gonna miss it because I can’t
find my fucking car keys?!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I could use a little help in here!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Coming, honey.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, sugar, do you remember where you put
them when you came home last night?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yeah, in the fucking bowl by the fucking door
where I always fucking put them!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, uh, you were kinda out of it last
night.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No, I wasn’t! I had one drink with Marie,
one!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Uh, are you sure? You did seem a bit
tipsy.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yes, I’m sure, you dickless wonder.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a
desk near the front door.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now don’t you listen to her, you are not a
dickless wonder.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mini, I’m taking your car. Martin, take her
to school.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, I have a meeting with Chapman, he’s
our biggest client–</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Tell him it’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now, here comes the really fun part. I
realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit I could do a
passable job imitating…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hello, Anton? It’s Diane Tannen, I know it’s
late notice, but I’m going to have to cancel our appointment. What? No,
of course, I realize I’ll still have to pay…yes, something came up.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Anton? But…Jeanette?</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: Uh…hi, Diane?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: But, Mrs. Tannen, you call and cancel zee
session thirty meenutes ago? D</p>
<p><strong>iane</strong>: What? No, I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Yes, I spoke to you myself, you say
sometheeng come up.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Jeanette, you knew I had an appointment
today, did you pretend-</p>
<p><strong>jeanette</strong>: No, I, I …Anton called me and told me he
had a cancellation.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Yes, I call her after you call me.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Why, you sneaky little bitch!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Needless to say, word of the L’incid�nt de
Anton spread quickly through the community.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Do you think she’ll press charges?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Are you kidding? She should get twenty to
life! When I told Margo and Penny about her little stunt, they both said
they’d have ripped her eyes out. She’ll be lucky if anyone speaks to her
again.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Here comes the choo-choo.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: For god’s sake, I didn’t break both
hands.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Jeez, I still can’t believe you broke your
hand on her face? It’s so Linda Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she
swallowed.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The store’s owner, CARLOS, 50, picking up
the</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: osa Angelica, this is Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Ah, s�, Senora Tannen, como esta?</p>
<p><strong>mini impersonating diane</strong>: Uh, Carlos…english,
comprende?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mini impersonating diane</strong>: I’m going to need a
delivery to the house.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Phase two: wild shopping sprees carried out in
a euphoric state.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Gosh, look at all the pretty flowers.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Your mother said you are having a big
party!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I know, can you believe all this?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Carlos, what the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Senora Tannen, the delivery you ordered
yesterday for the party?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Ordered, I didn’t order anything?! Who told
you to bring these here?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: But, but, Senora, you did, you called me, I
talked to you.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No, you didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: S�, you said you were having a party, don’t
you remember?</p>
<p><strong>continued: carlos</strong>: You were very excited, saying you
were going to have the most wonderful party and invite everyone you knew
and it had to be just perfect. Perfect, that’s what you said. M</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Mom, is that what you were talking about
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, it was after lunch and you had washed
your pain killers down with some wine. You mumbled something about a
party before you took a nap.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No, I did not!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom, you did. The doctor said no more mixing
pain killers and alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: But, but…I only slept for–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I am so sorry. Listen, we’ll pay, don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, god.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Right on cue. Let’s see how convincing he
is.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What is going on?! Carlos, what the fuck are
all these flowers doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oooh, now I see why he makes the big
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Se�or Tannen, we–</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Uh, Martin, I, I…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, did you order all this?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom, go inside, just go, I’ll handle him. It’s
under control, Dad. Please, let’s not make a scene.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Over the next few days, whenever Mom had
passed out from too much drinky-drinky…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’d pull out her wallet…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …and reach out and touch someone.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s really remarkable what you can order with
a Platinum card these days.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Talk about easy. After a week of my version of
the home shopping network, the doorbell might as well have been a
canon.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: At this point, dear old mummy was so spooked,
I was actually afraid she might stop drinking. So I needed a back up
plan, to keep her…off-balance.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: As we see from a closer examination of the
facts, Abraham Lincoln’s decision to…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Now, here’s someone I’d like to make sit, roll
over and then toss me his snausage. But today… priorities are
priorities.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mr. Bishop, can I go to the little girls
room?</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Of course, Mini.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The school nurse, a regimented Kraut lush
named Helga Hauptf�hrer, or “der F�hrer” as she was affectionately
known, starts jonesing for her afternoon nip…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …exactly 45 minutes after lunch each day.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Which leaves me free to help myself to the
candy store.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE LABEL indicating “RITALIN” and the
dosage.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Thank god for the quack who invented ADD and
the lazy parents willing to let “Der F�hrer” keep their kids comfortably
numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My fears of mom giving up the sauce were
unfounded. Actually, she started drinking more.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Which gave me the perfect opportunity to
prescribe her a little pick-me-up.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mini! I asked you for that drink ten minutes
ago!</p>
<p><strong>iane</strong>: Put it on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Mmm…this is really good. What’s in it,
Sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The first time in my life she calls me
“sweetie” and I’ve just slipped her the mother of all Mickeys.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, this and that.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: My god, let me tell you, breaking my hand on
that bitch’s face…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: …was the best thing that ever happened to
me.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Phase three: rambling incoherent monologues in
public.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I mean, I
feel like I could run a marathon like that Bruce Jenner guy. He did
that, right? Boy, I’ll tell you before he had that face lift that made
him look like a drag queen, I would’ve let him stick his javelin in me
any day.</p>
<p><strong>husband #1</strong>: So I looked each and every juror in the
eye-</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I want to talk to you about juries, will you
come and talk to me about juries?</p>
<p><strong>husband #1</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’d like to be on a jury and say “guilty!” or
“sidebar!” What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations?
Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other? I was once on
an episode of Love Boat, playing the role of “Bikini Girl” and my line
was “I’ll have another,” it was with “Isaac” at the pool bar. I had to
suck one of the associate producers off to get the line, but it got me
my SAG card, so I guess it was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he men shoot each other an uncomfortable
glance.</p>
<p><strong>husband #2</strong>: Uh, I think I could use a refill.</p>
<p><strong>husband #1</strong>: Me too, please, excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: But, but we were talking about juries and
Isaac and, and that drag queen I broke my face on and..</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hey! COCKBREATH!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: …And then I told him that I had been an extra
on Hello Larry and Mike Farrell had tried to–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: MacLean Stevenson.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: MacLean Stevenson played “Larry.”</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Right, that’s what I said…and then MacKenzie
Phillips tried to slip me the tongue!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Listen, great job, but you need to give me
more warning. I was at dinner with Chapman, and it’s the second time
I’ve had to re- schedule.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m sorry, but it was a golden opportunity.
You always said you can’t pay enough for good publicity.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: At this point, with all those witnesses,
Martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hey stop in front of a wall of tools: hand axes,
hammers and saws. Mini selects a large hand axe.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My feeling was that until they were ready to
weld the door to her padded cell shut…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …there was more work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Final phase: Complete psychotic breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hey, boys.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Wanna have a little fun?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Diane?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?…What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I can see you? Can you see me?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Do you feel safe?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: You didn’t answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>iane</strong>: This isn’t funny. I’m hanging up.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: If this is some kind of joke…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I assure you, I’m no joke. May I say
that pink blouse is very fetching.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Diane, your car is the other way. Now
answer my question. Do you feel safe?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I’m hanging up.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Hang up and you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Can you see me?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Pick me out something sexy.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: But I’m so close to you…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Get away!!!</p>
<p><strong>skatepunk #2</strong>: Take it easy, lady, what the hell’s
your problem?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Peek a boo…I’m coming for you…but that
guard can’t help you. Maybe you should make a run for that Gold Jag you
drive home to Mira Loma Lane.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: How do you know where I live?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I know everything about you.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No! I can’t leave, he knows where I live!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Did you hear me?! He knows where I live!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Him!</p>
<p><strong>security guard #1</strong>: Yeah, this is Franklin, we’ve got
a code 7, get an EMS unit over here.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>security guard #1</strong>: Sorry, Maam, this is for your own
protection.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: It’s him! Answer it! Answer it! He said he
was gonna kill me!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: He, he knows where I live!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: After her performance at the mall, I’m sure
she would have qualified as “committable”. But that wasn’t enough, I
wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away.</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Mom, we’re going to get some dinner. Do you
want us to bring you back something?</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: You’re leaving? Both of you?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: For the last three days she hasn’t left the
house.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Why don’t we just order in?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom, we can’t stay in here forever. Do you
want to come with us?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Ah…vanity, the most predictable of sins.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: I…can’t. You two go.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>diane’s pov</strong>: Through the window, in the distance by
the hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and
goggles. In the figure’s right hand there is a gleaming, sharp kitchen
knife.</p>
<p><strong>her pov</strong>: The figure stands silently, bringing the
knife up, indicating that he’s going to cut her throat.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: The phone dials and she waits.</p>
<p><strong>iane</strong>: Please, please, oh god.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: You have reached 911, if this is an
emergency, please remain on the line…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh god, oh god!</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Please continue to hold, your call
will be answered…</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No…no…help! Help!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Oh, God! Help! Someone!</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: No, please, no.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: violently tugs at the handle.</p>
<p><strong>iane</strong>: Help! Someone please, help me!</p>
<p><strong>peep hole pov</strong>: It appears clear.</p>
<p><strong>through the slit</strong>: everything looks good.</p>
<p><strong>diane</strong>: Please God, please God…please!</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears.
She looks up again at THE WINDOW: It’s empty. The pushing on the door
suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn’t notice through
her sobs.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Our work finished…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We rewarded ourselves on a job well done…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And we returned home expecting to find her
blabbering like a three year old.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom, we’re home!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, honey, we brought you a pulled pork
plate!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Honey? You okay?…Honey?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, it’s us, wake up.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Wake up, Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Killjoy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Diane, come on, come on.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin…</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: e looks up and immediately sees the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I picked that prescription up three days ago.
It was probably more than half full.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I suppose we should call an ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Her pulse is almost gone.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Do you really think they can save her?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I…I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: She’ll only try it again. You know she
will.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She will if we keep this torture up.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: This is wrong, call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hold on, who are we to say her choice was
wrong? She put those pills in her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Don’t “Mini” me, you’ve been bankrolling my
little project from day one.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We both agreed murder was out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’d hardly call it murder, if anything, we’re
just helping to fulfill her last wish.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: She wouldn’t have taken the pills if we
hadn’t- Mini, for gods sake, she still has a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So do people in comas. It’s just a matter of
time-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini, we-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Look, you can drop the indignant outrage,
because if you really cared, you’d have already grabbed the phone and
dialed 911 by now.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Can’t we just admit how lucky we are? It’s the
perfect alibi, she put the drugs in her system.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What? Just leave her here?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Can you think of one person she knows who
would say she’s sane at this point? This is just the natural, sad and
inevitable conclusion to a tragic life.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: artin ponders the choice.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We’re this close from being free…let’s just
let nature take its course.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And so we passed the time watching my favorite
show.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Welcome to “Absolutely Positive!” The show
where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure
they’re…</p>
<p><strong>studio audience</strong>: Absolutely Positive!</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: That’s right! We send them out on one last
date with someone other than their fiance, so they can be sure they’re
really ready to make that lifelong commitment.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the scumbag at my
birthday, produces it and it’s so twisted, I’m surprised I didn’t think
of it.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Take happy couples about to marry and try to
break them up. The catch is the couples are always sent on dates with
people just a little better looking than their fianc�s.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And we waited some more.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: dead yet.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Typical mom, she managed to fuck up her last
act of free will…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Finally, it was time to do the only humane
thing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s time to speed this up.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Speed this up?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We can’t wait anymore, our alibi is only
believable for maybe another hour. We can say that after dinner we went
to a movie, but if she hasn’t croaked by midnight, you can forget about
this.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, I’m sorry, this is going somewhere I’m
not prepared to go.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, but you were prepared to sit here until
the pills did her in? I hate to break it to you, but wherever you
“weren’t prepared to go”…the hypocrite express just rolled into the
station.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, I thought we’d disembowel her and leave
her for the raccoons.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Kidding…God, you’ve lost your sense of humor.
Don’t worry, it’ll be painless.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: To be honest, I think we both knew in our
hearts it would come to this. And as my first assisted suicide, I was
going to make it flawless. M</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Come on, we don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Look, if we’re going to screw up the details
we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch
oven. The gas chamber? Martin, please, I can’t explain everything.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I don’t think this is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Have you lost your mind, “Mr. Public
Relations”? What’s the one thing all her friends are going to be talking
about when they find out? “How did she look”? Do you think anyone will
think twice if the answer is “fabulous”?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, if you’ve got anything to say to her,
now would be the time.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Could you just pretend to have a little
remorse?</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: fumes into the sealed garage.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Help us, please! My mom, I think she’s
dead!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Mommy, wake up!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s okay, sweetheart, everything’s going to
be okay.</p>
<p><strong>first paramedic</strong>: Mr. Tannen, I think you should take
your daughter in the house.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, please, don’t let her die!</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Mr. Tannen?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m Detective Bill Garson, LAPD.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I’m sorry to be here right now, but whenever
there’s an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to
rule out homicide.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh…uh…right.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: It’s really just a formality.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My mother just killed herself! They haven’t
even taken her away yet! What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Mini, please! He’s just doing his job.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Tell him to leave! This is outrageous!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Could we do this another time?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Of course we–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: But I do need to ask just a few simple
questions before I go.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Didn’t you hear him?! He said–</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini, it’s okay…just go lie down for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: So after dinner and the movie, we came home
at around 11:30 and found her in the garage. I turned off the car and
opened the garage door to let out the exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: What about trying to revive your wife?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Of course, we did that too, but I couldn’t
feel a pulse. Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that, but…
it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: So your wife did this sometime between 8:00
and 11:33 when you placed the 911 call?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: May I ask why you left your wife alone when
she had been acting in such an unstable state?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We never thought she’d do anything
like…this. After the episode in the mall, Diane hadn’t left the house
for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break. It’s been a
very stressful time.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Of course. So this was your wife’s car?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Was it in the garage when you left for
dinner or did she drive it in?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Was it in the garage when you left?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is, is that important?</p>
<p><strong>arson</strong>: Just trying to reconstruct what happened.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, well…after she was brought home from the
mall, the car was towed here and we put it in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: And no one drove it during those three
days?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, Mini and I have our own cars.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: We are going to have to impound it for a few
days to take it to the crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Crime lab? Oh, okay.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Again, purely routine.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Have you found a note yet?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: A suicide note? The deceased usually leaves
one.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh…right, no…not yet. But we haven’t really
looked.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Mind if I take a look around?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No…of course not.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Who cares if we didn’t leave a note? Just
relax.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But they said it’s–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So what? He’ll do his little dance and chalk
it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as
well be dead.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The sweatsuits and goggles.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I already snuck out the back and threw them in
Mike Rudell’s garbage cans.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Angelpie, just relax, we did it, we’re
free.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: After the funeral, I felt it would be good
idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a
real couple for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: artin tips the BELL HOP on the way out and the
moment the door closes, Mini jumps into his arms.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin agreed and let me pick the place. I
chose Las Hadas in Mexico, because that’s where Dudley Moore and Bo
Derek did it in Ten.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I figured sugar daddy/younger woman would be
old news down there.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I could feel that Martin had let the whole
thing with the cops go. It had been two weeks since Mom’s death and it
already felt like it happened a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You know, I’ve been thinking that I might
enjoy working in your office this summer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Really? Sure, if you want.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I want.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Martin, Mini? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I swear I thought Martin was going to wet
himself.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh…hi, Mike, what, what are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: udell comes over, clearly aware of how
un-father/daughter they were lying.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming
here for a little R&amp;R, and I suddenly realized I hadn’t taken a
vacation in god knows when. Jennifer, this is my neighbor Martin Tannen
and his daughter, Mini.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m sorry, but, Jennifer, have we met? You
look so familiar.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And the icing is that Jennifer works for the
same escort service that I did. Now this is rich.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I wanted you both to know how sorry I am for
your loss.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Our loss? He just lost six or seven freebies a
year.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: If there’s anything I can do… for either of
you…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yikes, now that Mom’s out of the way, I guess
I’m fair game.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: …don’t hesitate to ask. Remember I’m just
right across the fence.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thanks, Mike, we appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why did you tell him?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I was just being friendly, I had no idea he’d
decide to come here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He knows. He found the clothes and goggles
and he fucking knows!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I doubt he even knows where his trash cans
are.</p>
<p><strong>continued: mini</strong>: You’re overreacting. It’s just
coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah, well coincidence or not, he saw us
together.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was dark, I sat up before he saw anything.
M</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: No, he knows. It was like he was toying with
us.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Just relax, what is he going to do? Go home
and tell everyone we’re a couple? We’ll just laugh it off and tell
everyone he vacations with hookers.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, come on, could that little moment between
you and Jennifer have been any more awkward?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m not jealous or anything, I just think it’s
funny. Talk about six degrees of penetration.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You realize he could blackmail us? If the
police found out about us, that suicide wouldn’t look so routine.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin, please, calm down. Trust me, nothing
is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The next few days were a laugh riot.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Suddenly, Martin was acting like he really was
my father.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We returned home and things didn’t get much
better.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What little sex we were having was getting
dull.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Quite frankly, with my little project
successfully completed…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I was bored. I became concerned that in my
world of firsts I had achieved my greatest first…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …at too young an age.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: “Happy birthday, Mr. President”</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: As for school, well, I was just in no state to
return to my studies after the trauma of my mother’s death.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Minerva Tannen, Detective Garson, I don’t
know if you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Drogues, my last name is Drogues. And “yes”, I
remember you, you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions
answered while my mother was still warm.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: So, Mr. Tannen is your stepfather?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Nice work, McGruff.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Again, I am sorry about that night, but it
is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I need to ask you a few more questions about
your mother’s death. M</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Sure, come on in.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I know, it’s stupid as hell to talk to a cop
without a lawyer, but I didn’t want to look jumpy and my first real
interrogation? I could feel something tingle deep inside.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: It’s a little early for the prom, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: A girl can dream, can’t she?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got the
preliminary coroner’s report. Although the pills knocked her out, she
died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Is it that important?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Well, it’s just a little unusual for a
suicide victim to use two methods. Her choices seemed, I don’t know how
to put it… improvisational.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the
fumes got her? She clearly put some thought into that outfit.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Clearly…But dying from carbon monoxide
poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I doubt she would have had an intimate
knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I suppose you’re right…Also we checked the
phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It was a hang up
and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was
no answer.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Any idea why she’d call 911?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing
I’ve done in a while, but even I know when the rush isn’t worth the
risk.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Look, I think you should come back when my
father’s around. He’ll be upset I let a stranger in the house. G</p>
<p><strong>arson</strong>: I think you’re safe with me.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Even so, he won’t be happy.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Not a problem, will he be home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And you let him in?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I played it cool, it would’ve looked worse to
be defensive.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, when’s he coming over?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Tonight?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Tonight!? I’ve got a dinner with Chapman.
I’ve already cancelled– Damn it! Why didn’t you call me?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hey, I didn’t know you had plans!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Listen, I’ll be home early so we can get the
story straight.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I really appreciate you taking the time to
help us out. There’s just a few loose ends we want to tie up.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Absolutely. What would you like to know?</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>: leafing through papers.</p>
<p><strong>arson</strong>: There appears to be some question as to the
time of death. You said you went to dinner and a movie-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Detective, not to be overly sensitive, but
do I need my lawyer here? Because these sound like the questions one
asks when there’s a homicide investigation.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Mr. Tannen, I’d really like to just finish
this up, I’ve got real homicides that need attention. How about if I
just ask you some questions and the one’s you don’t want to answer,
we’ll just skip?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That sounds good, doesn’t it, Dad? I mean,
let’s just get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Terrific…now, the preliminary blood report
indicated she had ritalin in her system.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wasn’t aware my wife was taking
ritalin.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Neither was her physician, he had never
prescribed it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, as you may have discovered by now, my
wife had substance abuse problems, I’m sure there were many drugs she
took without a prescription.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I know, but it’s an odd drug to be taking.
It’s mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder
to calm them. But in people who don’t need it, it has the reverse
effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Again, Detective, I really can’t say why she
was taking these drugs.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Fair enough…Mr. Tannen, were you and your
wife close?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No…we led, for the most part, separate
lives. We had decided to stay together for Mini.</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: oh…sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit
of the child. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Listen, Detective Garson, I must admit I
don’t see the relevance of these questions. Diane was an extremely
disturbed person. Haven’t you interviewed enough people who saw her at
her worst?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Yes, but what I’m still unclear about is her
time of death.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, that makes two of us… Again,
detective, we were out for the whole evening.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: After dinner you saw a movie that night?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Start time 9 o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That new Jackie Chan movie where the
terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Running time 115 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Ahh…My buddy told me the end is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: For god sakes, does he think we wouldn’t
actually see it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah, he slides down Washington’s nose with
the bomb strapped to him.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Dad…Don’t give it away, he hasn’t seen it
yet.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Another demerit…</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: That’s okay…Where did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: The Galleria.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Drive time 17 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: And you got home at?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Precisely…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: With 12 minutes of previews. You didn’t think
we’d forget the previews?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now, if there aren’t any more questions, it
is a school night.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: No, that about wraps it up for now.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: For now? Detective we are trying very hard
to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just
dredges everything back up. We’ve told you everything we know. G</p>
<p><strong>arson</strong>: I wish I could be more definitive.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, I’m telling you the next time you have
a question, it had better be because you’re charging us-</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Us?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m just asking you to please let us deal
with our grief and get on with our lives.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Thanks again for your time.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What the hell was I thinking, letting you
talk me into this?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s probably just routine stuff.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That was not routine, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Nice use of the word “us”, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sorry, it just slipped out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: If I had a nickel for every time I heard
that-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Look, just chill, I’m sure this will blow over
in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Chill?! Believe me, we’ll be chilling in a
pine box if he figures everything out. You do understand they could go
for the death penalty?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He’s probably just trying to spook us.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hello?! They don’t try and spook you unless
they think you did it!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck
those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, if it was such a great plan, why am I
cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears
convinced it wasn’t a suicide?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Would he follow?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Was there any question?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: A phone call would have been appreciated at
some point. I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Worried that refugee from a J.Lo video rode me
`til the tires fell off?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Uh…Martin, I’m not sure you’re aware, but at
this point you can’t be my dad and my lover. Where I go and how late I
stay out is my business.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wasn’t saying that as a dad. Before your
mother and I…grew apart, I would worry if she was out late.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, that’s sweet, but I’m not her and I can
assure you I won’t end up passed out in some greaseball’s fuck pad with
my panties around my ankles… u</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What the hell’s gotten into you? I just
expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me? Mini, in
a relationship, it’s okay to worry about someone else.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I kind of have to admire this. He really is
one of the world’s premiere bullshit artists.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Haven’t you ever been in a relationship?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: My god, you haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Congratulations… you’re my first.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh, angel.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And I’d like to thank the academy and god and,
oh yeah, “Free Tibet”.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Fake tears aside…he actually was my first
relationship. Which, in itself, was significant, because I had always
felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts, I would never be able
to find someone who could accept me on those terms.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And I was willing to give him the chance to be
that person…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …if he could just hold it together.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Morning, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mr. Tannen, this just arrived for you.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: That’s when things started to get
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Lois, I need you to re-schedule the Chapman
meeting… I know…Tell him…tell him it’s an unavoidable emergency.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What do you mean you don’t keep records on
who your senders are?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: When it’s paid cash, we only keep records on
packages, not envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>lois</strong>: Mr. Tannen, I just spoke to Mr. Chapman…he
told me to tell you that he’s going to be seeking a new firm to handle
his company’s needs.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you, Lois.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Steve? Charlie? What, what are you doing in
town? Why didn’t you tell me you were coming–</p>
<p><strong>ather</strong>: We just heard about Chapman…not that it
matters.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: We can’t afford to lose any more clients.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Jesus, guys, my wife just committed
suicide…</p>
<p><strong>mather</strong>: No one’s saying this isn’t a difficult time
for you, but whatever’s been distracting you started long before
that.</p>
<p><strong>boyd</strong>: There’s just no way to sugarcoat this…you’re a
liability we can’t afford anymore…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fifteen years…we’ve been–</p>
<p><strong>mather</strong>: We’ll be asking all our clients who they
would prefer to stay with, and of course, you’ll have an equal shot to
make your case with them.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking
shit!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Look at that smug prick…He’s fucking with me
and I will not be fucked with.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: I’m gonna go over there and tell him to back
off or he’s gonna get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Are you crazy? We’re not even positive it’s
him!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: My god, the picture was dropped off at a
messenger service right across the street from his office! He was the
only person at the resort who knew who we were!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He could go to the cops and tell them you
threatened him, then they’d really start investigating us. It’s just one
photo and you can’t even really tell if it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That son of bitch just cost me the firm I
worked fifteen years to build.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, if you start waving that thing around,
he’s gonna cost you a lot more than that.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin didn’t sleep at all that night and made
damn well sure I didn’t either.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: With Mommy Dearest out of the way, I decided
to take the matter of Rudell into my own hands. I knew Martin wouldn’t
approve, but at this point…action had to be taken.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I would catch him off guard, disorient him and
then kill him…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …with kindness.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hi, Mr. Rudell, I’m sorry to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Not at all, as I said down in Mexico…
anything for a neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Wow, I haven’t been here since you
redecorated.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: It was just finished. I’m sorry your mother
never got to see it completed.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I know she’d approve.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: If you don’t mind me asking, …how are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It’s been hard, but I guess I’ve just been
telling myself that she’s probably much happier where she is now.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: You’re absolutely-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Positive!?</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Well, that too, but “correct” was the word I
was thinking of. Do you like the show?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, god, it’s my favorite. I love how you
never know if the couples will decide to stay together.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: I could arrange for you to go to the set one
day if you’d like, or even be a contestant?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: A contestant? Really?</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Sure, those dates are really quite harmless.
You just spend an evening with the person. We prep you on what to say
before the show.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Anyway, what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, um…this may sound strange, but you
haven’t seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately?</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: No, is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yes, it’s just that since mom’s death, someone
sent us a photo of Martin and I together.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Together?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It indicated that we were…I know this sounds
crazy, but…a couple.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: A couple? You and Martin? Hmmm…I mean,
certainly older men and younger women are an …accepted part of society,
but for someone to do that, well…it’s just tasteless.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Exactly, so we’re just trying to figure who
Rit could be.</p>
<p><strong>udell</strong>: Hmm, I haven’t noticed anyone at all…Out of
curiosity, what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that
you and Martin were together?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, it wasn’t like we were naked or anything.
I mean, of course, he’s seen me naked, he is my step- father.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Much to my surprise, I was invited to stay for
a refreshing beverage…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I knew he had had no shortage of young women
in his bed, but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And the one undeniable fact I had learned from
Martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a man’s
life…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …than getting a ripe young woman to open the
gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Frankly, I’m surprised the anticipation of
pulling off a mother-daughter double dip didn’t give him a stroke right
there.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: “Who can take tomorrow? Dip it in a dream,
separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream, the candy man, oh, the
candy man can”</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I left that day, exhilarated in the knowledge
that in one afternoon, I had turned Rudell into a trout on a line…and
he’d follow me anywhere I tugged the pole.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: “The candy man can ’cause he mixes it with
love and makes the world taste good…”</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The photos stopped coming and although Martin
was freaking out about his business, things were returning to normal. I
even decided to return to school.</p>
<p><strong>bishop</strong>: Mini, I’ve got a message for you to go to
the principal’s office right away.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Then things got interesting again.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Detective Garson, is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: black and white surveillance tape of one of the
school’s</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Mini, this tape was shot a week before your
mother’s death.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: The next day, the school nurse reported two
bottles of Ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: We’ve lifted two prints from the door and
the inside of the medicine cabinet. They don’t match the nurse.</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: Mini, is there something you’d
like to say to Detective Garson?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Can we see the tape of the Der F�hrer sucking
down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff, or don’t you have cameras in the
bathroom stalls?</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: Young lady, stealing anything,
especially prescription drugs is a serious matter.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You got me, okay? But what was I supposed to
do?</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: She…She said if I didn’t, she was…was
gonna–</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: Who? Another student?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: My mother! She made me steal them for her! I
didn’t want to, but she said she was going to send me to boarding school
in Canada if I didn’t! P</p>
<p><strong>rincipal andrews</strong>: Canada?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The Yukon territories! Are you happy, now? You
got me!</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: Oh my lord, I had know idea, she
was–</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: An addict? Detective Garson knew! We told him,
and now what? The whole school’s gonna know!?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: She’s dead, my mommy’s dead. Can’t we just
leave her be?</p>
<p><strong>principal andrews</strong>: Detective Garson, I assume, there
won’t be a need to press charges against Ms. Drogues?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You gonna cuff me, Copper!?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: She’s free to go.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Ah, Mr. Tannen, we were just coming up to
see you. Have you got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Detective, I told you no more questions
without my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I think you’d better call him.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: There’s a small discrepancy that I can’t
quite figure out and I was hoping you might be able to explain it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I suppose I can try.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: The final toxicology report came back and
your wife definitely didn’t die from the pills. She wasn’t conscious
past 9:30, but it was the fumes that killed her.</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Well, hallelujah, thanks for the update-</p>
<p><strong>volant</strong>: Martin, easy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m sorry, but this is harassment.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: See, here’s what I needed to ask you. The
gas tank in the Jag was almost full, just a gallon had been used.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that
means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you
found her. An unconscious person can’t turn on a car, right?</p>
<p><strong>volant</strong>: Detective, with all due respect, could you
get to the point?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Well, here’s where I get confused, see, that
particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of
gas.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: So, there’s really no way the tank could be
almost full if it was running for two hours. Is there?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: So, I guess what I’m asking is, whose idea
was it to put her in the car?</p>
<p><strong>volant</strong>: Martin, don’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had the most to
gain from her death, but I’ve learned from a number of your wife’s
friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship.</p>
<p><strong>volant</strong>: Again, Detective, my client won’t be
answering anything, so let’s just cut the cat and mouse.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: I’d like Mr. Tannen to know that if he’s
trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did, I’d
be careful. The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity
to show the public that the rich don’t get away with murder in this
town.</p>
<p><strong>v</strong>: whispers back.</p>
<p><strong>olant</strong>: Does this mean he’s offering Mr. Tannen
immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: It’s a strong possibility. But he wants
Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesn’t. No
manslaughter, no plea bargains, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the
candlestick.</p>
<p><strong>pelham</strong>: Uh…Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Don’t wet your pants, I know when to shut up
and swallow…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …my tongue.</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: Look, the fact that the marriage was unhappy
and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So you want me to say it was his idea?</p>
<p><strong>garson</strong>: If it was his idea, give me one reason you
should take the fall?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: At that moment I knew we had him. If he was
trying to get me to rat on Martin, he didn’t have enough to charge
either one of us.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: So if I tell the jury it was his idea and I
was scared for my life, because he said he’d kill me if I ever told
anyone, then I walk?</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Sorry, sport, but I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I never doubted for a minute you were going
to hold firm. Not a second. I hope you know that?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, I knew…I knew.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Good. You realize, we’ve got to rely on each
other?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Who else do we have?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Exactly. We’re almost home free. My lawyer
says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell. I’ve only got one
concern now.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Rudell. If a jury knew we were a couple,
we’ve both got a motive and that changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Baby, don’t worry about him, he’s just jealous
‘cause you’ve still got rockin’ abs and a better hairline.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Even if he did send that picture, what does it
prove?…Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: For all of Martin’s talk of relying on each
other…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of
distrust.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Our relationship had turned into what some
might call…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …unhealthy.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Something had to give, and ironically enough,
it was the night I was making my television debut.</p>
<p><strong>continued: mini</strong>: I had asked Martin to be home by
eight for a big surprise.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, hey, come and watch. You’re missing me,
I’m on TV!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hurry up, the commercial’s almost over!</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Welcome back to Absolutely Positive. Now it’s
time to hear how the date between Jason and Mini ended.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You? You went on-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yeah, I thought it’d be a gas…now shhh…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Jason, you said that the reason you wanted to
come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Well, since Becky and I have dated since high
school and decided to remain virgins until marriage, I just wanted to go
on a date with another girl just to see how I would react. You know,
whether there’d be any feelings of doubt about my decision?</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: So, after dinner, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go to a dance
club she knew. I’m not really a good dancer, but I said “yes.”</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: We never go dancing.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer?</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Well, he’s a damn quick learner, and not just
at dancing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin, for god’s sake, that was their line.
You think I talk like that?</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Oh, really? So there was some other
teacher-student stuff going on?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Uh, no, not really-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, come on, what about when we went back to
your place?</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: You what?!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I, I don’t know what she’s talking about.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Come on, don’t be bashful. He put on some soft
music and-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No! This isn’t true, why are you-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: We started kissing and-</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But, Jay-Jay, it was really special. He loves
to be called “Jay-Jay”.</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: You, you…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Let me tell you, Becky, you’re in for a wild
ride from this Bronco.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Did, did you…</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: You slept with her?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: God, Martin, it was a one time thing. He was a
virgin, how could I say “no”? Believe me, she’ll thank me after their
wedding night.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You had me come home early to-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Don’t be jealous. It won’t happen again. It
was just a goof.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Rudell? He let you go on?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I wasn’t
really supposed to, you know, “go all the way” but-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I can’t believe you…th-that couple, you
ruined their relationship.</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Excuse me, but the show is called Absolutely
Positive for a reason. Clearly, the only thing Jason was positive about
was-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You’re a sick little twist, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Well, what does that make you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I need some air.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, by the way, some intern from your office
stopped by earlier today with something. It’s on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, my god.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I think it’s time I had a little chat with
our neighbor</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, this is exactly what he wants! What if
he’s working with Garson?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Then he can’t blackmail me. Wait here, I’ll
be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No, please, don’t do this! Let me go with
you!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I said wait here.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Don’t do this, we can leave tonight! We’ll
drive to Mexico!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He’ll never leave us alone, you realize
that?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No! Let me talk to him, he promised me he
wouldn’t hurt us!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: He did? When?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: A few days ago!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You saw him?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I went to try and find out what he knew! I
spent the afternoon with him- M</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: You…spen-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I was doing it for us! I figured he wouldn’t
turn us in if I…</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: If you…?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: If I made him think I was… interested.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: And was he?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Please tell me you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I just made him think I would, so he wouldn’t
turn us in.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you, I appreciate your restraint.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Fuck you. I’d think you’d be a little more
appreciative.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Who were you doing it for when you did it
with that kid? Huh? Who was that selfless act for!?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, like you’re such a martyr for being
faithful? It shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one
stepdaughter!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t lecture me about fidelity! Your mother
was cheating within six months of the “I do’s”!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Please– Look, I’m sorry, I really am, but this
isn’t the answer!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Calm down or I’ll snap it in two, do you
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Now, I want you to wait here for me. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Please don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: “Nice and Easy” is playing on his stereo in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>udell</strong>: Martin, what a surprise, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Just watched Mini on your show.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Ahh…was tonight the night? We taped that two
weeks ago. Let me tell you, I have girls audition all the time for me
and… She was fucking incredible.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: A natural, huh?</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: Like a duck to water…and totally willing to
take direction.</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: I wish all the girls I worked with had
her…how can I put this?… Need to please.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You son of a bitch…</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “Let’s take it nice and easy…”</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Yes, hello, you’ve got to send a police car to
2376 Mira Loma Lane right away! My father’s gone crazy, I think he’s
going to hurt our neighbor…yes 2376 Mira Loma, oh god, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “Hey, baby, what’s your hurry? Relax, don’t
you worry…”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Where are they?! Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: What are you talk-</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t fuck with me! The negatives!</p>
<p><strong>rudell</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “The problem now of course is, to simply
hold your horses…”</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “To rush would be a crime…”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You son of a bitch! How’s that feel?! You
like that?! You thought you could have my wife and my daughter too?!</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “`Cause nice and easy does it, nice and
easy does it…”</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sorry, pal, she’s mine! Diane may have taken
pity on you between vodkas, but not her! Not her!</p>
<p><strong>artin</strong>: Now tell me where they are or I swear to god,
I’ll crack your head open!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Go look for the negatives!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No! This is insane!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We need the negatives!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’re gonna kill him!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What are you doing! He’ll tell everyone!</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Freeze, police!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Drop the club and put your hands up!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Thank God! Thank God, you came!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini, you called them?! How could you call
them?!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: He’s…he’s crazy, I told him not to! I told him
to stop!</p>
<p><strong>sinatra</strong>: “Nice and easy does it…every time.”</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Needless to say, my appearance on Absolutely
Positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town.</p>
<p><strong>tv video footage of</strong>: Mini at Martin’s trial sitting
in the front row.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The trial was quick. Once Mom’s affair with
Rudell came out, the D.A. realized he had a motive and a slam dunk.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a
harsh eye towards Martin and then reads the verdict.</p>
<p><strong>forewoman</strong>: Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Since, Rudell was in a coma, the issue of my
relationship with Martin was moot. Martin realized trying to pin
anything on me would probably get him the chair.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: At his sentencing I begged for leniency. He
got off with ten for the attempted murder of Rudell and twenty to life
for mom’s death.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The outpouring of support was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Martin’s assets were put in a trust for me and
since I was eighteen, I was allowed to live by myself.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m sorry I forgot to bring that book you
wanted.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It’s okay, Myou can mail it.</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Are you okay? You look like you haven’t
showered in days.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well…uh…you have to be careful about sh-…So
how’s school?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You’ll never guess what happened.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I was voted valedictorian!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But don’t you have to be-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: The best student? I know! But the students
took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating
remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I wonder how the real valedictorian
feels?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of
a protractor.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Is Rudell out of his coma yet?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I don’t know, why?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Why? Mini, if he recovers, he may try to
blackmail you with those pictures.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh…I wouldn’t worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But if the D.A. got those pictures, you
could-</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I’m pretty sure he won’t be doing anything
with them.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Mini, you’re not thinking of sleeping with
him to keep him quiet? Because I’ve met people in here who could help us
with him, if it comes to that.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Help us?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: They know people on the outside we could…pay
to make sure he doesn’t try to take advantage of you.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, gosh, that’s so romantic. It’s like you’re
a real life criminal with connections and everything, but I’m a little
surprised you haven’t figured it out yet.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh…wow, like I thought you were just playing
along `cause I’m your only link to the outside world, but you really
don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>ini</strong>: Rudell didn’t send those pictures.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: You remember, Aurelio?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Our cabana boy from Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: What a sweetie, I thought I might have to fuck
him, but just giving him the camera was enough.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You…you…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: It was pretty clear Garson wasn’t gonna give
up, and sooner or later he’d find enough to charge us. It just seemed
ridiculous that we’d both end up suffering.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Oh, come on, you would’ve done it if you
thought of it first…you know I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty
much out of the question, I thought it would be cool if we tried a
little prison phone sex.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: They don’t tap these lines, do they? I think I
might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing…you
ready?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Guard!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: No? Are you sure? I won’t be able to come back
for a few weeks. Wait, have you met someone in here?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Guard!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Why, you old dog! I knew you wouldn’t be
single in here for long.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Guard! She did it! She just admitted it! It
was her idea!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: I guess this means I could start dating around
too?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t let her leave! She’s guilty! Get the
warden!</p>
<p><strong>uard</strong>: Okay, that’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: You bitch! You little whore!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Daddy, why are you saying those things!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I’m gonna kill you! Do you hear me, you
little bitch!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Daddy, stop! I love you! Don’t say that! I
love you!</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …As many of you know, the past few months of
my life have been very difficult. I don’t know how I would have gotten
through it without all of you. I really think it is a testament to the
love in this institution, that I stand before you today, as the first
straight “C” student in school history voted Valedictorian.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the real
valedictorian, he deserved this and I want to wish him a speedy
recovery. I spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and
therapy, Marvin should be able to attend Harvard this fall.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: While I may not have excelled in the
classroom, I think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we
call “life”, have taught me a few lessons that I’d like to share with my
fellow graduates.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Follow your heart and don’t question it, now
matter where it tells you to go. Trust me, it’ll open up a world of new
experiences you can’t even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: But as you listen to it, don’t forget your
family, your parents. Don’t forget they’re people too, and while we may
not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need
love.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And I mean really love them, don’t just pay
them lip service. Really do it…Whenever you can.</p>
<p><strong>continued: mini</strong>: I know I did, and I just wish my
dad could be here today, so after this speech I could just walk down
into the audience and give him my love right here…in front of all of
you. Thank you and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: Like I promised, no prom night highjinks, no
nerds becoming popular, no Shakespeare shoved up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: And in case you’re feeling guilty about having
no one to identify with but me, relax…</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong>: …There’s a first time for everything.</p>
