<p><strong>second draft</strong>: July 20, 1984</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I should have caught you at the boat yard
when you got off work. You don’t want to talk about it here…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it anywhere. If
you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will
be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: How much do you know?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What was in the ‘Miami Herald’ and the
‘Times.’ Confessions?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes
the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What else did you keep out of the
papers?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears
a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He’s on a full
moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Somebody hurt him?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Typed him from semen. He’s a secretor.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Will… you saw this in the papers. The
second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin’ me a
call?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus
you have Bloom at the University of Chicago…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: And I got you down here fixing fuckin’
boat motors.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You don’t need me. I wouldn’t be useful to
you anymore, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Last two like this we had, you caught.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That was three years ago. And by doing the
same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: That’s not entirely true, Will. It’s the
way you think.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I think there has been a lot of bullshit
about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You look all right now.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I am all right.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: If you can’t look anymore, I
understand…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: As long as they’re dead…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: These are all dead, Will.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let’s talk after dinner. Stay and eat.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’LL come back later. I got messages at
the Holiday Inn to collect</p>
<p><strong>int. graham’s kitchen - molly + graham - night</strong>: are
doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: He stopped by to see me at the shop before he
came out here.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: He asked how you are.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And you said?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I said you are fine, he should leave you the
hell alone.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m a forensic specialist, Molly. You’ve
seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your
diploma. You are open and easy now… It took you a lot of work to get to
that…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We have it good, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: All the things that happened to you before
make you know that…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What the hell can I do?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What you’ve already decided. You’re not
really asking.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: If I were?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin.
That’s selfish, huh?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t care. He’ll never see me or know my
name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I’m
just looking at evidence.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Will it keep them out?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah. ..</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How many turtle eggs you think are in
here?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Crabs would get most of the newborns before
they made it to the sea, huh?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it…
guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Whatever I say, you’ll take him away, won’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You’re his friend, Jack. Why can’t you leave
him alone?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Because it’s his bad luck to be
special.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: He thinks you want him to look at
evidence.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Nobody’s better with evidence. But he has
the other thing, too. He doesn’t like that part of it…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You wouldn’t like it, either if you had
it.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Talking about ‘like,’ you don’t like me
very much, do you?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: No. I don’t like people who park in the
‘handicapped zone’…</p>
<p><strong>crawfrod</strong>: I’LL try to keep him as far away from it
as I can…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Thanks for the lift.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I’ll come inside with you, if you like, but
Mr. Crawford said you’d probably want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>offtcer</strong>: There’s a VTR setup waiting in your hotel
room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both
families once half-inch VHS.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>int. leeds master bedroom - light switch</strong>: Graham’s
hand enters. He hits the light switch.</p>
<p><strong>close: graham</strong>: doesn’t visibly react.</p>
<p><strong>wider - graham</strong>: moves into the room. The bloodstains
are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock.
The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where
the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing
autopsy, lab and crime reports.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: intruder entered through kitchen sliding
door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn’t he care that he left AB saliva
on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must’ have
been pleasantly cool to him. The intruder cut Charles Leeds’ throat as
he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising…
Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine,
but she died of strangulation… increase of serotonin and free histimine
levels in the gunshot wound indicates… she lived at least five minutes
after she was shot… All her other injuries were post-mortem. Then he
went toward the children’s room. Direction and velocity of blood stains
on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut,
Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the
children’s room… in the children’s room the intruder shot the first boy
in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was
dragged out from under his bed to be shot…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding
marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained…
as does superficial chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the
killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys
back in their beds?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There’s a wicker dog bed on the back porch.
There’s a doghouse in the back yard. Where’s the dog?</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer #1</strong>: …like to rip me off a piece of
that!</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer #2</strong>: Fuck her ’til her nose bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>conventioneer #1</strong>: What the fuck are you lookin’
at?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: When they were dead – except possibly
Mrs. Leeds – he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he
used later on Mrs. Leeds… What did he do in the interval? Struggling
with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute.
What else? Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed’s
arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Molly?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Huh? Will? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s me. I’ll call you tomorrow, sweetheart.
Go back to sleep. I love you…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Mmmmh… I love you, too, Will. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot: the room - graham</strong>: VTR backs up, starts
to play and we see the image of Mrs. Leeds again in the home movie: they
follow the yellow rib- bon down the stairs to a bicycle. It’s indoors.
It’s rain- ing outside. The eleven-year-old Leeds boy is ecstatic.
Mrs. Leeds smiles.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You moved the kids after you killed them,
didn’t you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on
their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That’s the
postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did
you open their eyes? There is something you can’t afford for me to know
about. Isn’t there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn’t she? It was maddening
to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn’t it? There was talcum
powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. The
powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in
Latent Prints?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He’s working on the single print index.
What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You said the guy down here is good.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He is good. Bur not as good as Price.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Mrs. Leeds’ fingernails and toenails. I
think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all
their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: Our people swear he wore surgeons’
gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The report didn’t mention nails and
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: Why do you think he took his gloves
off?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I’d
want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: ’Intimate? !”</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. ‘Intimate.’ They had privacy. Everybody
else was dead.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: All right. House to house interviews
will be extended four additional blocks. R &amp; I has loaned us two
clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham
last month and between Atlanta now. Dr. Princi.</p>
<p><strong>dr. princi</strong>: This is what the subject’s teeth look
like. The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the
impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the
Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham. incisors – the teeth here and
here.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: Investigator Graham has worked this
kind of thing before. Can you add anything?</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: Can’t hear you. Can you come up to the
front?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He may have a history of biting – barroom
fights or child abuse.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: He only bit women so far, right?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s all we know about.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Most of the time in sex assaults the bite
mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don’t. So, for
him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. You
could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know
that’s pretty thin… He bites a lot.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: What’s average?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad
ones in Mrs. Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the
K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the
funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: One more thing: I’ve heard officers
referring to the killer as the ’Tooth Fairy. Yeah, yeah, but I don’t
want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: We don’t have shit, and we know it.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: The Commissioner was saying you were
the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. He killed nine people,
didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Nine that we know of. Two didn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: One’s on the respirator at a hospital in
Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: What did the psychologists say was
wrong with Lecter?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Psychologists call him a sociopath. They
don’t know what else to call him.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: What would you call him?</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: To yourself…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I call him a monster.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: I understand he cut you pretty
good…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What about the dog?</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: It’s at the vet’s. The kids brought it
in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds’
name on it?</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a
dog?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: A cat. We found a litter box downstairs
but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Why don’t you get Birmingham P.D. a methane
probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard… maybe the cat’s dead
and the kids buried it.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie price</strong>: Who am I talking to?</p>
<p><strong>crawiiord</strong>: Jimmie, it’s me, Jack Crawford, and you
got Will Graham here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie price</strong>: I got a partial with a tented arch
that’s probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie price</strong>: Came off the oldest kid’s left eye. It
stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Can you make an identification off it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie price</strong>: Don’t know. The palm came off the nail
of Mrs. Leeds’ left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom.
I’ll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>springfield</strong>: thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his
expression is very changed.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I
covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback… !</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: When did they call you in, Will? What have
you got?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Lounds, give it a rest…</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: How does this guy compare with Lecter? How
does he do them?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Keep the fuck away from me!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Get the hell away from here, Lounds!</p>
<p><strong>int. diner, booth - graham + crawford - day</strong>: Graham
is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is
looking at him. Finally:</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: …snuck in the hospital while I was sedated,
flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did
was run a black square over my balls…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb
print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don’t come
up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program… if he’s
ever been printed and in his Index.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Say we’ve arrested a good suspect. You
walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn’t surprise
you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t know, Jack. He’s got no face for
me.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You can tell something about him or we
wouldn’t have found the finger print. ..</p>
<p><strong>graham.</strong>: Don’t expect too much from me, Jack, all
right? We’ll get him one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What’s one way?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We find an event that connects both
families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we
check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever… If
we find out how he found them, then we’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: We’re running it through the computers
now. So far there’s no event or service that doubles back into both
families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips,
scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It’s a haystack.
What’s the other?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He makes noise going in and the husband gets
to a gun in time.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No other possibilities?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You think I’m gonna spot him ‘across a
crowded room?’ That’s Ezio Pinza you’re thinking about.</p>
<p>****: 21.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get
smart or get lucky. He won’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Because he has a genuine taste for it,
Jack.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: See? You do know something about him.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … I’m going to see Lecter.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: For Christ’s sake, why?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: To recover the mind set.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Hello, hotshot!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hey, baby! Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: At the store. You doin’ some good?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: None you’d notice. I’m lonely…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Me, too. And very erotic…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Tell me about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Which part? That or the day-to-day.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let’s keep it the day-to-day stuff. How’s
Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Kevin’s fine. He had to recover the turtle
eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Eating junk food. They don’t have a lock on
anything, Molly. There’s not enough information. Or I haven’t done
enough with it…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I’m not
buggin’ you about coming home, I just wondered.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Z don’t know. I’m goin’ up to Baltimore this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: To do what?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I have to see somebody.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I’m thinking about painting the kitchen. What
color do you like, Will? Are you there?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah. Ah… yellow, let’s paint it yellow.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Yellow’s a bad color for me. I’LL look green
at breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Blue, then.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Blue is cold.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for
all I care… Look, I’m sorry. When I come home, we’ll go to the paint
store together and get some chips and…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will, I don’t know why I’m talking about this
stuff… I called to tell you: I love you and I miss you. And you are
doing the right thing. It’s costing you, too. And I know that. And I’m
here. I’LL be here whenever you come home. Or I’LL meet you anywhere.
Anytime. That’s what I called to say…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby.
..</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I love you…</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Dr. Bloom called me yesterday,
Mr. Graham. Or should I call you Dr. Graham?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m not a doctor. I need to see Lecter in as
much privacy as possible.</p>
<p><strong>two shot</strong>: Graham sits in front of his desk in a
chair. He appears repressed, clamped down. Dr. Chilton is a sincere
Chief of Staff, but not gifted.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Dr. Lecter will stay in his room. That
is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body
restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a
chair put just outside.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I might have to show him some material that
could stimulate him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: As long as it’s on soft paper. You may
find this curious.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Here Lecter’s resting on the examining
table getting an electrocardiogram. Complained of chest pains. Pulse
seventy-two. Here he grabs the nurse’s head and pulls her down to him.
Here he’s subdued by the attendant and Lecter’s shoulder is dislocated.
Do you notice the strange thing? His pulse never got over eighty- five.
Even when he tore into her face.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: The consensus around here is that the
only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of
Dr. Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about
him?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: When you saw Dr. Lecktor’s murders,
their ‘style,’ so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies?
And did that help you identify him?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I want to see Lecktor now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Uh… sure…</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: That’s the same atrocious aftershave you
wore in court three years ago.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I keep getting it for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Did you get my card?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I got it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>graham’ s</strong>: struggle will be to keep locked-down
inside himself all his emotional reactions.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was
the first to see my basement.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Stuart is fine.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very
promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Of course, you don’t. I’m glad you came. My
callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield
colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical
addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Very interesting, even to a layman.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So
many experts on government grants. And you say you’re a ‘layman?’ But it
was you who caught me, wasn’t it, Will? Do you know how you did it’</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’ve read the transcript. It’s all
there.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: No it’s not. Do you know how you Did it
Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s in the transcript. What does it matter
now?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: It doesn’t matter to me, Will.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Yes, I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s about Atlanta and Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You read about it, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: In the papers. I don’t rear out the
articles. I wouldn’t want them to think I was dwelling on anything
morbid. You want to know how he’s choosing them, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I thought you would have some ideas.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Why should I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There are things you don’t have. Research
materials… I could speak to the Chief of Staff…?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Chilton? Gruesome, isn’t he? He fumbles at
your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries
to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for
MF-13 to come up. It’s a card with a woman in bed and a man in the
foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed
in his face. Never mind, it’s boring.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’ll get to see the file on this case. And
there’s another reason.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Pray tell.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I thought you might be curious to find our
if you’re smarter than the person I’m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Then by implication, you think that you are
smarter than me, since you caught me.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No. I knew that I’m nor smarter than you
are.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Then how did you catch me, Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You had disadvantages.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: What disadvantage?.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: You’re very tan, Will.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Your hands are rough. They don’t look like
a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would
select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Don’t think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t think I’ll persuade you. You’ll do
it or you won’t. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he’s the
best…</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Do you have the file with you</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Pictures?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: let me have them,, and I might consider
it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Do you dream much, Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: You haven’t threatened to take away my
books yet.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: let me have the file. Then I’ll tell you
what I think.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He
doesn’t take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: There is a very shy boy, Will.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: What were the yards like?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim
imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside
and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite
black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for
this sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s interesting.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: It’s not ‘interesting’. You thought of it
before.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. I’d considered it.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: You came here to look at me, Will. To get
the old scent again, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I want your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: I don’t have one right now.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: When you do have one I’d like to hear
it.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: May I keep the file?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: I’ll study it, Will. When you get more
files, I’d like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call
my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your
home number?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Do you know how you caught me, Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages
for me at the number on the file.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Do you know how you caught me?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: The reason you caught me, Will, is: we’re
just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself.</p>
<p><strong>int. light trap-door - day</strong>: slams open. Dollarhyde
enters. As he reaches the next door…</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: Mr. Dollarhyde?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Yes, Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>eileen</strong>: On the densitometer it came out within
tolerances.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Thank you, Eileen.</p>
<p><strong>extremely close: second image of will graham</strong>: in
newsprint, the one Lounds took at the Chesapeake hospi- tal. The
half-tone dots comorising the image are visible. Dollarhyde’s massive
finger slides across the image, brush- ing it sensitively. It works its
way to Graham’s face and the finger stops and blots it out.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Thank you so much. I’ll call you when I’m
finished.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom,
University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please? Thank you.
Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: He’s not in today, bur I’ll connect you
with his office…</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: What’s his secretary’s name again…?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Linda King. Just a moment.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: Linda King’s desk.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Hi, Linda. ..</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: Linda doesn’t come in nights.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of
Blaine &amp; Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a
copy of ‘The Psychiatrist and the Law’ to someone. Linda never sent me
the address and phone number.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: She’ll be in, in the morning…</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: I have to catch Federal Express within
about five minutes. I’d be immensely appreciative if you’d pull it out
of her Rolodex for me.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: She doesn’t have a Rolodex.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: I’LL bet she has a call caddy right next to
her phone.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: Yeah. ..</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Well, zip that little Pointer right on down
to the letter G.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: We’re looking for Graham. The man the book
is supposed to go to is a Ms. Will Graham.</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington,</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Now I’ll bet it has his home address there,
too</p>
<p><strong>graduate student</strong>: 3680 DeSote Highway. Marathon,
Florida.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Clears the trays.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marathon boatyard - diesel engine - day</strong>: moves
down to us…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Block her off, Mitch…</p>
<p><strong>graham’s eyes</strong>: In horror. And O.S., we hear
SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we…</p>
<p><strong>geehan</strong>: It was last Thursday. This</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Have any single men asked to look at it?</p>
<p><strong>geehan</strong>: Haven’t asked me. Took four coats of
interior latex, five in places. You can drop that key in the mailbox.
You don’t have to come back by, do you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>ext. jacobi house - wide - day</strong>: An image from Bill
Owens’ “Suburbia.” A family house. No different than any other family
house around. But it is somehow sinister in its vacancy. It ought to be
littered with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban
normalcy. TRACK LEFT to reveal the back of Graham staring at the house
from across the street.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … after you killed the cat and threw it into
the yard, my man, you climbed up hero and waited. You used a cutting
tool on these branches so you could see.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You watched the children and passed the time
whittling and dreaming. When night came, you saw them passing their
bright windows and you watched the shades go down, and you saw the
lights go out one by one. And after a while, you climbed down and you
went in to them, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>long! !</strong>: That’s why you like houses with big yards,
the easier to see them</p>
<p><strong>geehan</strong>: They don’t build houses this way anymore:
solid lath and plaster construction. None of your drywall stuff and
aluminum studs here. No sirree Bob!</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: I like it, hon.</p>
<p><strong>husband</strong>: Let’s go to your office and see if we can
work out some terms…</p>
<p><strong>geehan</strong>: Great. You goin’ love this house!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust
for prints. I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I
need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch.
I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Is it weird?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The mark? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: If the Documents section can’t do it… I’ll
send it up to Langley…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did Price get anywhere with the single
prints off the Leeds?</p>
<p><strong>sarah crawford</strong>: Special Agent Crawford’s No. The
killer’s not in office.. the Single Print Index. He</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, Mr. Graham is not in the office, bur let
me… Wait, I’ll be glad to… Yes, he’ll be in the office later, but let
me…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: … bur if we find him, the print as
evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He asked for Will. He said he might call back
tonight. I tried to hold him… I’m sorry… He said ‘tell Graham “broken
mirrors.”’</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Will. Get right back here. He just
called.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Who did he ask for?</p>
<p><strong>cbawford</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>dr. bloom</strong>: Anybody want the rest of the cholesterol
special?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Thanks, no.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: …so how do I play him, Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>dr. bloom</strong>: Compliment him. Tell him most people
don’t have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened,
that sort of thing. If he’s paranoid, play into his grievance. Let him
air it. If he’s picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat, give him
what he’s after. A little at a time.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: … very little. If it’s all electronic
switching we’ll need a minute for the trace.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Special Agent Crawford’s office. Bill, call
back on twenty-four four. We need to keep this line clear…</p>
<p><strong>int. men’s room - faucet - night</strong>: Runs water.</p>
<p><strong>int. cbawford’s office - crawford - night</strong>: Looking
through reports. He picks up a pencil and starts to correct a line when:
RING.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Where the hell’s Graham!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He went to the men’s room.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: For Christ’s sake get him!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Special Agent Crawford’s office. Could you
hold on a second, I’ll see if I can find him.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This is Will Graham. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: No. I can help you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Atlanta and Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do you know something about that?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Why do you think I called?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from
people who say they know things .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Talk to them a few minutes and</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: You tell me what you know about him. I’ll
tell you whether you’re right or not.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let’s get straight who we’ve talking about.
Are you the man I’m interested in?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I don’t think I’ll tell you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s right-handed.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Most people are.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s misunderstood.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Cut the general crap.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s very strong physically.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s white and six feet tall. You haven’t
told me anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Describe exactly what you think he did to
Mrs. Leeds and I’ll tell you if you’re right or not.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t want to do that,</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: Freeze. Don’t even twitch. Now lock your
fingers behind your head and back our of the booth slowly. Spread
’em!</p>
<p><strong>crawford’s</strong>: ecstatic .</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: Who am I speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>graram</strong>: Will Graham, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>2nd voice</strong>: This is Sergeant Stanley Riddle, Chicago
Police Department. Will you tell me what the hell’s goin’ on</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You tell me. You have a man in custody?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant riddle</strong>: Damn right. Freddie Lounds.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant riddle</strong>: Can you hear me? Are you preferring
charges against him or you want him to just run along…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah. I’m preferring charges! Obstruction of
justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney!
You…</p>
<p><strong>ext. chicago street, phone booth - freddie lounds -
night</strong>: grabs for the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Will, listen…</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Dr. Chilton.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector’s cell,
he heard us coming and hid something in a book.. We got him out of there
and dug around…</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Do you have it?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Yeah. It’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Put it down on my desk blotter and
don’t touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>int. crawford’s office - night</strong>: Sarah answers the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Special Agent Crawford’s office.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you!</p>
<p><strong>dr. cbilton</strong>: I said I need to speak to Special Agent
Crawford or Mr. Graham. Right away!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham
are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: This is Dr. Chilton. At the Chesapeake
Hospital. Will you please call them this is very, very urgent!!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: How’d you know ‘broken mirrors?’ Bribe a
cop? Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it’s
urgent.</p>
<p><strong>graram</strong>: It’s Will Graham…</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Well, it’s about goddamn time! I have a
note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who
killed those people in Atlanta and….</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Where did you get it?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: From Hannibal Lecktor’s cell. It was
hidden in a book.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Run along to the police station, Freddie.
We’ll talk to you when we get around to it…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Can you read it to me?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: It’s written on toilet tissue. ’My dear
Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I’m delighted that you’ve taken an
interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I’m becoming.
’I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help
me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing
change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of
light is burning. Mr. Graham, there’s a hole torn and punched our, then
it says… ’I have a complete collection of your press notices. f think of
them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The “Tooth Fairy.” What could be more
inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful
locking. I hope we can correspond. There’s another piece missing here.
I’LL read the bottom part. ’After I hear back from you, I might send you
something wet. Signed: Avid Fan. It has teethmarks pressed in it at the
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>cbawford</strong>: Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next
thing smoking and I don’t care whose. Ours. DCPD. Or the Marines. Then
call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in
five minutes. Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a
Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: After we’ve worked the note we want to
replace it in Lecktor’s cell. I don’t want him to know we found it.
Where’s Lector now?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: In a holding cell.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How long can you keep Lecktor out without
him getting suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>dr. chilton</strong>: Three, four hours.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Have your building superintendent shut off
the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor’s hall. Have him walk
through carrying tools and being pissed off or something,</p>
<p><strong>dr. chiltdn</strong>: Yes. We can manage all that.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Brian. We have a note coming in on the
fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go
to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be
walking it through…</p>
<p><strong>beverly katz</strong>: One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty-
second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I’ll work it up. What else
have you got?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hair from Lecktor’s comb. Whiskers from an
electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Perspiration stains, nothing else. How many
guys handled this without gloves ?</p>
<p><strong>gbaham</strong>: The cleanup man and Lecktor…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had
the oil washed off his fingers. But the others… I could fume it, Will,
but couldn’t guarantee the iodine stains would fade our in the time
you’ve got to get it back.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ninhydran? Boosted with heat?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No. We couldn’t wash it after. I can’t get a
print off this, Will. There isn’t one.</p>
<p><strong>crawpdrd</strong>: Dammit.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: How long do I have?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Twenty minutes max.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The main thing is: how was Lecktor to
reply.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: That’s probably in the part Lecktor tore
out. At the top it says: ‘I hope we can correspond.’ And then the hole
begins . It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then
folded it and pinched most of it away.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He doesn’t have anything to cut with.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Now we can mash it a little.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: You’re so sly, but so am I…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens –
which is what Lecktor has – are transparent to infrared. The Tooth
Fairy’s ballpoint isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: That could be the tip of a ’t. Here and
here. And here.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: At the end is the tail of what could be an
’r.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler.
The stuff about me and Lector? I don’t know any other paper that carried
it…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Personal ads?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: The Chicago office is running through all
the personal ads in the Tattler right now.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: When do they go to press?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: In thirty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Christ!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: After we find Lecktor’s response, we
substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will
actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor’s message. Here’s what he’ll
find, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: ’Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass
my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central. Left luggage
72683.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s a Secret Service letter drop and
stakeout. He shows: we take him. Anything from Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Let’s get to the physical.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: There was no print. I’m here for kicks .</p>
<p><strong>beverly katz</strong>: One whisker. Scale counts and core
size match Hannibal Lecktor’s. So does color. The color’s different than
the Tooth Fairy’s taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and
some dark flecks went to Brian’s end.</p>
<p><strong>brian zellar</strong>: The grains are commercial granulated
cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several
particles of dried blood. Not enough to type.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bowman?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: It’s Snow White toilet paper. National
distribution.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: If there’s any doubt, we matched the indents
of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your
boy… He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this
enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can
make out: ‘six-six-six’. I didn’t spot it until I had this high-contrast
print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Issue the toilet paper tear as a…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: This is Chester here. Who am I talking
to?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Will Graham, Jack Crawford…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: We got an ad order in tonight’s “Tattler”
with ‘six-six-six’ in it. It’s being Telexed to you right now.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Read it.</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: ‘Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.’</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when
he was talking to me…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: ’You’re very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cbawford</strong>: Christ…</p>
<p><strong>chester</strong>: ‘I offer one hundred prayers for your
safety. Find help in john 6:22, 8:16 9:1;Luke l:7, 3:1; Galatians 6:11.
15:2; Acts 3:3; Revelations 18:i; Jonah 6:8… It’s signed: ’Bless you,
6:6:6’</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: … twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at
Langley?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They got shot a Telex. They’re on if now…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: No. The numbers aren’t right for a jailhouse
alphabet code. It’s a book code. And your message has to go out in it,
or he’ll know it’s not Lecktor talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Book code?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: ‘One hundred prayers’ could be the page
number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line
and letter. But what book?</p>
<p><strong>cbawford</strong>: Not the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six
chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 – Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor
wasn’t using a Bible.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the
part Lecktor tore out.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Right . What about sweating Lecktor?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They tried sodium amytal on him three years
ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe
for potato chip dip.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would
know Lecktor has in his cell.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’d know it from articles he’s read about
Lecktor…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took
Polaroids so they could get everything back in place…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor’s
books…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Library of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Twenty-five minutes. We won’t make it in
time.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: We let Lecktor’s message run as is and
decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next
week.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Can we still get Lecktor’s message out of
the paper?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Yes. And I’m leery of running Lecktor’s
message without knowing what it says.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And if we pull it, we lose a week… We only
have two to the next full moon .</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s your call, Will. What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Run it.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to
do something besides write?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We will feel sick for a very long time.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a
James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’d it say?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’ll tell you in a second. Now listen to
me: everything is okay, I’m taking care of it, so stay on the phone when
I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Tell me now.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It says: ’Graham home, 3860 DeSoto
Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It’s your home
address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Get me a plane…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Wait, Will…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Get me a plane!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’ll pick you up in…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I won’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom. ..</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom, someone’s outside. There’s noises …</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Go into your room and lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>trooper</strong>: Are you all right, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Yes. Why? What’s going on</p>
<p><strong>house interior</strong>: Holiday Inn decor.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: …sorry, Molly. I’m sorry this happened to
you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You didn’t do it to me, Will; it’s happened
to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we’ll be okay… He’s after you now,
isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s a precaution… Why don’t you run down to
the bay. They got a swimming float.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I’ll hang around in here. I’ll just be in the
kitchen, Mom…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with
me now?’ He read the Tattler piece, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: He didn’t know you had been in a mental
institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him.
He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin.
We’re going grocery shopping .</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Is there anything I need to know to see about
Mom?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No. You’re very well-protected. No one can
find our where you are.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Barry’s mom had this newspaper. It said you
killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it
true?</p>
<p><strong>gbaham</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I figured I’d ask you…</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: I told my dad before he died, I’d take care
of Mom. And I’ll do it. This guy wants to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Are you gonna kill him?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No. It’s just my job to find him. I was in
the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college
girls and he killed them.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: With a knife.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I found a curly piece of metal in the
clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I
was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In
one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw
it and it was.., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs’
apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was
dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear
kids in there and screaming. I couldn’t wait .</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You went in the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from
behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I kept thinking there must be some way I
could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got
depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a
hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Did the girl die?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: She got all right?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: …after a while.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: And Hobbs died?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Killing somebody feels that bad?</p>
<p><strong>extremely close: graham</strong>: turns and stares at
Kevin:</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Kevin: it’s the ugliest thing in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: What kind of coffee do you like?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: You like that Colombian stuff, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: Mom likes that, too.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s hard to have anything, isn’t it? Rare to
get it, hard to keep it. This is a damn slippery planet.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Slick as hell.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: You remember when we first met? And were
together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold
on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I
asked you what was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I remember.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Do you remember what you said?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. I said this is too good to live…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Time is luck, Will. I know the value of our
days…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Let’s go to bed. I’ll rub your back.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I need to talk to you about Will
Graham.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: What about him?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I need to ask you questions of a
psychological nature.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Remember when you asked for a study on him, I
refused. Same goes for now.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: That was Peterson upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: It was you who did the asking.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He doesn’t think you run mind games on
him.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I wouldn’t presume to try.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You’re never alone in a room with Graham,
are you? You’re smooth about it, but you’re never one-on- one with him.
Why’s that? Do you think he’s psychic?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He’s an eideteker. He has almost total
recall. But I don’t think he’s psychic. What he has it empathy and
projection He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other
points of view that scare and sicken him.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why aren’t you ever alone with him?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Because I’m professionally concerned about
him. And he’d pick up on that. He’s fast. He hates being prodded and
poked. So do I. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs.
Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he
hesitate?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I’ll tell you the events. The psychology’s
none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old
daughter’s throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still
didn’t go down. He had to wade in…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: That’s when it happened?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: No. It happened when Graham went to see
Hobbs’ daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid
artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to
a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him – through the
speaker: ‘Why did you have to kill my daddy?’ That’s when Graham had his
nervous breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What’s the bottom line?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: If he pushes too deep into our boy’s
mind-set, he may destroy himself. What are you planning, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Could he handle a direct contact?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: I don’t recommend it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You don’t recommend what, Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: Crawford has a proposition. I don’t think
it’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he’ll
come for me. So we’re going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give
him a clean shot.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s what you were thinking, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gxaham</strong>: I’ll use Lounds.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Sidney, he doesn’t read the “Sunday Times
literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the”Tattler.” And I want this
over with… Fast.</p>
<p><strong>int. washington apartment - graham + lounds - day</strong>:
Graham leans against a table, his back to a window.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I believe he’s socially maladjusted. Laughed
at by his contemporaries…</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal
Lecktor?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s not as intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What have we missed?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: He may have an unconscious homosexual
conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word ‘fairy.’ Plus
smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds
after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of
interest in Mr, Leeds.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The killer has sexually molested all his
male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the
opposite sex. Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been
the product of an incestuous home life . And probably had sexual
relations with his mother…</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: How long will you stay in Washington?</p>
<p><strong>gbaham</strong>: Until we’ve taken out the Tooth Fairy.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: All right. Let’s shoot the pictures .</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: I want shots with me and Graham together
.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon. You want this to look
real, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Keep the motel sign across the street just
slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can’t look
too obvious.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Asian studies at Langley said the mark you
found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a
lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah-jongg piece.
It means Red Dragon. That mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: …if he’s smart he’ll approach from the
front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: I’m gonna spray your suit jackets. It’ll be
invisible in this light, but you’ll stand out like a zebra for us. They
told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.</p>
<p><strong>gi</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: Good. You’ll load these, Ever fire
them?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Glaser Safety Slugs?</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: … commercially prohibited. Number Twelve
shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in
the target. Expect the recoil. They’re hot loads. Body armor?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Kevlar Second Chance.</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: I hope you have a second chance…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Because he’s gone for the head shot seven
out of eight times’</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let’s walk the route.</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: A “Tattler.”</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: You’ll have to wait until I bust
a bundle.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: I said wait ’til I bust a
bundle. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: Hey. Hey you.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: Yeah, you. Fuckin’ told you…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You told me what?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You told me what?!</p>
<p><strong>newsstand operator</strong>: You got a quarter comin’
back.</p>
<p><strong>a second high angle: graham</strong>: also in GREEN AND
BLACK. Reveal we are:</p>
<p><strong>graham’s</strong>: eyes tighten.</p>
<p><strong>runner’s feet across wet black tarmac</strong>: splash
through shallow puddles.</p>
<p><strong>wide profile: graham</strong>: on the left. The Runner enters
on the right. In SLOW MOTION as they cross, Graham slams him
sideways…</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the right
pocket…!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: God-dammit!!!</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: Arrest dat sucker…!</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: It was a mistake . Sorry we…</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: ‘Sorry’ yo’ mama!!</p>
<p><strong>spurgen</strong>: Hold on! We thought you were someone we’re
trying to catch…</p>
<p><strong>runner</strong>: Hold onto this!! I get dat cannon stuck up
mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?!</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: See you, Freddie.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Are you cold? Would you like a
blanket?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Was I in an accident?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: No, Mr. Lounds. You’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I
hope to God I’m not burned.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there.
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Let me lie down. Listen, I want to call my
office. My God, I’m in a Stryker frame. My back’s broken. Tell me the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: What am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Atoning, Mr. Lounds.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: According to you I’m a sexual failure.
An animal, you said. You know now, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you feel privileged?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: I’m very scared.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you believe God is in attendance
here, Mr. Lounds?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: In a little while I’ll help you
understand.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I’ll be right back. Don’t… go away…</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: I’d do a big story. Anything you want to
say. Describe you any way you want or no description!</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: No. I don’t want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Mr. Lounds, you’re a reporter. You’re
here to titillate your readers. If you don’t open your eyes, I’ll staple
your eyelids to your forehead.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Well: here…I…am…</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Oh my dear God Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Look at the screen. That is William
Blake’s ’The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you
see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes …</p>
<p><strong>dollarhme</strong>: Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her
husband beside her. Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Mrs. Jacobi after her changing. The
Dragon rampant. Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you see?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Please, no.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: ‘No’ what?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Are you a man?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you imply that I’m a queer?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: God, no.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Before me you are a slug in the sun. You
are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant
in the afterbirth. It is your nature to do only one thing correctly:
tremble. Bur fear is not what you owe me. Lounds: you and the others,
YOU OWE ME AWE! We have one more piece of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Didn’t take off the mask. Please,</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Now you will read this into the tape
recorder.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: ‘I have had a great privilege. I have seen
with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before
was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.
’Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to
dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than
to you. ’I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About
his becoming.’</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde’s hand</strong>: turns off the tape recorder.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You did very well. I apologize for the
crude images. Next time I’ll have film stock that doesn’t need lights
.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: You’ll let me go now?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You will tell the truth?</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Absolutely,</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Good . We’ll seal your promise with…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: … with a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>lounds</strong>: Go ’head and kill ’ee, you ’astard! You rot
in ’ell. rot in ’ell!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Can I have one of your cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You haven’t smoked in two years.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I’d like one of your cigarettes, please.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Have you ever omitted telling me. things
before?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Then why?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I wanted it over fast. It felt dirty to not
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Can you quit?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: And… where are things?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Where we’re at is nowhere. We have nothing.
We’re running out of time.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: What will you do?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I have to go back to Birmingham.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Is Crawford going with you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No. I have to be. in there… alone. Maybe
there’s something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: William: you are going to make yourself Sick
or get yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Kevin and I have lived through… with Kevin’s
father… once before… and we can’t…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin’s
grandparents. They haven’t seen him for a while. I’ll come and get you
afterwards…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will�</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Molly. � I love you. And I’m not really
going to be fit to be with for awhile…</p>
<p><strong>int. baltimore airport - graham - day</strong>: On a pay
phone to Dr. Bloom.</p>
<p><strong>gbaham</strong>: Sidney: I don’t understand him. We know he
re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the
act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different.
His ‘becoming’ …but I don’t know what it is he thinks he’s becoming. The
answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That’s what’s
missing for me. why the mirrors?</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: The usual motivation doesn’t apply to him,
nor the way he uses them. I don’t have an answer for you. Listen to me,
my friend: leave this.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And do what? Read about the next family in
the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse ’cause I can’t take my
family home? This ends when I make it over.</p>
<p><strong>bloom</strong>: How are Molly and the boy?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.
Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that…!</p>
<p><strong>valerie leeds</strong>: ’Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I’m
sorry I can’t come to the phone right now …</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m sorry, too…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Excuse me…?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Coffee …</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s just YOU and me now, sport. And I’d
better hurry up and find you. Because I’m losing all this…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Ms. McClain, I’m Francis Dollarhyde. I
came about the low light level infrared film stock.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Put your back against the doer.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Can you give me an idea of the</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can’t
use any lights.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: What’s being photographed?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: The activities of nocturnal animals.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: When do you need it?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: In eight days.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Let me stick this in the black hole.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be
handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code .
It’s still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it’ll do?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: It’ll do fine.</p>
<p><strong>dandridge</strong>: Reba, dear, I’ve got to fly.
Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn’t be too much trouble could you help her
home ?</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I can ‘help’ myself home, Ralph…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I’LL take you.</p>
<p><strong>beba</strong>: No, thanks. I manage very well. I’LL order you
twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Ride with me.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Thanks, but I’ll take the bus. I do it all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride
with me. It would be because I want you to.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: It’s better if I rake your arm.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Come on in. How about a gin and tonic?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Tonic will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: In the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: How did you come to Gateway?</p>
<p><strong>beba</strong>: They had to shape up their employment
practices to keep this defense contract.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You worked out well.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: You know you speak very well, although you
avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute
for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing
impaired children…</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I’ll probably go back to it someday.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>reba.</strong>: If you don’t want to talk. okay. Bur I hope
you will… because I like what you say.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: May I touch your face? I want to know if
you’re smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or
not…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Take my word for it that I’m… smiling
.</p>
<p><strong>rzba</strong>: If I’ve offended you, I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I have to go now.</p>
<p><strong>voice :1</strong>: What’s he doin’? Been in there all day
.</p>
<p><strong>voice :2</strong>: Just sits and stares at the stuff…</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Ready to tell me what kind of ‘outing’ this
is?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: It’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Francis? We’re at the zoo…!</p>
<p><strong>dr. warfield</strong>: In two days we’re going to cap his
tooth. Can you smell him?</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>dr. warfield</strong>: Are you apprehensive? Your protective
and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: No, no! I want to.</p>
<p><strong>dr. warfield</strong>: All right, put your left hand on the
edge of the table and you can explore with your right. I’ll be right
here beside you.</p>
<p><strong>tiger’s great paw</strong>: Reba’s hand enters down its
foreleg. Warfield – with two hands – lifts the great paw and puts it in
her hand. Reba’s hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and
the claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple
muscles of his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>dollarkyde</strong>: I made you a gin and tonic. It’s by the
side of the sofa…</p>
<p><strong>reba’s hand</strong>: moves along the back of the sofa to
Dollarhyde.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Take me upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Let me get them off… it’s torn… I don’t care!
Come on. My God, man. Yes …</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: You’re so sweet, D… Yes…</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Your heart is loud. Feel all of me</p>
<p><strong>ext. dollarhyde house, backyard - door - day</strong>: slams
open. Dollarhyde stops in the door frame.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Is that you. D?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Yes, are you okay…?!</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Good morning… If you show me where things are,
I’ll make us some coffee…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: No! Don’t go back into the house…</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: My sister’s coming by to pick me up for
brunch. Why don’t you come, too?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I have work to do at the plant.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I’ll get my purse.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I’ll get it. Stay right here. You lock
very good in the sun…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Do you want a Coke or something,
Reba?</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I’m fine, Francis.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Fill it up and check the oil,
please.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: You sonofabitch…</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You don’t like it? You know what you can
do about it…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I ought to jam this in your chest, and
drain your heart…</p>
<p><strong>int. hotel room - graham - night</strong>: With Crawford on
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You got the message Lecktor called…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I arranged for him to have a phone. I have
to call him in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: From the lip wound, which happened seven
hours before he got burned, we’ve narrowed it down to those cities
within the seven-hour driving radius that also would’ve caught the
‘Tattler’ early Tuesday morning.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s it narrow down to?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria,
Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s narrow?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: When are you coming back?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: When I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s Will Graham. Is Molly there,
Mr. Swenson?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: Well, how you doin’, Mr. Graham?! You sure
are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer’s dollars,
too, I bet. On the news they said he was a white man. He isn’t really,
is he?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Sure he is. Blond. Probably Scandinavian,
too…</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: You going back down to Florida after?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes. Is Molly there?</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: My grandboy’s been eatin’ a ton of breakfast
every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that
little booger eat. I’11 bet he’s gained ten pounds. Molly’s out in the
motor home…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I know… ‘Out in the good air…’</p>
<p><strong>grampa</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Tell her I called.</p>
<p><strong>gpaham</strong>: This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton arranged
for me to talk with Dr. Lecktor .</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I’ll put you through.</p>
<p><strong>lecxtor</strong>: I wanted to congratulate you for the job
you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you
are. Will.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: You know Lounds’s enlightened me on one
thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have
brought that our in court.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m worn out with you crazy sons-of-
bitches. If you’ve got something to say, Lecktor, say it.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: I want to help you, Will. You’d be more
comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don’t invent our natures,
They’re issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything
else. Why fight it?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Fight what?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: When you were so depressed after you shot
Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn’t the act that got you down.
Didn’t you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good? And why
shouldn’t it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the
time!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: You should, Will. God’s terrific! He
dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last
Wednesday night. Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn.
Don’t you think that felt good? He wouldn’t begrudge you two measly
murders.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Why does it feel good?</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: It feels good because: if you do as God
does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful…</p>
<p><strong>lecktor</strong>: God’s a champ! He got a hundred and sixty
Philippines in one plane crash two months ago… Remember the big
earthquake in Italy last spring…?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I enter. The glass cutter. I lick the
suction cup. The piece of glass I take out is mine. House is mine . I
walk up these stairs. I pass childrens’ toys. The children mean nothing
to me…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I am soundless. I move to the door. I step
into the room…</p>
<p><strong>craham</strong>: I see you there. I breathe in the perfume of
this room. I am in the inner sanctum of a life. You will accept me. Take
me into you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You will be better than anything… anything I
have ever known. As I see me in your eyes.., as I see me accepted there.
Reflected there in mirrors . And you, you are the fuel for my changing…
as this event becomes one more step towards what I am becoming that is
different than what I have ever been before… As I see me, accepted by
you, in the silver mirrors of your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde.</strong>: Shut up. Stop. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I want her! I want her alive… I’m going
to keep her! YOU HEAR</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Reba …</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Francis? Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: The developing room. I need to… see
you.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: I want to see you, too, Francis… Should I come
over?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: No. Reba…?</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Are you okay…?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: I’ll see you later. All right?</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: You’ll come by?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde’s pov: green oldsmobile</strong>: pulls into
Reba’s drive.</p>
<p><strong>dandridge</strong>: There’s something on your face.</p>
<p><strong>int. van - dollarhyde</strong>: stares. Events are
threatening Dollarhyde’s fragile stabil- ity. We don’t want this to be
happening, we don’t want Dandridge to touch her…</p>
<p><strong>int. van - dollarhyde’s face</strong>: Blank .</p>
<p><strong>int. dollarhyde’s van - dollarhyde’s</strong>: hand clutches
the dash.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>dandridge</strong>: Pollen .</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Thanks for the ride.</p>
<p><strong>dandridge</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ralph dandridge</strong>: walks back to his car. We are
TRACKING WITH Dandridge walk- ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and
turns Dandridge. Dollarhyde’s hand clutches the whole of Dandridge’s
lower face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge’s face.
THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde’s nine millimeter. He shot Dandridge
three times in the heart.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: Francis.. .?</p>
<p><strong>red dragon</strong>: It’s not Francis? No. Francis is gone.
Francis is gone forever…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What’s important?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He changes them into beings that accept him…
And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn’t understand
the mirrors before. It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: ‘Changes?’</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s a word. Killing them… His delusion is:
if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has
the power to be accepted all the time. And he would record it somehow.
So he can see himself received over and over again…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How do I know?!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s very careful, very… designed when he
chooses, If we find out how he finds them, then we’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: There’s no connection between the
families.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There has to be.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: There is none! We’ve run it through the
computer a dozen times .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s a very shy boy…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Something Lecktor said.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Let’s admit we struck out this month. The
Gulf Stream’s standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller,
Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an
hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene’ll be very
fresh. ..</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s not over yet.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s a foregone conclusion. For Christ’s
sake, it’s eleven PM. The full moon is tonight.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You wanna watch this or what?!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s why the boltcutter.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out
of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn’t he use it to
go through the basement door?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Because a steel door and deadbolt were
there when they were killed.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You mean Jacobi put it in between when this
film was made and when he was murdered?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He had to.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Donald Jacobi’s eleventh birthday party was
April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they
changed the door. But you can’t see either family’s door from the
street. He wouldn’t know until he got to the house that the padlock
wasn’t there anymore…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: From the alley he couldn’t have seen the
glass in the Leeds’ kitchen door .</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There’s a lattice porch back there, but he
was ready with his glasscutter. So he was either casing far ahead and we
didn’t check back far enough or…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s getting late and…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t talk to me!!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in
the storeroom?</p>
<p><strong>metcalpe</strong>: Yeah. You know what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Have one of the guards down there call
me.</p>
<p><strong>metcalfe</strong>: If the guy’s not asleep…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You knew that was the Jacobis’ cat …</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You brought a boltcutter… ’cause you thought
there was a padlock…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And the Leeds’ dog doesn’t have a collar…
But you know it’s the Leeds’ dog, don’t you, my man?!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: See the woman?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel
her. You can see her again and again. Anytime you want. The doggy
doesn’t have a collar. But you know the Leeds’ dog, don’t you? And you
know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a
boltcutter and every other goddamn thing ’cause…</p>
<p><strong>you’ve seen these fucking films!</strong>: Haven’t you, my
man?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: It’s the guard in the storeroom.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came
in. They’re in the far corner of the room under the windows.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: There’s some film cans in the far corner
of the room underneath one of the windows.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He found them…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What it’s going to say on the Jacobi film
can is the same as it says on the Leeds’ film can: Gateway Lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Is there a label on the Jacobi can that
says what lab processed it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No. It’s Bob’s Photo Store in…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Have him peel the top label back.</p>
<p><strong>crawpord</strong>: See if there’s another label
underneath.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It does, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I want a chopper on the roof in three
minutes. To Meigs Field. At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the
Gulf Stream.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: … You’re scaring me with this.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Some remarkable events have happened in
Birmingham and Atlanta. Do you know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Two groups of people were changed.
Leeds. And Jacobi. The police think they were murdered. Do you know what
they call the being that visited these people? You can say.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: The Tooth…</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Think carefully and answer
correctly.</p>
<p><strong>reba</strong>: It’s Dragon. Dragon… Red Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Francis did a thing for you today so I
couldn’t have you. And he was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>i am the dragon!</strong>: Give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>dollarhyde</strong>: Now you know how the Dragon kills…</p>
<p><strong>int. gulf stream - electrician - night</strong>: finishes
patching together cables.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Try it…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: This is Jack Crawford, FBI. Who am I
speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>fogel</strong>: This is Chester Fogel. I’m the managing
director at Gateway…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: All we know is this man owns a van and he
works at Gateway. We have physical characteristics…</p>
<p><strong>fogel</strong>: We have 516 employees here…</p>
<p><strong>fogel</strong>: Our computers aren’t programmed to retrieve
by physical characteristics. We’d have to re-program and…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Parking permits…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Are your parking permits in the computer?
He drives a van.</p>
<p><strong>fogel</strong>: ‘Employee facilities.’ And we have special
stickers for vans. There’s… let’s see… … about 28, 29 van permits
issued…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Start feeding me names.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Run these names to your DMV for a driver’s
license check. Man we’re after is blond, caucasian, twenty to forty, six
feet tall, 180-225 pounds. First name…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … Alvaro. A.L.V.A.R.O., first name Jose.</p>
<p><strong>lt. fisk</strong>: No. Brown eyes, black hair.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Next …</p>
<p><strong>lt, fisk</strong>: No. 36 years old. Black…</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Could you fasten your seat belts. We’re on
our final approach…</p>
<p><strong>lt. pisk</strong>: …six foot, male caucasian, blond, violet
eves 217 pounds, 38 years old…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Put it through the datafax. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is
that?</p>
<p><strong>lt. fzsk</strong>: From the airport you’re closer. We’ll meet
at the Hock Road off ramp, Highway 94.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Fogel has four more names. He knows two:
both dark hair. Third’s a woman. Fourth’s a handicapped parking
permit…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This is our boy…!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Meet point’s up ahead!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Go on to the house.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Lt. Fisk said…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Go on to the house…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: is staring at Graham’s blankness.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Will�?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: You’re not going to need that. Because
we’re going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis
PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.</p>
<p><strong>st. louis pd driver</strong>: That’s it up ahead…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Cut across the field. Kill your lights.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Get the roadblocks set on Route Three!
There’s an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a
second team’s approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of
the house.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How far away’s the back-up?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’ll cover the back.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Stay in the trees.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There’s somebody in the house, Jack�</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Wait for the back-up! Will?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s happening again, Jack…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … stop it.</p>
<p><strong>window + graham</strong>: – his arms across his face and his
body angled sideways – CRASHES through the glass.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I was out in the garden. Mama came out and
told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Mama was probably asleep.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Not too bad. I’ll be here a few days longer.
I want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I want to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Today’s Wednesday. By Friday I ought to…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Mama has all Kevin’s uncles and aunts coming
down from Cheyenne next week and…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Come home with me.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few
more days…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s this Mama shit?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: It’s what Kevin called her when he was
little…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s the problem, Molly?</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: I came up here after Kevin’s father died .
They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together.
I’ve gotten myself together now, too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Small difference: I’m not dead, yet .</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Will? You could come up here.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They don’t want me up there. Every time they
look at me I remind them… If they thought about it, they’d want you. Bur
all they really want’s the boy. And they’ll take you. But they don’t
want to see me…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Okay. They’re full of shit and they make me
sick…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Maybe we should give it some time…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah. That’s great. A little time. I tell
you what, buckaroo… See you around.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty- three
twenty-eight. Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes .</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Cut out the basketball and go back to the
algebra,</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Are you George Sherman?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Yes. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>grahaei</strong>: My name’s Will Graham. I…</p>
<p><strong>sxerman</strong>: Oh, Jesus… Come in. Honey…!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No, that’s okay… How are you?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: We’re fine. Fine. We’re all well. We’re
okay! That man, Crawford, called and… told me… … how ’bout a drink?
Coffee or something?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No, I’m okay. I just wanted to… … stop by
and…</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: I can’t thank you enough, I..,</p>
<p><strong>sherman family</strong>: standing in awkward places. They ate
nothing special. They are normal human beings living their lives. To
Graham they are very special: they are alive.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I just wanted to stop by and… see you… I
guess. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Let’s forget who said what to whom…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You got a deal…</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: So how’d we do…?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We did okay. Most of them made it…</p>
