<p><strong>peru</strong>: 1936</p>
<p><strong>barranca</strong>: They’re talking about the Curse again!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We don’t need them.</p>
<p><strong>barranca</strong>: I do not carry supplies.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We’ll leave them. Once we’ve got it, we’ll be
able to reach the plane by dusk.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: The Hovitos are near. The poison is still
fresh… three days. They’re following us, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: If they knew we were here, they would have
killed us already.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: So this is where Forrestal cashed in.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: A friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Competitor. He was good, very good.</p>
<p><strong>barranca</strong>: No one has ever come out of there alive.
Why should we put our faith in you?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: No one ever had what we have… partners.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Assuming that pillar there marks the corner
and…</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: I knew nothing! He was crazy! Please!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: What’s wrong? Are you lost?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Forrestal.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: We can go no further.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Now, Satipo, we don’t want to be discouraged
by every little thing.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Try not to touch the vines.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: Se�or, I think we are very close.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear
here.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That’s what scares me.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: There’s plenty of light, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: From that hole!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You wait here.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: If you insist, se�or.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: No time to argue. Throw me the idol, I throw
you the whip.</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: You have no choice! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>satipo</strong>: Adios, amigo!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Adios.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Dr. Jones, you choose the wrong friends.
This time it will cost you.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: And you thought I’d given up.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Too bad they don’t know you like I do,
Belloq.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Yes, too bad. You could warn them… if only
you spoke Hovitos.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Get it going! Get it going!</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: Don’t mind him. That’s Reggie. Wouldn’t hurt a
soul.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I can’t stand snakes.</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: The world’s full of them, you know.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I hate them.</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: Come on now, Sport, show a little of the old
backbone.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Do you think the idol will ever show up?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I don’t know. Just because Belloq had it
doesn’t mean he kept it.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Getting it away from those Indians would be a
neat trick I hope they got him.</p>
<p><strong>teaching assistant</strong>: I couldn’t get the McNabe,
Professor. Someone’s got it checked out ’til next month when classes
start.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That’s all right, Phil. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>teaching assistant</strong>: Will there be anything else?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: No. I’ll see you Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hey, if you don’t like them, I can always
return them.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: No, they’re beautiful. The Museum will buy
them as usual. No questions asked.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Then what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I brought along some people today.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What kind of people?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Government.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Government?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Don’t worry, it’s not about your business.
They’re from the Army.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ve already served.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Army Intelligence. They’re looking for
Abner.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: But you did study under Professor
Ravenwood at the University of Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We haven’t spoken in ten years. I’m afraid we
had a bit of a falling out.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: You know nothing of his whereabouts?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Just rumors. Somewhere in Asia, last I
heard.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Maybe Dr. Jones can make sense of it.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: Well… you must understand, Dr. Jones, this
is all strictly confidential.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: Yesterday, one of our European sections
intercepted a Nazi communiqu� from Cairo to Berlin. We don’t quite know
what to make of it.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: Here it is - “Tanis development
proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra, General Tengtu Hok,
Shanghai. Locate Abner Ravenwood, U.S.”</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Tanis. They must have discovered the lost
ruins.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Tanis. Ain’t that somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Frankly, we’re a little suspicious… An
American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Ah, Ravenwood’s no Nazi.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Then what do they want him for?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: They’re looking for the headpiece to the Staff
of Ra.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: But it says here that’s in China.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Only half of it. Ravenwood had the other
half.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: What would the Nazis want with this - this
Staff of Ra?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I can tell you that. Over the last two years
the Nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world
looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: That’s right. Hitler’s a nut on the
subject. Crazy. He’s obsessed with the occult.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: What is this Staff of Ra, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: It all has to do with the Ark of the Covenant.
The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark from
Jerusalem and took it back to the city of Tanis. A short time later,
Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm that lasted a year. But
before that, the Pharaoh had had the Ark hidden away in a secret chamber
called the Well of the Souls. Which is where the Staff of Ra comes
in.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Now this was rather clever. The Staff was
really just a big stick - oh, I don’t know, say like this - no one
really knows for sure. Any way, it was capped by an elaborate headpiece
with a carving of the sun at the top. What you had to do was take the
Staff to a special map room in Tanis - it had the whole city laid out in
miniature on the floor. When you placed the Staff in a certain spot in
this room, at a certain time of day, the sun would shine through a hole
here in the headpiece and then send a beam of light down here - to the
map - giving you the location of the Well of the Souls…</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: …where the Ark of the Covenant was
kept.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Which is probably what the Nazis are
after.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: What’s this Ark look like?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Look like? Why, it’s right here…</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Good God!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Yes. That’s what the Hebrews thought.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: What’s that supposed to be coming out of
there?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Who knows… lightning… fire… the power of
God.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: I’m beginning to understand Hitler’s interest
in this thing.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Oh yes. The Bible tells of it leveling
mountains and wasting entire regions. Moses promised that when the Ark
was with you, “your enemies will be scattered and your foes fell before
you”. An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Oh, there’s one other thing that Hitler
undoubtably believes about the Ark… It’s said that the Lost Ark will be
recovered at the time of the coming of the True Messiah.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: Dr. Jones, you’ve been very helpful. I
hope we can call on you again if we have questions.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Most certainly.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’ve got to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: This isn’t really a good time.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Indy, it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: All right. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ll be in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: They want you to go for it. And they’ll
pay.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Good work, Marcus. I had a feeling this would
happen. And, of course, the Museum gets the Ark when we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Okay, here’s the way it’s gonna be. First,
I’ll high-tail it to Shanghai and get the piece from General Hok. Then I
think I know where I can find Ravenwood. If only I can get -</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: General Hok’s a tough customer. They don’t
call him the Wild Boar for nothing. And he’s tied in with the
Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ll worry about that when the time comes. My
only hope is to find the Well of the Souls before the Nazis do.</p>
<p><strong>kehoe</strong>: Buzz Kehoe, Army Intelligence. You’ve met
Bang Chow.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What’s the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>kehoe</strong>: Some German agents got here two hours ago.
Luckily, Bang was able to have them detained at Customs. We’ll have to
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>kehoe</strong>: Jesus! Are you all right!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Great. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>kehoe</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ve got to get to Nepal.</p>
<p><strong>sherpa</strong>: Gmoiska! Shurga rintoik!</p>
<p><strong>climber</strong>: Aye! That’ll be your last word.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That does it! I’ve been patient with you
no-goods long enough. I’m not open at 2 o’clock for myself, you know.
It’s all for you. And how do you repay me: Trouble and noise and blood
on my floor! I won’t have it. Everybody out! Out! Out! We’re closed.
Closed! Do your killing outside! And don’t leave any bodies on the
porch!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Hey you, deaf one! I said out of my place. I
don’t mean next Easter, I mean now -</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hello, Marion.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Nice to see you, too.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Get up and get out.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Take it easy. I’m looking for your father.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Well you’re two years too late.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Go home, Mahdlo. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Avalanche. Up there. He was digging. What
else? He spent his whole life digging. Dragging me all over this rotten
earth. For what?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Do you find him?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Hell no. He’s buried where he was working.
Probably preserved real good, too. In the snow.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Not a bad way to go. Doing what he loved.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t give me that stuff! What do you know?
I’m the one that was left in a bad way. He didn’t have a penny. Guess
how I lived, Mister Jones. I worked here. And I wasn’t the bartender.
Finally the guy that owned the joint went crazy. Snow crazy. They took
his away screaming. As they dragged him out, he said the place was all
mine for life.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Can you imagine a more evil curse? So far,
it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Why not leave? Go back to the States.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll go back. I’ll get there. Not that
there’s a soul there who knows my name or cares. But I’ll go. And when I
do, they’ll know me. ’Cause I’m going to go back in style. With money. A
goddamn lady!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Where you gonna get it?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: If I knew that, you think I’d still be
running this dive?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’ll tell you something Indy. I’ve learned
to hate you in the last ten years. But somehow, no matter how much I
hated you, I always knew that someday you’d come through that door. I
never doubted that. Something made is inevitable. Why are you here… now…
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I need one of the pieces your father
collected.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You son-of-a-bitch! You know what you did to
me, to my life? This is your handiwork.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I never meant to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I was a child!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You knew what you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I was in love.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I guess that depends on your definition.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It was wrong. You knew it.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Look, I did what I did. I don’t expect you to
be happy about it. But maybe we can do each other some good.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why start now?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Shut up and listen for a second. I want that
piece your father had. I’ve got money.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Enough to get you back to the States. Where
are his things?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Gone. I sold it all. It was all junk. The
junk he wasted his life on.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You look disappointed. I like that. How’s it
feel?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Seltzer.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Real man’s drink. Me, I like scotch. And I
like bourbon. And vodka and gin. I’m not much for brandy. I’m off
that.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You’re a tough broad now, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: It’s no act, pal. This ain’t
Schenectady.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I can only say I’m sorry so many times.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You really have money? You don’t look rich.
I may be able to locate some of his things. I know who’s got them. What
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: A bronze piece, about this size. In the shape
of the sun. Probably broken off at the bottom. Has a little hole in it,
off-center. Does that sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Do you know where it is?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Maybe. How much?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Three thousand. American.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’ll get me back, but not in style. This
doodad must be pretty important.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I knew it would happen eventually. I knew
it. Something had to go my way. I’ve got to think this out. I’m used to
bargaining with yaks.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Okay, five thousand. That’s all I can give you
now. I can get you more when you land in the States.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You word, huh? Just like you said you’d be
back last time? That was your word too.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’m back, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Because I said so, that’s why. It’s about
time I called the shots in this relationship.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Wait a minute. Leave the five thousand here.
You want trust, give some. I want to smell your money.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I trust you.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ve heard that.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Hold it. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Bossy, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s right. Give me a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Get out of my place.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Good evening, Fraulein.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The bar’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: We are not thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Ah, the man is nefarious. I hope for your
sake he has not yet acquired it.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why, are you willing to offer more?</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Almost certainly. Do you still have it?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No. But I know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How ’bout a drink for you and your men?</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: We will stick to the business at hand,
Fraulein.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Fine. Why don’t you come back tomorrow when
Jones is here and we’ll have an auction?</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: I’m afraid an auction is not possible. Your
fire is dying here, Fraulein. Why don’t you tell us where the piece is
right now?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Listen, Herr Mac, I don’t know who you’re
used to dealing with, but no one tells me what to do in my place.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Americans! You’re all alike. Fraulein
Ravenwood. I’ll show you want I’m used to.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Wait! I can be reasonable -</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: That time is passed.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You don’t need that. I’ll tell you
everything!</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Yes, I know you will.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Shoot them both!</p>
<p><strong>second nazi</strong>: He’s our man!</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: Do as I say!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Not without that piece you want!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: It’s here?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Forget it! I want you out of here. Now!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You burned down my place!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I owe you plenty!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: You owe me plenty!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You’re something!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I am something. And I’ll tell you exactly
what -</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m your partner!</p>
<p><strong>fayah</strong>: Silence! Why do you forget yourselves?</p>
<p><strong>fayah</strong>: What is this? Who brought this animal in?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why, thank you. I like you too.</p>
<p><strong>fayah</strong>: Then it shall be welcome in our house.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Oh, no! You don’t have to have it around if
you don’t want it -</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: All of Allah’s creatures are welcome here.
You please us by letting us please you.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah.
They couldn’t have an excavation in the desert without the best digger
in Egypt.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: All Arabs look alike to them, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Tell me about the map room at Tanis.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: We found it three days ago. I broke through
myself.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Those Nazis are moving awfully fast.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: The Frenchman is helping them.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Belloq. So he got away from the Indians. This
is going to be more interesting that I thought.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: I’m afraid this has put the Germans close to
finding the Well of the Souls.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Even Belloq won’t be able to find it without
that. Can you make anything of those markings? They’re nothing I’m
familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: But I know someone who might. You can go to
see him tomorrow. Indy… something bothers me.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What is it, my friend?</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: It is the Ark. If it is there, at Tanis… It
is not something man was meant to disturb… Death has always surrounded
it. It is not of this earth.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Do you really need that monkey?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I’m surprised at you, Indy. Talking that way
about our baby. He’s got your looks, too.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: And your brains.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Hey! Hey!… where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: He’ll be OK. Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Run! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Go, dammit! Go!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Indy-y-y-y!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Marion.</p>
<p><strong>arab bartender</strong>: The gentleman in the corner sent it.
He would like you to join him.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Too bad. I’m drinking alone.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Belloq.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Good evening, Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I ought to kill you right now.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: It was not I who brought the girl into this
dirty business.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Sit down, please, before you fall down. We
can behave as civilized people. I’m afraid it will be your last
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Not a very private place for a murder.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: These Arabs will not interfere in the white
man’s business. They do not care if we kill each other off. Terribly
difficult finding a decent vintage here. You were quite vigorous in
Shanghai. Unfortunately, our friend the Wild Boar had taken the
precaution of making several copies of the piece.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: How odd that is should end this way for us,
after so many… stimulating encounters. I almost regret it. Where shall I
find a new adversary so close to my own level?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Try the local sewer.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: I know you despise me. We always hate in
others that which we most fear in ourselves. And you and I are very much
alike.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Now you’re getting nasty.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: We have always done the same kind of work.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend. I am a shadowy
reflection of you. But it would have taken only a nudge to make you the
same as me, to push you out of the light.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: You know it to be true! How nice. And how
ironic the timing.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Do you realize what the Ark is? It’s a
transmitter. A radio for talking to God! And now it is within my
grasp.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What about your boss, der Fuhrer? I thought he
was waiting to take possession.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: When the time is right. When I am finished
with it.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I hope your friends are patient. Dangerous
work, Belloq.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Yes. Very. You may consider yourself
fortunate that your involvement concludes here.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Tell me, did you get away with the idol?</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: I was lucky to get away with my life. The
Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded about the whole matter.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You know, if it’s God you want to talk to,
maybe I can arrange it.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: You have not changed. But, please, do not
reach for your weapon until you are ready to die.</p>
<p><strong>little son</strong>: Uncle Indy, we have been looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>little daughter</strong>: Come home now, Uncle. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Yes. Yes, I’ll come now.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Next time, Indiana Jones, it will take more
than children to save you.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: I thought we would find you there. Better
than the United States Marines, eh?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Thanks you. Marion’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: Yes, I know. I am sorry. More reason than
ever to beat the bastards. Life goes on, Indy. There is the proof.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: I have much to tell you, Indy.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: And they made the calculation in the map
room?</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: This morning. Belloq and the boss German,
Shliemann. When they came out of the map room, we were given a new spot
in which to dig… out away from the camp.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: The Well of the Souls.</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Come. Look.</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: This is a warning… not to disturb the Ark of
the Covenant.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Just want I need.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: How ’bout the height of the staff? Did Belloq
get it off of there?</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Yes… it is here.</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: It says it is… ten jamirs high…</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: About seventy-five inches.</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: Wait! I am not finished…</p>
<p><strong>amir</strong>: “And one jamir to honor the Hebrew God whose
Ark this is.”</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You said their top section was blank. Are you
absolutely sure?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Belloq’s staff is seven and a half inches
short. They’re digging in the wrong spot!</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: A home run, my friend, grand slam! We have a
saying - “A little luck is better than much smartness.” Indy, pardner,
you are very lucky fellow.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: Bad dates.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: My God! They aren’t kidding!</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: There! That is the map room!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What time does the sun hit the map?</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: Just after eight.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We haven’t got much time. Where are the
Germans digging for the Well of the Souls?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Okay. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jeep german</strong>: Hey! You, the skinny one!</p>
<p><strong>jeep german</strong>: Yes, you. What are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>jeep german</strong>: Well bring that rope over here, you
cur.</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: Bring us some of that!</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: Now, idiot!</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: Water. Bring us water.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Sallah. Sallah!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Sallah!</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: Hey, you! More water over here!</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: Why aren’t you at the digs? Come
here!</p>
<p><strong>hungry german</strong>: No, dummkopf, I said come!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I though you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: They were throwing me around like a rag
doll.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: They must have switched baskets. Thank god for
that! Bless those bastards. Have they hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No. Not since I got here. They just asked
about you - what you knew. The Frenchman’s got the hot’s for me. I’ve
been playing that along. Oh, Indy, get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I have to leave you here for a little while. I
know where the Ark is. If I take you out of here they’ll start combing
the place for us.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Cut me loose!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I said get me out of -</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Look, you don’t know how glad I am to see you.
And I don’t like doing this. But the whole thing will be shot if you
don’t just sit here quietly. They haven’t hurt you in the last
twenty-four hours, they aren’t going to start now. I’ll be back to get
you in no time.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: I cautioned you about being premature with
that communiqu� to Berlin. Archeology is not an exact science. If does
not adhere to time schedules.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: The Fuhrer is not a patient man. He
demands constant reports and he expects progress. You led me to believe
-</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Nothing. I have made no promises. I said
only that it looked very favorable. Perhaps the Ark will still be found
in an adjoining chamber. Based on the information in our possession, my
calculations were correct. Perhaps some bit of evidence still eludes us.
Perhaps</p>
<p><strong>gobler</strong>: Perhaps the girl can help us.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: My feeling exactly. She was in possession
of the original piece for years. She may know much. If properly
motivated…</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: I tell you, she knows nothing useful.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: I’m surprised to find you squeamish. That
is not your reputation. But it needn’t concern you. I have the perfect
man for this kind of work.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: The Ark must be in that stone case. What’s
that gray stuff all over the floor -</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Why snakes? Why did it have to be snakes?
Anything else.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: Asps. Very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Lots of torches. And oil. I want a landing
strip down there.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Believe me, you made a mistake. If you would
just give me something to placate them. Some bit of information.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I swear to you, I know nothing more. I have
no loyalty to Jones. He’s brought me only trouble.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: I cannot control them.</p>
<p><strong>belzig</strong>: We meet again, Fraulein.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Don’t touch it! Never touch it!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hurry up! Why did it have to be snakes?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What the -</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in
such a nasty place?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Why don’t you fellows come down here? I’ll
show you.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: No thank you, my friend. I think we are all
very comfortable up here.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: After all these years, it is most
considerate of you to aid me in this way.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: I’m afraid we must be going now,
Dr. Jones. Our prize is awaited in Berlin. But I do not wish to leave
you down in that awful place… …all alone.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Don’t put me down!</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: The girl was mine!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: She is of no use to us. Only our mission
for the Fuhrer matters.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: I wonder sometimes, Monsieur, if you have
that clearly in mind.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Goodbye, mademoiselle. Indiana Jones…
adieu!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Don’t panic. There’s plenty of time for that
later. Wave that at anything that slithers.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Just watch the floor.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Whatever you’re doing, do it faster.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Stay here!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute. We’re going through
this wall.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Just keep your eyes open and get ready to run.
No matter what happens to me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Indy! Where are you?! Please Lord!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: The snakes… are they here?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I guess not. I think I’d be dead.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Do you know where you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Thank god. Where?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Out.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Don’t do that. It scares me.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>gobler</strong>: Get is gassed immediately! It has an
important cargo to take out!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: When the Ark gets loaded, we’re already going
to be on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Get out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Stay with the Ark!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Sabotage!</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: We must get the Ark away from this place
immediately!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Have it put on the truck. We’ll fly out
of Cairo.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: And Gobler - I want plenty of
protection.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: Holy smoke, my friends! I am so pleased you
are not dead.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Us too.</p>
<p><strong>sallah</strong>: The Ark! They’re taking it on a truck to
Cairo.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You two get back to Cairo quick and get us
transportation to England - a plane, a ship, anything.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’m going to get that truck. I’ll meet you at
Omar’s. Be ready for me.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: How are you going to get that truck?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I don’t know. I’m making this up as I go.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: If anything happens to that Ark, we’re
all dead men ! The Fuhrer will see to it!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I have a feeling I’m not the first woman to
travel with these pirates. There’s a whole wardrobe in there.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: It’s lovely.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: I feel like a virgin bride in this.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That’s what you look like.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: There are some things you can recapture in
this life, but that isn’t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What would you like to recapture?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Nothing. That is the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Did I ever say I was sorry I burned down your
tavern?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No. Then again, I burned up that plane.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: And you saved mine.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Seems things have worked out kind of even.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: That’s the way I like them.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Maybe we should consider all past accounts
closed.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: No. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: The engines have shut down.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: I’m going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>messenger pirate</strong>: Mister Jones! The Captain he say
-</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>katanga</strong>: You have most important friends.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>katanga</strong>: I sent my man for you. You and the girl
must disappear. We have a place in the hold. Go, my friend!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Take it aboard the Wurrfler!</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: And be very careful!</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: What about Jones?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Not a trace yet, sir!</p>
<p><strong>katanga</strong>: Jones is dead.</p>
<p><strong>katanga</strong>: We killed him. He was of no use to us. The
girl, however, has certain value where we are headed. She will bring a
very good price. If that cargo you have taken was your goal, then go in
peace with it. But leave us the girl. It will reduce our loss on this
trip.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Savage. You are not in a position to ask
for anything. We will take what we wish and then decide whether or not
to blow your ship from the water.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: That girl goes with me. It will be part of
my compensation. I’m sure the Fuhrer would approve.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: If she fails to please me, you can do with
her as you wish.</p>
<p><strong>the wurrfler’s captain</strong>: Colonel Shliemann, all
torpedoes are loaded.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: What do you think, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>the wurrfler’s captain</strong>: I think not, Colonel.
Nothing is to be gained. We are not at war.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: …yet. Let the vermin live. We must be on
our way.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>tall captain</strong>: The tents have been arranged in
accordance with your radioed instructions, sir.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Good. We must take the Ark there now.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: I am uncomfortable with the thought of
this - Jewish ritual. Are you sure it’s necessary?</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Let me ask you this - Would you be more
comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin - for the Fuhrer - and finding out
only then if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside? Knowing, only
then, whether you have accomplished your mission and obtained the one,
true Ark?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hold it. One move from anybody and I blow that
box back to Moses.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Jones, your persistence surprises even me.
You are going to give mercenaries a bad name.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: What about you? Talked to God yet? Where’s the
girl?</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Doctor Jones, surely you don’t think you
can escape from this base.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That depends on how reasonable we’re all
willing to be. All I want is the girl. We’ll keep possession of the Ark
only till we’ve got safe transport to England. Then it’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: If we refuse?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Then the Ark and some of us are going up in a
big bang. I don’t think Hitler would like that a bit. Now I don’t want
to talk about this anymore. Show me that girl in five seconds or -</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Jones, this is the second time I have
seen you looking very foolish.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: It’s a bad habit. I’m trying to break it.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: I’ll help you. This time I’ll kill you
myself.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: No! Not in the presence of the Ark! Take him
outside.</p>
<p><strong>belloq</strong>: Indiana Jones, I salute you. I am even a
little sorry you will miss this moment.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Thanks. If you talk to Him, tell Him I’m on my
way up.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Marion! Marion, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Oh, Indy! Thank god you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Glad I could make it.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: What about the Ark?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Are you game?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Hell yes! We’ve made it this far.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Okay. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t touch it. Let’s put it
on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We’ll go down that side. Shoot anyone who
looks at us crosseyed.</p>
<p><strong>shliemann</strong>: Stop them! Kill them!</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We must cover the drums! Protect them from
the bullets!</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Slow it down!</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: You’ve done your country a great
service.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: And we trust you found the settlement
satisfactory?</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Quite.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Good, good. Then I guess that about does
it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: When can we have the Ark?</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: I thought we answered that. It’s someplace
very safe -</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: That’s a powerful force. Research should be
done -</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Oh, it will be, Dr. Jones, I assure you. We
have top men working on it right now.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: Top men.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: We may be able to help.</p>
<p><strong>eaton</strong>: We appreciate that. And we won’t hesitate to
call on you.</p>
<p><strong>musgrove</strong>: Thank you all. Thank you again.</p>
<p><strong>marion</strong>: Well they aren’t going to tell you, so why
don’t you just forget it. I’d think you’d had enough of that damn Ark.
Just put your mind on something else.</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: Yeah, like what?</p>
<p><strong>indy</strong>: It’s not the Ark… but it’ll have to do.</p>
