<h1 id="man-on-the-moon">man-on-the-moon</h1>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hallo. I am Andy. Welcoom to my movie. I hoped
the story of my life would be nice…but it turned out terrible! It is all
LIES! Tings are mixed up… real people I knew play different people. WHAT
A MESS! So I broke into Universal and cut out the junk. Now it’s much
shorter. In fact, this is the end of the movie. So tanks for comink!
Bye-bye!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay! Just my friends are left. I wanted to
get rid of those other people… they would have laughed in the wrong
places. I was only kidding about the movie… it’s actually PRETTY GOOD!
It shows everything… from me as a little boy until my death – Oops!! I
wasn’t supposed to talk about that! Oh. Eh, uh, we better just begin. It
starts back in Great Neck, Long Island…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, yes. I remember it well…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: That’s my boy! Good swingin’, kiddo. Hey –
Michael… where’s your brother?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: He’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Is he in his room?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Of course he’s in his room. All his
“friends” are in there.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But professor, why are the monsters growing so
big?</p>
<p>****: It’s something in the jungle water. I need to crack the secret
code.</p>
<p>****: Maybe I should talk to the natives. Shoom boom boo ba! Shoom
boom boo ba –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Andy!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Andy, this has to stop. Our house isn’t a
television station. There is not a camera in that wall.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But I’ve got a sports show. Championship
wrestling, at five.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: You know that’s not what I meant! Look, I’m
gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you
GOTTA have an audience!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: B-but I have them.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: No! That is NOT an audience! That is
PLASTER! An audience is people made of flesh! They – live and breathe!
Got it?!</p>
<p>****: And now, boys and girls! It’s time for… TV Fun House!</p>
<p>****: Hi, everybody! Are you ready for a singalong? I’ll say the
animal, and you make his sound! Okay…? Okay! “Oh, the cow goes………”</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Moo.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “And the dog goes……”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “And the cat says……”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “And the bird says…”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “And the lion goes…”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “And that’s the way it goes!” Thank you.
Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies
and Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow…?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Eh, I dunno… Andy. I’m… thinkin’ of letting
you go…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re firing me?? You don’t even pay me!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Look – I don’t wanna seem insulting. But…
your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs… puppets… playing records…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What do you want? “Take my wife, please”??</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic.
Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t swear. I – I don’t do what everyone
else does!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well, everyone else gets this place
cookin’! Pal, it’s hard for me to move the booze when you’re singin’
“Pop Goes The Weasel.”</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Give us your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I – doo not unterstand!!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Give us your money!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What?? What mooney? Abu daboo! I do not have
mooney!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: What’s in the case?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: NO! Eeet, eet is just perzonal trifles from my
homeland –</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: Shut up! Gimme that thing!</p>
<p><strong>thug #1</strong>: Goddamn immigrants!</p>
<p><strong>thug #2</strong>: This guy’s pathetic. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tank you veddy much…!</p>
<p><strong>wiseass comic</strong>: So I’m getting my mother-in-law a
special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral! The mortician asked me
if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated. I said, “Make it all
three! I’m not takin’ any chances!” Thank you. Good night! The comic
waves and exits. APPLAUSE. George politely claps. A PIANO PLAYER jumps
in with an upbeat show tune.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Now? Now…? Tank you veddy much. I am very
happy to be here. I tink – this is a very beautiful place. But one ting
I do not like is too much traffic. Tonight I had to come from, eh, and
the freeway, it was so much traffic. It took me an hour and a half to
get here!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p>****: “Warden threw a party In the county jail! Prison band was there
And they BEGAN to WAIL!”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Pst. What’s the story with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: I think he’s Lithuanian. None of us can
understand him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He does a hell of an Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, I really enjoyed your set.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tank you veddy much.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So I understand you’re from Lithuania?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No. Caspiar.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Caspiar? I haven’t heard of that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.
It sunk.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Hm. I’m uh, sorry. Well, look, I’m
probably out of my mind – but I think you’re very interesting. If you
ever need representation… we should talk.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Mr. Shapiro, it’s an honor!!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Caspiar, huh?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You see, I want to be the biggest star in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: People love… comedians.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m not a comedian. I have no talent. I’m a
song-and-dance man.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You show a lot of promise… but… my concern
is I don’t know where to book you. You’re not a stand-up… your act
doesn’t exactly translate to films… help me… where do you see
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ve always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, ha-ha. That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: See, I don’t want easy laughs.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re insane. But – you might also be
brilliant. Alright, Andy… let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine
gig. You’ll be on the road… get some exposure…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Tony Clifton on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: He says he’s an associate of Andy
Kaufman’s.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Sammy, think about it. I gotta go.
Hello? George Shapiro here.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Uh, yeah. Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Er, yes. Speaking.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: “Speaking”! Reeking, seeking,
creaking… Freaking!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Can I help you with something?</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Yeah! You stay away from that Andy
Kaufman, if you know what’s good for you!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: You – you know damn straight who it
is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer.
Ear.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look… I don’t know what your problem is…</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Kaufman’s a lying bastard! If you sign
him, I’ll RUIN YOU!</p>
<p><strong>little wendy</strong>: Now, while continuing your deep
breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and
alert.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Do any thoughts come…?</p>
<p><strong>student #1</strong>: My mind is clear. I feel great.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Good…</p>
<p><strong>student #2</strong>: All the tension is gone from my
body.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart
is radiating with pure energy.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: You always had a good heart. But I’m proud of
the progress you’ve made in your discipline.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes. TM got me focused. In fact, my manager
got me a TV gig! It’s just some new show with no budget, but I’m still
excited.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Are you at peace with your family?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Um, yes. I haven’t fought with them, since I
started here.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Goals are important.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I’m
meditating three hours a day. It’s the center of my life…</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: We are all impressed.</p>
<p><strong>little wendy</strong>: Okay. Anyone else –?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, wait! I have a question. Is there… is
there a secret to being funny?</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Yes. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I still can’t believe my brother’s gonna be
on TV…!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I hope he doesn’t get nervous.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: What’s the difference? This thing’s on in
the middle of the night – no one’s even gonna see it.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now,
as a special treat on our first show… musical guest ANDY</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: What’s happening to him?</p>
<p><strong>mighty mouse theme</strong>: “Although we are in danger, We
never despair, Because we know where there is danger He is there!”</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: Oh my God, he’s doing nothing. It’s
dead air…!</p>
<p><strong>mighty mouse theme</strong>: “We’re not worrying at all.
We’re just listening for his call…” Then SUDDENLY – Andy comes to life
and triumphantly LIP</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy, c’mon IN! Thanks for flyin’ out
here!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The stewardess let me keep my headphones.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s… terrific! But I got something
better. This is BIG… You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably
lucrative opportunity to star on… a</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sitcom…?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And this is a CLASS ACT! It’s the guys who
did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi
stand! And you’re gonna be the Fonzie!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m – Fonzie?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout
character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their
lunchboxes!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: George, I hate sitcoms.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: HANG ON, you ain’t heard the best part! ABC
has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into –
“Latka,” a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: “No”? “No” to which part??</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No to the whole thing. None of it sounds
good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy… this is every comedian’s dream.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I told you, I’m not a comedian. And sitcoms
are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned
laughter.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: B-but, this is classy… they did Bob
Newha–</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m not interested. I want to create my own
material.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I refuse.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I’ve been in this
business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this
opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. Fine, I’ll do it. But I have a few
terms.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Of course! That’s what negotiations are
for.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Writing down my terms.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Are you makin’ fun of me –? This is
RIDICULOUS!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Those are my terms.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: They’re IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean – “two
guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton”??! Who is this TONY
CLIFTON?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He’s a Vegas entertainer. I used to do
impressions of him. We sorta… got in a fight over that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This Clifton called me up. He’s a loon! He
HATES you!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Nah, he just talks tough. But I owe him
one.</p>
<p>****: Heyyyyyy!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the
episodes. Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation
prior to filming. Mr. Kaufman won’t rehearse. Mr. Kaufman gets his own
network Special.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tony Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>network guy #1</strong>: Who is he?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>network guy #2</strong>: Couldn’t Kaufman ask for more money,
like everyone else?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hi George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton… is he
performing anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Of course. But only on Monday nights.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s alright. Where…?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now, Mama Roma’s is proud to present
International Singing Sensation… a man who has sold more records than
Elvis and the Beatles combined…</p>
<p><strong>angry guy</strong>: Goddamn, I paid five dollars for
this.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now! A man who needs no introduction…
TONY CLIFTON!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Heh-heh. How ya all doin’?</p>
<p><strong>angry guy</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: “Volare! Whoa, whoa. Cantare, Whoa
whoa whoa whoa.”</p>
<p>****: How’s that pasta carbonara?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Okay! So, you havin’ a good time,
sir?!</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: Bob.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: this is enormously “Bob”? BOB! Bob bob
bob. Bob what?</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: Bob Gorsky.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: “Gorsky”? What is that, Polish?</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Are you tryin’ to do some of that
Polack humor? Well if that’s so, you can just get the hell out of this
restaurant!</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: It’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: SHUT UP! I hate them Polish jokes!</p>
<p><strong>sad sack</strong>: A – a tourist.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: See, that’s EXACTLY what I’m talkin’
about! Here! I’LL give you a little humor!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And YOU. I wanna see you backstage!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, I’m here. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I… I-I don’t understand this act.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s good old-fashioned entertainment.
Everyone loves a villain.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah? Well tell that to the poor schlub who
you humiliated!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Hey Andy, good show.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have
been buddies for years.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: That was a really hot house!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So your name’s not Gorsky.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Don’t believe everything you hear.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: This has to stay in the room… but here’s the
thing: Andy is Tony. And Tony is Andy! They’ll deny it up and down, but
I swear to God, they’re the same person! It’s smart business! You’ll get
two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy… THEY SAID YES! They agreed to it all!
They thought your terms were a shining example of your “irreverent wit”
– and precisely why they want you! You’re getting EVERYTHING!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well thank you very much…!</p>
<p><strong>tony danza</strong>: Man, this is bullshit! Where’s Kaufman?
Why isn’t he here??</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You’ll see him on Friday when we shoot. Now run
the lines with Rodney.</p>
<p><strong>judd hirsch</strong>: I’m taking bets we do the show with the
stand-in.</p>
<p><strong>marilu henner</strong>: No, I hear Andy arrived. Rumor is
he’s locked inside his dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m gonna quit.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: What?!?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Each show is worse than the next.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you
every week!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So? What do they know?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Absolutely nothing! That’s the beauty! It’s
credibility. You make them love you… and then later, on your special,
you’ll screw with their heads!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: I don’t care! Travolta signed a contract,
he’s a Sweathog for life!… Oh yeah? Just try to sue us.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Sir, they’re having a problem down on the
Kaufman Special. They say he’s not following the… technical
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: “Technical”???</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s my show! Now make it roll!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Andy, I hear fabulous things about the
Special… Eh, I understand we’ve hit a teeny speedbump?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess with
the horizontal hold! He wants the picture to roll!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And now… in her television debut, the
incredible Chubby Rosalie!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’ll be great. The viewer will think their TV
is broken. They’ll get out of their chair, they’ll twist the knobs,
they’ll hit the TV, but they won’t be able to fix it!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Andy… we don’t want the viewer to get out
of their chair. They might change the channel.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But it’s funny! It’s a practical joke. They’ll
get frustrated!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Andy… uhh… this network has a long-standing
policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But it’s only for thirty seconds!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Twenty!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>studio page</strong>: Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: … Yes, it’s Andy Kaufman!… Really! …I got your
fan letter… So you like the show? Your letter said I was silly. Did you
think I was too silly?… Oh good. I’m glad.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: … so after I finish junior college, I’ll go to
work for my dad’s accounting firm. Unless, I decide to live with my
friend Valerie, but she wants to move to Anaheim, and I don’t want to do
that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Excuse me – ?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you wanna wrestle? It’s a good way of
breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two
people together.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: What are you talking about?! We just met an
hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No no no, it’s not sex! I mean – it can lead
to sex… but really, it’s just wrestling.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I don’t wanna talk about it!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I mean – uh – the colors in the sky are so
vibrant. I love this time of day.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ve never understood that. It’s just… getting
dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don’t we fill the car with gas, drive to
Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I think I wanna go home.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You know… I was once in your gallery. I was
just sitting there and I wanted to touch you. I was kind of depressed
because I could see what everyone was like, and I was wondering if, now,
maybe I could… touch you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Howdy, I’ve been watching you ever since I was
a little boy… You’re the first friend from television I ever had. I
always wanted to meet you… and now …I finally am.</p>
<p><strong>exec #2</strong>: This is NOT funny.</p>
<p><strong>exec #3</strong>: “Artsy Fartsy shit”…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No… eh, the Special isn’t all like this…
just wait… it will be hysterical.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Christ! We’re the Number One Network –
can’t we afford decent TVs?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, um… it’s part of the snow.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this
program!!</p>
<p><strong>blue collar guy 1</strong>: Excuse me, could I please have
more coffee?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah, yeah, in a sec’. That was decaf,
right?</p>
<p><strong>blue collar guy 1</strong>: You know, you look just like Andy
Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah, I get that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>blue collar guy 2</strong>: I’m telling you, it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>blue collar guy 1</strong>: You wanna bet?? If that was him,
he wouldn’t be workin’ here, pouring my coffee!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey! Could you clear this table and bring me
a piece of poundcake?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: NO! I’d rather work here, than at ABC. There’s
no lying in a restaurant. They don’t promise you a job as a cashier,
then suddenly make you a frycook!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, I’m sorry. They’re assholes! But we
work in a creative business. You can’t predict what people are gonna
like –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have
my own Special!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Tell you what. I’ll book you on some
concerts, and meanwhile, we’ll show the Special around… see if somebody
wants to buy it –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah, we can have a garage sale. “Hey look, I
got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You signed for five years – So four years,
seven months.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay… I’ll go back. But just let them know,
first they ain’t gettin’ Latka. They’re gettin’ Tony!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Thank you. It’s great to be here. We’re going
to have a very nice time. We’ll sing some songs –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Uh, we’ll play with puppets –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Excuse me one moment.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Give me the book.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: No! Andy, don’t do it –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They’re asking for it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Since you’re such a special audience… I’m
going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me.</p>
<p>****: I’m actually British. I was raised in London and educated at
Oxford. And though I dabble in clowning, I do find it so boorish. So…
American. I prefer the fine arts. Henceforth, tonight, I’d like to grace
you with a reading of the greatest novel ever written! “The Great
Gatsby”, by F. Scott Fitzgerald!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Chapter One. “In my younger and more
vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning
over in my mind ever since. ‘Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,’
he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had
the advantages you’ve had.’”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tank you veddy much!!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “When I came back from the East last autumn, I
felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral
attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged
glimpses into the human heart…”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Chapter Two.</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: Is he ever going to stop?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Sure. When he reaches “The End.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s
running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with
her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its
peculiar quality of oppressiveness…”</p>
<p><strong>weak voice</strong>: Do Latka.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Look! I don’t have to tolerate this
impoliteness! Forget it – I’m gonna stop the show. GOODBYE!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “His presence gave the evening its peculiar
quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s
other parties that summer…”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our
arms farther… And one fine morning - So we beat on, boats against the
current borne back ceaselessly into the past.”</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Nobody likes anarchy more than me… but this
is science fiction!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Let’s get some breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What kind of show was this??! There were
three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m sorry, George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re DAMN RIGHT you’re sorry! And you –
you’re the road manager! You should be watchin’ out for him!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: We might have lost our focus…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: When you play the Midwest and South, you
DON’T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It’s not postmodern – it’s rude. If you
wanna perform in Texas, you give ’em Mighty Mouse! You give ’em
Elvis!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But George, I like to push the boundaries…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And that’s great. But do it in LA and New
York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap
on stage! I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: How long would they let me sleep?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know! and lowers his voice Andy… you
need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience… or
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m worried about Andy. His stress level is
affecting his work.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Isn’t Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe
that’ll chill him out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get
him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali… Find something
special. Something nice…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I dunno about this… What will my mother
think?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: She’ll say, “Now my son is a man.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s so dirty.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Nah. The girls sponge off between johns.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I vill haf both! I vill haf dat fraulein… unt…
the vun vith the big strudels!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: This is a big day. It’s my friend’s first
time with a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>madam</strong>: What’re you talking about? Andy comes here
almost every weekend.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: You’re talking about… Andy?</p>
<p><strong>madam</strong>: Oh, he doesn’t always call himself that.
Sometimes he’s Tony, and wears a tux.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You let me win.</p>
<p><strong>hooker</strong>: What if we did…?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey. If I give you three-hundred dollars, will
you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show?</p>
<p><strong>tony danza</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: He just arrived.</p>
<p><strong>carol kane</strong>: He’s an hour late.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Look, I’m told this Clifton guy is a little
eccentric. You’re all just gonna have to roll with the punches this
week.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Taxi! Laxy! Just the factsy, Maxie!
Them’s all the words that rhyme with taxi!… Right, girls?</p>
<p>****: I added me a musical number, cut out Judd Hirsch, and changed
the location to Mardi Gras!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: And now, the new theme song! “Oh yes,
we drive a taxi, And we’re havin’ fun. Yeah, we work together, And we
get the freakin’ job done.”</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: George, we’ve lost two days. Filming is on
Friday. We HAVE to let him go!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m not sure how Andy’s gonna take this…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: So we’ll go downstairs and tell him!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But that’s Tony down there. That’s not Andy.
Trust me, it’s like “Sybil” – Andy’s nowhere on the premises!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well whoever the fuck that is, I’m firing
him!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay. But we’ll have to warn Andy first. I
think he’s up in San Francisco, doing a concert.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Diane, this is George. I’m trying to
reach Andy up in San Francisco. Yeah, I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hi, George! Good to hear from you!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hi, Andy. How’s the weather up there?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m here with Ed over at Taxi. There’s been
some trouble with Tony.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh no! Did he get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: No, no, Andy, nothing like that. But… Tony’s not
fitting in. His style of performance is too… burlesque.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: “Burlesque”?</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Andy, I’m calling you up like this because I
have the utmost respect for your artistry. But – I need your permission
to fire him.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He’s
waited his whole life for this break.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: There’ll be other shots.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Andy, I have to do it. He’s a terrible
actor.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I guess I understand. But Ed – please… let him
down gentle.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yes, Andy, I will.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: We had a deal!!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: I don’t know what yer talkin’ about.
You musta talked to someone else –</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: I don’t know nothin’ about no Kaufman.
He’s been ridin’ my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin’ my
good name, to get places.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Get off my stage! You’re fired!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: I GOT A CONTRACT!! I’m gonna take you
to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Who’re YOU?!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: I’m from the LA Times. We’re doing a
little puff piece on Mr. Clifton. Mr. Kaufman arranged it.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Security! Escort this man off the lot!!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Stop! GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: I don’t want those pictures getting out.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: This is a closed set. You’ll have to
give me the film in that camera.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: I’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Wait – he’s one of THEM!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Stop! HELP! You wouldn’t do this to
Wayne Newton –</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Hey. Good hustlin’.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: That asshole! That FUCKING</p>
<p><strong>bastard!!</strong>: We had a fuckin’ deal, and THAT</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Um, Ed… you have a phone call –</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Well, um… it’s Andy Kaufman…</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Yeah???</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You were brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You were in the moment. You became a producer
losing his mind. It was the best improv I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Well – thank you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. See you next week.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is great! It makes Tony REAL - -
three-dimensional! It’s very good for his career.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: “Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if
it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Boy, they totally fell for it! I’m only acting
crazy!</p>
<p>****: Hey, can I please have some more seaweed?!</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at
Harrah’s Tahoe. We’d like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Ehh – Andy doesn’t really like playing
casinos. The audiences don’t work well for him.</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline
Harrah’s Tahoe??</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Eh, sure. We’re trying to expand our
audience base – and I know the college kids really love Andy
Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look – I gotta be clear with you. Tony
Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know! Wink wink! Nudge
nudge!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I’m serious. If you book Tony, do NOT
EXPECT TO GET ANDY.</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: I’ll take my chances!!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fine, be my guest! Book him.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Gene, you misunderstood!! You’re not getting
BOTH of them! It’s physically impossible!</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Why’s that? You said over and over and over,
Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman –</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But – trust me,
it’s not gonna happen!</p>
<p><strong>booker</strong>: Sure it is. Tony called me himself. He
yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy’s.
They’re both going on tonight, believe me!</p>
<p><strong>pushy man</strong>: You’re not listenin’! It’s a VERY simple
concept.</p>
<p><strong>wife of pushy man</strong>: You’re making no sense. How can
they be the same person –?</p>
<p><strong>pushy man</strong>: Trust me! You’ll never see them on stage
at the same time!</p>
<p><strong>pushy man</strong>: He’s never gonna start! Kaufman thinks
this is funny! We’ve paid forty bucks for a show that’s never gonna
start!</p>
<p><strong>wife of pushy man</strong>: You see! I told you! They’re not
the same person!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Thank you! Thank you! I wrote this
tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it…
but forgot to thank me on the album.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re so proud. You’re like some retarded
kid comin’ home from school: “Look, Dad, I got an F!”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But wasn’t it funny?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: “Funny”? I dunno. But “intriguing”…
“mindboggling”… perhaps “headache-inducing”… sure. Like, that moment,
when you both came onstage…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Uh-huh! See, with all these articles, people
think they’re insiders. They see Tony Clifton, and they say, “Ah, that’s
really Andy Kaufman.” But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me
is the truth! Tony’s not me! But maybe he is! The audience will never
know… They’ll think they’re laughin’ at me – but actually I’ll be
laughin’ at them, because they’re wrong and I’m right!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So you’ve got this big elaborate joke, which
is really only funny to two people in the universe. You… and you.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Sure! But WE think it’s kickass! Now I get to
be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else’s head!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But what’s the POINT? How will any of this
make you the biggest star in the world?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: George… I’m at a stage where the audience
expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or
setting the theater on fire, I don’t know what else to do. ’Cause I’ve
always got to be one step ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I feel you’re extending this philosophy
to real life. It’s obsessive. Nothing’s ever on the level anymore.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: George, it never was. Didn’t you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here’s an
evil Nazi – he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here’s an evil Japanese
guy!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: What is this, World War Two…?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy
wrestler…</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: No offense, pal, but I just don’t think
you’re built for it. These he- men’ll kick your ass!! They’re huge!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Maybe I’ll pick on someone smaller than
me…!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: … And I vow to continue wrestling until I am
BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the
mat!!</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: By a woman.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes! BY A WOMAN! I’m doing this because I feel
that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. Even if they train with
weights… it requires a certain mental ability – And, uh – I just don’t
feel they have that…</p>
<p><strong>merv</strong>: Any… volunteers…?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: I wanna kill that jerk.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Will you please shake hands, go to your
corners, and come out wrestling.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m the winner! I’ve got the</p>
<p><strong>brains!</strong>: Now baby, don’t fight nature! Get back in
the kitchen where you belong!!!</p>
<p><strong>guest coordinator</strong>: Here’s your complimentary photo
with Merv. Here’s your Turtle Wax –</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: I don’t need Turtle Wax.</p>
<p><strong>guest coordinator</strong>: Every guest of Merv gets it. And
here’s your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Gosh, you scored! Look at all those
goodies!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, I hope you didn’t take that stuff I said
seriously. It was just part of the show! It’s like the old days, when a
carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Oh. So you were just pretending to be an
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s what I’m good at!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of
hate mail. Andy, Merv Griffin doesn’t GET hate mail.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That means it was a success. I woke up the
audience – like punk rock!</p>
<p>****: Here, take this.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I’m not gonna take it. If I take it I’ll
break my back.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They’re having a laugh…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: WRONG! You haven’t given them any clues that
it’s a parody!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: That’s because they’ve only seen it once. But
I’ll do it again, and again, and AGAIN… They’ll catch on!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I am the Intergender Wrestling Champion of the
World!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Two, please.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Hi… am I late?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, I’m sure we’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I really want one. One large tub of popcorn,
please, extra butter.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy, the theater’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, I love movie theater popcorn… but that
doesn’t mean I have to sit through “On Golden Pond.”</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Why did you call me? The last person I ever
expected to get a call from was you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Gosh. Gee, Lynne… I was just so impressed with
your wrestling moves.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Hi… am I late?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, I’m sure we’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I really want one. One large tub of popcorn,
please, extra butter.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy, the theater’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey, I love movie theater popcorn… but that
doesn’t mean I have to sit through “On Golden Pond.”</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Why did you call me? The last person I ever
expected to get a call from was you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Gosh. Gee, Lynne… I was just so impressed with
your wrestling moves.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: You were impressed with something. It’s
pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national
television.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh! Uh, I hope I didn’t offend you.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: I’m here, ain’t I?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get
married?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Why Memphis?</p>
<p>****: Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I’ll go
in the ring, and I’ll announce that I will shave my head and marry any
woman who beats me! Then you’ll come up, we’ll wrestle and I’ll let you
win! Then you’ll scalp me, and we’ll get married on Letterman, like Tiny
Tim did on Carson… right there on the show! What do you say???</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: And all this will be for real?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: If you want…</p>
<p><strong>shut up!</strong>: SHUT UP! Show some respect! I want SILENCE
when I speak!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Look here, Andy Kaufman! I’ll take you on –
SISSY!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ooo, the little lady’s upset. Well I say – get
back in the kitchen!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: No! YOU get in the kitchen. I’m gonna make
you dry my dishes!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: STOP IT! This woman’s a FAKE! She’s nothing but
Kaufman’s girlfriend!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: T-that’s not true –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s a set-up! And I won’t allow our great
sport to be degraded by a fix!!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy… who is that…?</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: I’m Jerry Lawler, the KING of Memphis
wrestling!!</p>
<p>****: So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I’ve brought a real wrestler!
She’s trained and she’s READY!! Kaufman, do you think you can handle…
FOXY</p>
<p><strong>tattooed guy</strong>: Are you scared???</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: Alright, you won. GET OFF HER!</p>
<p><strong>angry voices</strong>: Jerry, help her! Get in there! Do
something!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: W-what are you DOING? I don’t fight men!</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: YEAH?! Well I got news for you, Andy
Kaufman! Wrestling is a serious sport to me! I don’t like anyone makin’
fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin’ the South! So we can settle this
two ways: We can go to court… or you can get in the ring with a man, and
wrestle for</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: He – can’t get away with this. YOU! You think
I’m CHICKEN?!</p>
<p>****: You wanna “wraaastle” me?! You wanna “WRAAASTLE” me??? Okay,
Lawler – let’s rumble! Yeah, I’ve only wrestled women, but they were
bigger than you! In fact, they’re probably smarter than you, ’cause
you’re from “Maaamphis, Taaanassee!” voice, he points at I’m from
Hollywood. I have the brains. That’s how I win. And Mr. Lawler, I’m
gonna make you cry “Mama!”</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Is this an act – or are you addicted to
causing trouble??</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: impersonates a I can shtop whenever I
want…</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Then stop treating me like a fucking
prop.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I-I’m sorry. I got caught up in the
action…!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: I’m warning you, Kaufman: One morning you’re
gonna wake up… and your head’s gonna be shaved.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy, do you realize you don’t do comedy
anymore? Where’s that sweet guy who used to do “Here I come to save the
day!”? Please, enough with the wrestling! You’ve lost touch with
reality!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: What, you don’t think I can beat him?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.
He’ll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South.
Then you get killed! And I did the bookings.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You said – live?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m not comfortable with the last sketch. I
DON’T do drug humor!</p>
<p><strong>jack burns</strong>: Andy, it’ll be fine! It’s what we’re
known for! “Maui?”Wowie!”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re not listening to me –</p>
<p><strong>jack burns</strong>: Don’t worry! The kids will love it –</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But I don’t do drugs! And I don’t enjoy making
light of them!</p>
<p>****: I was promised creative control!</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: What a prick!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: It’s on! JANICE, IT’S ON!</p>
<p>****: Between the studio and the show</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: In this next sketch, two married couples
are out to dinner. Now… everybody has secretly brought along a joint –
So, when each person leaves the table, they sneak into the restroom to
get a little high…</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I saw Michael!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Afterwards, I’ll take you backstage. You
can meet my brother.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “Gee, restaurants are amazing, aren’t they?
All these strangers sitting around… stuffing dead animals in their
faces! It’s just incredible!”</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: “If you say so.”</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: “Excuse me, I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Hmph! They sure didn’t give Andy much to
do.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: He said he’s coming back!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “Gee, that bathroom is so colorf–”</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You okay, honey? Something wrong, Carl?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I can’t, um…</p>
<p><strong>tech director</strong>: Shit…! What’s he doing??</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: It’s okay. Stay with it.</p>
<p><strong>richards</strong>: Just read the cue cards!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I can’t play stoned. I feel really stupid.</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You feel stupid? What about us?!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You didn’t have to do that!</p>
<p><strong>richards</strong>: Hey! CUT IT OUT!</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: You JERK!</p>
<p><strong>jack burns</strong>: Go to commercial, man! Get off the
stage!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I said I didn’t want to do the sketch.</p>
<p><strong>tech director</strong>: Go to three! Eh, go to four!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: I shoulda made him play outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>floor director</strong>: We’ve gone to commercial! I
said,</p>
<p><strong>melanie</strong>: Oh my God –!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why didn’t someone tell us???</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Excuse me!… I have an announcement to make!
You’ve all just participated in a “happening.” To make it real, some of
you knew, and some of you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Okay, great! So let’s reset!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Andy…!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Why is Andy doing this? Why?… Why?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: During the commercial, the people at ABC asked
me to apologize… and to tell you the truth. They wanted me to explain
that this whole fighting episode was staged…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And… um… I can’t do this. I-I can’t say it.
It’s a lie! A cover-up!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Cue the commercial!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: These kinds of things go on everyday at the
networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. fast,
to get in as much information Now for sure they’re gonna fire me, so if
you want to see me again, you’ll have to come to Memphis…</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: I’m gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: What’s in Memphis?</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Who knows?! That kid is totally
meshuga.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now! The MAIN EVENT of the evening!
The match you’ve been waiting for: The King Jerry Lawler, versus
Hollywood Andy Kaufman!</p>
<p><strong>upset voice</strong>: C’MON, KAUFMAN! Christ, you’re ON!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Before we begin this event, I just wanna say a
few things to you foul people. This city is filthy! You Southerners live
like pigs! So I’m going to teach you some lessons in hygiene… bring you
out of your squalor.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Why is he saying these things?!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: They’re gonna lynch him!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Nah. He’s just engaging a passive
audience.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: People, this is a bar of soap. Does it look
familiar to you? If you wet it, it’ll clean your hands.</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: Kaufman, we’ve had enough!! Let’s you and me
do what we came here for</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And Kaufman’s left the ring! Lawler’s
waiting for him to return.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Is this a strategy?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And Kaufman’s left the ring again! He
doesn’t seem interested in actually making contact with his
opponent.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Andy, please. Let’s go home!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Don’t worry, Mom. I’ll make you proud…!</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: Hey! Did you come down here to wrestle, or
to act like an ass?</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: It’s a side suplex!!</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Why isn’t he MOVING??</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER, which
is an AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION! Match goes to Kaufman by
disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds! Andy is splayed
unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>andy!!!</strong>: Somebody get a DOCTOR!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Andy!! Are you okay?!?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m fine, Mom, you can calm down.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: B-but… we saw… your neck…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Nah, it’s phony baloney – I faked the whole
thing. It didn’t hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head
in.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Andrew – HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew,
you were DYING! Look at your mother – she’s still shaking!</p>
<p><strong>andy!!!</strong>: Somebody get a DOCTOR!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Andy!! Are you okay?!?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’m fine, Mom, you can calm down.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: B-but… we saw… your neck…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Nah, it’s phony baloney – I faked the whole
thing. It didn’t hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head
in.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Andrew – HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew,
you were DYING! Look at your mother – she’s still shaking!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But that’s it. I needed you to believe! Our
family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they’ll be
touched. Because your emotions were honest!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Andy, I love you! I love you, whatever you
do…!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Geez, I’m sorry. Maybe I shouldn’t have put
you through all that… Well, from now on, you’ll always know the rule of
thumb: Anything that happens to me… IS NOT REAL.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: I don’t see any injury to your neck,
Mr. Kaufman.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: Positive.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: But my neck hurts… and I have a slight
cough…</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: It’s probably just a strained
muscle.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.</p>
<p><strong>old doctor</strong>: If it makes you happy…</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: “… has been rushed to a nearby hospital,
where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis. His parents are
at his bedside. Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on
television’s Taxi”…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death,
they’ll really miss me.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: It’s working for Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, he’s just laying low, waitin’ for his
comeback. God, listen to this! “It was morally wrong to take advantage
of such an unstable individual…”</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Wow, you can’t BUY this kind of
publicity!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: George, let’s not drop the ball on this. I’ve
made some kind of cosmic career move.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
I… I wanted to talk to you about booking Andy on “Saturday Night
Live.”</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: George – I don’t know if Andy works
for our show anymore. That wrestling stuff… is such a turnoff.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: We agree completely. Andy has to reconnect
with his core audience. So I got him on Letterman tonight. He’s gonna
apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy
shenanigans.</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: That’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s very sincere. And he needs your
show…</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: Okay. It’d be good to have the old
Andy back.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I apologize for all the wrestling I’ve ever
done. I’m sorry for all the abuse I’ve ever given… I was just playing
bad guy wrestler. That’s not me… it’s just a role. But Jerry took it
personally.</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: You said some pretty inflammatory
things.</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: He thinks everything’s a joke – but it’s
not. Did you laugh when you were layin’ in the hospital??</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: T-there wasn’t a reason to purposely hurt me
–</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: You’re a wimp.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My father said I should’ve gotten a lawyer
–!</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: Then your father’s a wimp.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And you’re just poor white trash!</p>
<p><strong>letterman</strong>: You said some pretty inflammatory
things.</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: He thinks everything’s a joke – but it’s
not. Did you laugh when you were layin’ in the hospital??</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: T-there wasn’t a reason to purposely hurt me
–</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: You’re a wimp.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My father said I should’ve gotten a lawyer
–!</p>
<p><strong>lawler</strong>: Then your father’s a wimp.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: And you’re just poor white trash!</p>
<p><strong>lorne michaels</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>smug comic</strong>: Hi. Um, we were supposed to have Andy
Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren’t sure if
it’s such a good idea. Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman’s
a comic genius. But others disagree… they say he’s just not funny
anymore. So we’re putting the decision up to you. Please call up and
vote. To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618. To DUMP him, call…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is bad… I only got 28 percent! I’m like
McGovern in ’72…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: And this wasn’t “Merv.” This was the hippest
audience on television. They’ve turned on you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We were just trying to push the envelope –</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!!
It hurts me to say this… but there’s only one solution – I don’t want
you two to ever work together again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry lawler</strong>: I’m sorry. We thought it was
funny…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Jer’, it’s not your fault. You were terrific.
But maybe George is right…</p>
<p><strong>jerry lawler</strong>: That’s fine. But I wouldn’t have
traded it for anything… Because for one brief, shining moment… the world
thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’ll stay in touch. Next time I’m in Memphis,
I’ll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate
cake.</p>
<p><strong>jerry lawler</strong>: Alright, buddy… Stay good.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back
on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy! You don’t get it! They don’t want you
back.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Open your eyes… close your eyes… open your
eyes… close your eyes… open your eyes… close your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Excuse me, Andy…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yes, your Holiness?</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: This is very difficult for me to say… but –
perhaps it would be best if you didn’t attend the retreat.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Why?? I… I attend every year.</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Yes – we do not doubt your devotion to TM. But
we feel that perhaps… you and the program have grown apart
philosophically.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: “Philosophically”?</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: The wrestling… the sexist remarks… the foul
language… these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. It
seems you have no respect for anything.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Of course I do…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Please! You’ve GOT to let me take the classes!
It’s how I keep myself</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: It is apparently not working.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: So HELP ME! All I wanna do is</p>
<p><strong>yogi</strong>: Andy, don’t raise your voice. We don’t wish
your presence here.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Oh, it’s open.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t deserve Haagen Daz. I’m a horrible
person.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy, you’re not horrible. You’re just…
complicated.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You don’t know the real me.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy… there is no real you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Do you wanna move in together?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey! Our first phone call! Hello?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy… it’s me. I’ve got some crummy news.
Taxi’s been canceled.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Um… no. Uh, I’m sorta busy right now. Thanks.
We’ll get together next week.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: And now we have a treat for you late- night
diehards. The star of Taxi – here in person, Andy Kaufman!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Actually, Budd, you’re wrong. I found out
today that Taxi’s been canceled.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I made six bucks. That’s good money.</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: This is a comedy club – not a medical
sideshow. If you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and
pull yourself together. Come back and do the material that people love:
Do the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy! Andy, you gotta snap out of this
funk! If you can – I’ll give you the headline spot tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, what’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>budd</strong>: George, you won’t believe it… I got Andy to do
all the old material! And he’s killin’ them!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: … but one ting I do not like is too much
traffic. Tonight I had to come on de freeway, and it was so much
traffic… It took me an hour and a half to get here!</p>
<p><strong>interrupting jerk</strong>: “Take my wife, please take
her.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: T-take my wife, please take her…</p>
<p><strong>interrupting jerk</strong>: “Her cooking is so bad, is
terrible.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: H-her cooking… Uh, cooking is so bad, is
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: “But right now I would like to do for you
some imitations. First, the Archie Bunker.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Sir, do you have a problem?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Yeah, my problem is you’re tired.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I, I was asked to do this material - -</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Sure, because your new stuff’s a bunch of
crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling… the hoaxes…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey – that stuff gets written-up in the papers
–</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Who gives a shit?! It’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why…? Andy, why…?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: I used to think you were original.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I was very original!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Yeah, exactly – “was”! But now, you’re
creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman’s so
desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I’m a plant. It’s just a
fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn’t that
true???</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was
just giving ’em what they want…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy, they don’t think you suck. They’ve
just… lost a reason to love you.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ll come up with something.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy!!… Where are you? I’ve been worried
sick… NOW??… Where do you want to meet?… Okay, I’ll call them…</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Look at that Grand Slam! Two eggs, two bacon,
two sausage, two pancakes – $2.99! How do they do it?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: They get you on the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Excuse me – but could Andy tell us why we’re
here???</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I have cancer.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Hey, that’s good! We can make that play. And
we’ll really drag it out. You get better, you get worse… you die…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: FORGET IT. It’s in terrible taste! I want
nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Andy, are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Serious like a heart attack! Hey, maybe I can
push you around in some goofy wheelchair!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, it’s true. I have lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s ridiculous. You don’t even smoke.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I – I got some freaky rare kind. It’s called
large-celled carcinoma.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: They don’t know… they’ve gotta run more
tests.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Have you told your family?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad – I’ve jerked ’em
around so many times.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy… you look me in the eye, and tell me
this is true.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: George – it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If I find out you’re behind this, I’ll kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: What are ya TALKIN’ ABOUT?! I was the one
saying I didn’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Exactly. That’s the sort of thing you guys
would work out to fuck me up.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: How can you be so casual??!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Even if I’m dying – I still need clean
socks.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: You’re NOT DYING!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: God, you’re so detached!!</p>
<p><strong>on the tv</strong>: It’s “Lassie.” Little TIMMY is laid-up in
bed, with a broken leg. Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book. Lassie
places the book on his lap. The boy smiles gratefully.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Thank you, girl. You’re my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Dad…?</p>
<p><strong>int. cedars sinai, radiation room - day</strong>: ANDY lies
under the machine. It bombards his body with powerful radiation.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The cancer started in Andy’s left arm and
spread to his lungs. We’ve initiated an aggressive radiation program…
see if we can eradicate the affected cells. Excuse me. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What a crock.</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: How dare you make light of this!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He’s not
gettin’ me again –</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Jesus! He’s got lung cancer!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: See, that’s exactly it! He picked lung
cancer, because he doesn’t smoke. That makes it weird! If he’d picked
leukemia, it’d be totally believable, and we’d all be going, “Poor Andy,
he’s really sick.” So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be
scratching our heads, saying, “Is this real?”</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Of course it’s real. We’re in a
hospital…</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Mom, it’s Cedars-Sinai! It’s a showbiz
hospital! Andy’s studio friends probably run this place!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: He plans these things out. He takes over,
hires actors… Personally, I didn’t think that “doctor” was very
convincing.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Did you notice his costume had the wrong
shoes?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Yeah! He didn’t have doctor shoes!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: We all know he’s talked about faking his
own death…</p>
<p><strong>stanley</strong>: Sure – but what if he isn’t? My son could
be dying… and we’re actin’ like we’re on Candid Camera.</p>
<p><strong>wild-haired man</strong>: I want you to visualize. Visualize
big, healthy white cells in your body. Now visualize little cancer
cells. Now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I see them… I see the white cells…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s visualization therapy. He’s helping me
turn inward and fight the disease.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He’s an actor. I remember him in “The
In-Laws.”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Uh, yes… that’s true. But he’s also ordained
in holistic medicine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You must take a little pleasure in it.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Of course! But that doesn’t mean I don’t need
everyone’s support! I can’t be surrounded by negative energy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Andy, you’re surrounded by what you create.
You are the KING of negative energy.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if
these bad vibes get out… then everyone will be talkin’ about how sick I
am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then – I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So how can I help you…?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I wanna go back to work and put on a happy
show. The best show anybody’s ever seen!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do you wanna tour the clubs?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie
Hall…!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: I’m working on a great cover story:
I’ve got a guy in the lab at Cedars. He says Andy Kaufman is dying of
lung cancer.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: What bullshit! No. No more Kaufman stories!
He’s burned us too many times!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Yeah, he’s definitely not dying. He’s
playing Carnegie Hall next month!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Jesus. Only Kaufman would use cancer as
a publicity stunt.</p>
<p><strong>cowboys and cowgirls</strong>: “I’ve got spurs That
jingle-jangle jingle…”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: This is great. The crowd’s gonna love this!
Hey… do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: I dunno. If they were, they’d be pushin’
80.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, call SAG. It’d be cool to get one on the
show. I want the evening to build and build. It’s gonna have the most
incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the “Hallelujah Chorus” – then the
sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: And you say, “Santa, what am I gettin’ for
Christmas?” And he says, “Cancer!”</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show
to be positive!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s great… but this show’s gonna cost a
fortune. Even if it sells out, you’ll still lose eighty grand.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t care about the money. I just want the
show to deliver.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So who’s gonna pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Tony Clifton.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know Tony doesn’t have that kind of
money.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Then he’ll borrow it. I know Tony better than
you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he’ll do
it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Okay, Andy. Will do.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Abbu daba, abi abbu daba! Abbu daba, abu dabu
do! Abbu dabbu da ba do…!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: A ba du ba ti la ma na go!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi tabu
la!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen! I’m pleased to announce
that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film,
Eleanor “Cody” Gould!!</p>
<p><strong>eleanor</strong>: Andy… this is so overwhelming…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well, it’s gettin’ even better! ’Cause we
found one of the original hobby horses! Do you – do you think you could
treat us to a few steps from “Jingle Jangle Jingle”?</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Is there a doctor in the house??!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, she’s alive!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Single file! Don’t rush! There’s enough
cookies for everyone!!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I don’t want this to ever end…</p>
<p><strong>healer</strong>: Now we’ll place a blue crystal. Very high
vibrations. It’s wonderful for it’s healing powers.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Okay. Let’s try two of those… and one of the
pink ones.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Your friend is doing four crystal
sessions a day, but it’s just not helping.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: I know… The cancer’s terminal.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Yes. That wasn’t made particularly
clear to us when he checked in…</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Look, personally, I think rubbing rocks on
people is a load of horseshit. But if it makes Andy happy, that’s all
that matters.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: I’m sorry to sound crass – but we
don’t want to be “that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman
died.” I’m going to have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: It’s okay, Bob. It wasn’t really working.
We’ll find something better.</p>
<p><strong>little wendy</strong>: What is this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: It’s all macrobiotic. Millet, burdock root,
kelp… Andy says it’ll purify him.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: What is that crap? Looks like
somethin’ my dog would puke up!!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: How ’bout me and you dolls go get some
REAL food: French fries and a Porterhouse steak!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: …Andy…?</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: I ain’t Andy! I’m Tony! Andy’s sick –
pick, chick, kick, lick! The doctor says he’s a goner. But Tony’s built
like a mule! Andy asked me to be his pallbearer! I’ll do it for him! I’m
getting stronger and stronger! Here, watch this!</p>
<p><strong>lynne</strong>: Stop it! C’mon, put that down.</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Yeah, you’re right. We better get
movin’. We don’t wanna miss Happy Hour at Kelbos – all the Mai Tai’s you
can drink for $4.99.</p>
<p><strong>lynne and little wendy</strong>: Andy!!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Dammit…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I can’t move my arm.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’ve got good days and bad days.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: My hair is coming out.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: I’ve got an idea for a new TV show for me to
star in. It’s called “Uncle Andy’s Fun House” – it’ll be a Saturday
morning thing where I can goof off with the kids. You know, puppets,
magic tricks…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I think we can sell that.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Hey… thanks for always backin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Did your – doctor say it’s okay for you to
go back to work?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way,
I’d be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I’ve
found a new guy who’s gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Yeah! He’s a psychic surgeon in the
Philippines, and he’s amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right
out!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: The Philippines? I dunno… Andy… he sounds
like one of your characters.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: No… this guy’s special. He performs
miracles.</p>
<p><strong>andy’s pov</strong>: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING
MOURNERS. All are in black. Everyone’s quiet, in a state of shock.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Well… My show is over. I did my best, and I
just want to say, until we meet again… please remember: “In this
friendly, friendly world… With each day so full of joy. Why should any
heart be lonely.”</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s a perfect Kaufman audience.</p>
<p><strong>zmuda</strong>: Yeah. They don’t know whether to be sad, or
angry.</p>
<p><strong>carol kane</strong>: Why are people leaving? The curtain’s
gonna open. Andy’s gonna come out… I know it!</p>
<p><strong>tony danza</strong>: Sure, the body was just made of wax…!
Wasn’t it……?</p>
<p><strong>dude #2</strong>: Oh my GOD. That’s the freakiest thing I’ve
ever seen!! Look!</p>
<p><strong>dude #1</strong>: Man, we were right! He’s not dead!</p>
<p><strong>dude #2</strong>: He’s just been lyin’ low for a year!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen! Please put your
hands together for… Tony Clifton!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Andy!</p>
<p><strong>tony clifton</strong>: Don’t know nothin’ about no Andy. Just
some dead guy tryin’ to ride my coattails. Let’s HIT IT, boys! One, two,
anda one two three four!</p>
<p><strong>i will survive!</strong>: As long as I know how to love, I
know I’ll simply stay alive!”</p>
