<p><strong>voice</strong>: You Mongrel! Why do you howl When it is I who
am bitten?</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: What am I, Mr. Lambert?</p>
<p><strong>lambert</strong>: Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?</p>
<p><strong>frees</strong>: Twelve pounds, one shilling and four pence,
Mr. Fennyman, including interest.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Aaagh! I can pay you!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For
pity’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Take his feet out. Where will you get</p>
<p><strong>frees</strong>: Sixteen pounds, five shillings and nine
pence</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: including interest in three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: I have a wonderful new play!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Put his feet in.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It’s a comedy.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Cut his nose off.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: And his ears.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: And a share. We will be partners,
Mr. Fennyman!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Partners!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It’s a crowd-tickler–mistaken identities,
a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.</p>
<p><strong>lambert</strong>: I think I’ve seen it. I didn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: This time it is by Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: What’s the title?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Romeo and Ethel the Pirate’s Daughter.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Good title.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: A play takes time. Find actors�
rehearsals�let’s say open in three weeks. That’s–what–five hundred
groundlings at tuppence each, in addition four hundred groundlings
tuppence each, in addition four hundred backsides at three pence–a penny
extra for a cushion, call it two hundred cushions, say two performance
for safety how much is that Mr. Frees?</p>
<p><strong>frees</strong>: Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Correct!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: But I have to pay the actors and the
authors.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: A share of the profits.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: There’s never any</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on
something.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Romeo and Ethel The Pirate’s
Daughter�Almost finished?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Without doubt he is completing it at this
very moment.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have
it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the
sun doth move</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: No, no, we haven’t the time. Talk prose.
Where is my play?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is all locked safe in here</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: God be praised! Locked?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: As soon as I have found my muse</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Who is she this time?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She is always Aphrodite.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the
Dog and Trumpet?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you
understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Well, I am a dead man and buggered to
boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company
is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain’s
Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece,
written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and
grateful -</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What piece? Richard Crookback?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: No–it’s comedy they want, Will! Comedy!
Like Romeo and Ethel?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who wrote that?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave
you three pounds a month since.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Half what you owed me. I am still due for One
Gentleman of Verona.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: . . . Will! What is money to you and me?
I, your patron, you my wordwright! When the plague lifts Burbage will
have a new Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain and I have nothing for
the Rose.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty
pounds?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Fifty pounds? What for?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Burbage offers me a partnership in the
Chamberlain’s Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the
dogs!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, then.</p>
<p><strong>makepeace</strong>: and the Lord shall smite them! Yea,
harken to me. The theatres are handmaidens of the devil! Under the name
of the Curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in
your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your
children! And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name! I say a plague on
both their houses!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To my weekly confession.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Words, words, words�once, I had the gift�I
could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love
that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come
hellfire and brimstones�for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a
nunnery�but now</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: And yet you tell me you lie with
women?</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage’s
seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have
lost my gift.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: I am here to help you. Tell me in your own
words.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have lost my gift. It’s as if my quill is
broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud
tower of my genius has collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Nothing comes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: Most interesting.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet
herring.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act
of love?</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: How long has it been?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A goodly length in times past, but lately</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: No, no. You have a wife, children</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Not much sand left.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I was a lad of eighteen. Anne Hathaway was a
woman, half as old again.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: A woman of property?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She had a cottage. One day, she was three
months gone with child, so</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: And your relations?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: On my mother’s side the Ardens</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: No, your marriage bed.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Four years and a hundred miles away in
Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a
blessing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: So now you are free to love</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: yet cannot love nor write it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: Here is a bangle found in Psyche’s temple
on Olympus cheap at four pence. Write your name on a paper and feed it
in the snake.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will it restore my gift?</p>
<p><strong>dr. moth</strong>: The woman who wears the snake will dream
of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will
see you in a week.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Now where? Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To the Palace at Whitehall.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg. You too, good
Crab.</p>
<p><strong>kempe</strong>: Crab is nervous. He has never played the
Palace. When will you write me a tragedy, Will? I could do it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played
it.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress
Rosaline, where were my seamstress’s eyes?</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: There is no dog in the first scene, Will
Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am still owed money for this play,
Burbage.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Not from me. I only stole it. When are you
coming over to the Chamberlain’s Men?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: When I have fifty pounds.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Are you writing?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy,
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: What is the chief part?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: The title?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Romeo</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It’s for Henslowe. He paid me.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ten pounds.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: You’re a liar.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the
Admiral’s Men.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Ned is wrong for it.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Here is two sovereigns–I’ll give you two
more when you show me the pages.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Burbage, I will see you hanged for a
pickpocket.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy
and the Master of the Revels favours us.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive
from you?</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: She comes!</p>
<p><strong>condell as valentine</strong>: “Cease to persuade, my loving
Proteus; Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits�”</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: When will you write me a sonnet, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have lost my gift.</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: You left it in my bed. Come to look for it
again.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: Burbage has my keeping but you have my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You see? The consumptives plot against me.
“Will Shakespeare has a play, let us go and cough through it.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I feel a scene coming on.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Is it about a pirate’s daughter?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: You see? Comedy.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Well played, Master Crab, I commend you.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Love and a bit with a dog, that’s what
they like.</p>
<p><strong>condell as valentine</strong>: “What light is light if Silvia
be not seen? What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think
that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection�”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: There’s a lady knows your play by
heart.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?
Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I liked the dog, for laughs.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But Silvia I did not care for much. His
fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.
Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our
heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see
another?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: When the Queen commands it.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But at the playhouse. Nurse?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Be still.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I am not so well-born.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Well-monied is the same as well-born and
well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: All the men at court are without poetry. If
they look at me they see my father’s fortune. I will have poetry in my
life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Like Valentine and Silvia?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: No . . . not the artful postures of love, but
love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in
the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there
has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a .
. .</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: As a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good
Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if
I could dream myself into a company of players.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Clean your teeth while you dream, then.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Now spit</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: This time we take your boots off!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: The theatres are all closed by the
plague!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Oh, that.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: by order of the Master of the Revels!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the
theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable
obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by
the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns
out well.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>lambert</strong>: Should I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?</p>
<p><strong>messenger</strong>: The theatres are reopened. By order of
the Master of the Revels, the theatres are reopened</p>
<p><strong>frees</strong>: Mr. Fennyman! Mr. Tilney has opened the
playhouses.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Yes I heard.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: If you wouldn’t mind</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Where is the play?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Oh, it’s coming, it’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Will! The theatres are</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I’m
good!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Rosaline? You mean Ethel.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Richard!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Burbage?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mr. Tilney</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Like you, I found him not at home!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: So this is the favour you find in the
Chamberlain’s Men.</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage
he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: What does Burbage care of that? He is
readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You have opened the playhouses?</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: I have, Master Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But the plague</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Yes, I know. But he was always hanging
around the house.</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: Will�you’re the only one, Will!–in my
heart.</p>
<p><strong>nol</strong>: Mr. Henslowe!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Yes, I heard. The theatres are open. But
where is my playwright?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Chalk it up, Nol. I’m hungry, too.</p>
<p><strong>nol</strong>: The special today is a pig’s foot marinated in
juniper-berry vinegar, served with a buckwheat pancake which has
been</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Will! Have you finished?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes. Nearly. It’s all locked safe in here. We
need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have
a nice little part.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Ned Alleyn and the Admiral’s Men are out
on tour. I need actors. Those here who are unknown will have a chance to
be known.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: What about the money, Mr. Henslowe?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It won’t cost you a penny! Auditions in
half-an-hour!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Ralph Bashford! I’d have a part for you
but, alas, I hear you are a drunkard’s drunkard.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Never when I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Give me to drink mandragora.</p>
<p><strong>barman</strong>: Straight up, Will?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Give my friend a beaker of your best
brandy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Kit</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: How goes it, Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wonderful, wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Burbage says you have a play.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have. And chinks to show for it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I insist–and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The
BARMAN does the business.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I hear you have a new play for the
Curtain.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Not new–my Doctor Faustus.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I love your early work. “Was this the face
that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of
Ilium?”</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: I have a new one nearly done, and better.
The Massacre at Paris.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good title.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: And yours?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Romeo and Ethel the Pirate’s Daughter. Yes, I
know.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: What is the story?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well, there’s a pirate In truth, I have not
written a word.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Romeo is�Italian. Always in and out of
love.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, that’s good. Until he meets</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Ethel.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you think?</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: The daughter of his enemy.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The daughter of his enemy.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: His best friend is killed in a duel by
Ethel’s brother or something. His name is Mercutio.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mercutio�good name.</p>
<p><strong>nol</strong>: Will–they’re waiting for you!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good luck with yours, Kit.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: I thought your play was for Burbage.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: This is a different one.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: A different one you haven’t written?</p>
<p><strong>young actor</strong>: ” �Was this the face that launched a
thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen, make
me immortal with a kiss!”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>second actor</strong>: I would like to give you something
from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: How refreshing.</p>
<p><strong>second actor</strong>: “Was this the face that launched a
thousand ships, And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?”</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: “�the topless towers of Ilium? Sweet Helen,

<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>wabash</strong>: “W-w-w-w-was th-th-this th-th-the f-f-
f-face�”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Very good, Mr. Wabash. Excellent. Report
to the property master.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a
few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see
a Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I did not.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can
I see pages?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Tomorrow</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: please God.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: May I begin, sir?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Thomas Kent. I would like to do a
speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: “What light is light, if Silvia be
not seen, What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by? Unless it be to think
that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: ” �except I be by Silvia in the
night, There is no music in the nightingale. Unless I look on Silvia in
the day, There is no day for me to look upon.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Take off your hat.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: My hat?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where did you learn how to do that?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wait there.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Are you Mr. Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let me see you. Take off your hat.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: What are we playing?</p>
<p><strong>nol</strong>: Where are the pages?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Where’s the boy?</p>
<p><strong>wabash</strong>: B-b-b-b-break a l-l-l-leg!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Follow that boat!</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Right you are, governor!</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: I know your face. Are you an actor?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Yes, I’ve seen you in something. That one
about a king.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat
once.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you know that house?</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Sir Robert De Lesseps.</p>
<p><strong>lady de lesseps</strong>: Tomorrow he drags me off to the
country and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our
estates.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: God save you, mother. Ho water, nurse.</p>
<p><strong>scullery maid</strong>: Thomas Kent, sir? No sir.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The actor</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Who asks for him?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: William Shakespeare, actor, poet, and
playwright of the Rose.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Master Kent is�my nephew.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I will wait.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Much god may it do you.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a
young man of Verona.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Verona again.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in
the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from
the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was
robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Be off!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your mother, and your father</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: From tomorrow, away in the country for three
weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: He looks well enough for a mountebank.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life
of Viola De Lesseps’s dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My lady, this play will end badly. I will
tell.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You will not tell. As you love me and as I
love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy’s wig!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Master Plum! What business here?</p>
<p><strong>musician</strong>: A five shilling business, Will. We play
for the dancing.</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Musicians don’t eat, Sir Robert’s
orders.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I seek Master Thomas Kent.</p>
<p><strong>sir robert</strong>: She is a beauty, my lord, as would take
a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged
for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when
your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?</p>
<p><strong>sir robert</strong>: She will breed. If she do not, send her
back.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Is she obedient?</p>
<p><strong>sir robert</strong>: As any mule in Christendom. But if you
are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I like her.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: By all the stars in heaven, who is she?</p>
<p><strong>musician</strong>: Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Master Shakespeare</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: My lady Viola.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: My lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I have spoken with your father.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: So my lord? I speak with him every day.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Good sir� ?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I heard you are a poet.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But a poet of no words?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: “Poet?”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: anaesthetic and not noticing</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How do I offend, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood
in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Christopher Marlowe at your service.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of Verona. A
comedy. By William Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My lady!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Who is there?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Will Shakespeare!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master
Shakespeare?!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The same, alas.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh but why “alas?”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A lowly player.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest
poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh–I am him too!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Anon, anon! I will come again.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, I am fortune’s fool, I will be punished
for this!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh my lady, my love!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: If they find you here they will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You can bring them with a word.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, not for the world!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Anon, nurse!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: “Draw if you be men! Gregory, remember thy
washing blow.”</p>
<p><strong>nol</strong>: “Part, fools, put up your swords.”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It starts well, and then it’s all long-
faced about some Rosaline. Where’s the comedy, Will. Where’s the dog? Do
you think it is funny?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I was a Pirate King, now I’m a Nurse. That’s
funny</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We are at least six men short, and those we
have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back
to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: We are at least four acts short, Will, if
you are looking for disaster.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Who are you, master?</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate’s daughter.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I’ll be damned if you are!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Is it going well?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: But nothing is happening.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Yes, but very well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Nobody. The author.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We are about to embark on a great voyage.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It is customary to make a little speech on
the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You want to know what parts you are to
receive. All will be settled as we go</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Huzzah! The Admiral’s Men are returned to
the house!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Silence, you god! I am Hieronimo! I am
Tamburlaine! I am Faustus! I am Barrabas, the Jew of Malta–of yes,
Master Will, and I am Henry VI. What is the play, and what is my
part?</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: A moment, sir!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: I am the money!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Then you may remain so long as you remain
silent. Pay attention and you will see how genius creates a legend.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a
young nobleman of Verona</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: And the title of this piece?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mercutio</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: I will play him!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan!
James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love
again?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I am, Master Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: But your voice Have they dropped?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is
lying but WILL has turned away.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Master Henslowe, you have your actors.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: I saw his Tamburlaine, you know.
Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Of course, it was mighty writing. There is
no one like Marlowe</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Better fortune, boy.</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: I was in a play. They cut my head off in
Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You admire it?</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: I like it when they cut heads off. And the
daughter mutilated with knives.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh. What is your name?</p>
<p><strong>urchin.</strong>: John Webster. Here, kitty, kitty.</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: Plenty of blood. That is the only
writing.</p>
<p><strong>urchin</strong>: Wait, you’ll see the cat bites his head
off.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have to get back.</p>
<p><strong>montague</strong>: “I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To
hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Cut round him for now.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: What? Who?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: The one who came with your letter?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “Good morrow, cousin.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Is the day so young?”</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “But new struck nine.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was
that my father that went hence so fast?”</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: It was. What sadness lengthens
Romeo’s hours?”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Not having that which, having,
makes them short.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “In love?”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Out.”</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “Of love?”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Out of her favour where I am in
love.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, no, no�Don’t spend it all at once!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Do you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He is speaking about a baggage we never even
meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Juliet? You mean Ethel.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: God’s teeth, am I to suffer this constant
stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the
love of his life?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: I am very sorry, sir, I have not
seen Act Two.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Of course you have not! I have not written
it!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go once more!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Will�Where is Mercutio?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your
safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: A sonnet? You mean a play.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Two hours at prayer!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Lady Viola is pious, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer
is not piety, it is self- importance!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It would be better that you return tomorrow,
my lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: It would be better that you tell her to get
off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: My lady VIOLA.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I am aware of it, but it is beauty’s
privilege.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You flatter, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her
majesty’s consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once
gained, her consent is her command.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Do you intend to marry, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Your father should keep you better informed.
He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married
two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I do not love you, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: How your mind hops about! Your father was a
shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune.
That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like
Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Virginia?!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put
my investments to work–I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay
there long, three or four years . . .</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But why me?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: It was your eyes. No, your lips.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Will you defy your father and your
Queen?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: The Queen has consented?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come
Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I will do my duty, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: “Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I
beseech you, banish me from yours–I am to marry Lord Wessex– a
daughter’s duty�”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Gentlemen upstage, ladies downstage!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Gentlemen upstage! Ladies downstage! Are you
a lady, Mr. Kent?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You did not like the speech?</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: The speech is excellent. “Oh, then I see
Queen Mab hath been with you!” Excellent and a good length. But then he
disappears for the length of a bible.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There you have his duel, a skirmish of words
and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such passion
and poetry as your ever heard: “a plague on both your houses!”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: He dies?</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: And where are my pages . . .</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Did you give her my letter?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: And this for you.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am
unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Writer, is he?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Row your boat.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She tells me to keep away. She is to marry
Lord Wessex. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: If you love her, you must do what
she asks.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And break her heart and mine?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: It is only ours you can know.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: She loves me, Thomas!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Does she say so?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No. And yet she does where the ink has run
with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: I � Her letter came to me by the
nurse.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Your aunt?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept
a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Like a sickness and its cure together.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Yes, like rain and sun, like cold
and heat. Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the
country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I
was born to look in them and know myself.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: And her lips?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose
would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: And her voice? Like lark song?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks!
I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her
song.</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: She sings too?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute,
she has a natural ear. And her bosom–did I mention her bosom?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: What of her bosom?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and
rare as golden apples!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: I think the lady is wise to keep
your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to,
when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine?
Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with
a Bankside poet and player?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or
riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays
the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied
blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: But what of Lord Wessex?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For one kiss, I would defy a thousand
Wessexes!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, Will!</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Thank you, my lady!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Lady?</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was
this high. Wouldn’t deceive a child.</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: Strangely enough, I’m a bit of a writer
myself.</p>
<p><strong>boatman</strong>: It wouldn’t take you long to read it, I
expect you know all the booksellers . . .</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Can you love a fool?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Can you love a player?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as
mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Answer me only this: are you the author of
the plays of William Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I do not know how to undress a man.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is strange to me, too.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Go to, go to.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I would not have thought it. There is
something better than a play.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There is.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Even your play.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: And that was only my first try.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Well perhaps better than my first.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Will</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You would not leave me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I must. Look– how pale the window.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Moonlight!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No, the morning rooster woke me.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It was the owl–come to bed</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, let Henslowe wait.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Mr. Henslowe?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Let him be damned for his pages!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh–no, no!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There is time. It is still dark.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the
owl.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You would leave us players without a scene to
read today?!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My lady, the house is stirring, it is a new
day.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It is a new world!</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “�Have not saints lips, and holy
palmers too?”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use
in prayer.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Oh then, dear saint, let lips do
what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Saints do not move, though grant for
prayer’s sake.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Suffering cats!</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Then move not, while my prayer’s
effect I take.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin
is purg’d.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Then have my lips the sin that they
have took.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Sin from my lips? Oh trespass
sweetly urg’d. Give me my sin again.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes�yes�er�not quite right�it is more let me
“Then have my lips the sin that they have took.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: Sin from my lips? Oh trespass
sweetly urg’d. Give me my sin again.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “You kiss by th’ book.”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Well! It was lucky you were here! Why do not
I write the rest of your play while you</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, yes�continue. Now the Nurse. Where is
Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Madam, your mother craves a word
with you.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “What is her mother?”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Marry bachelor, Her mother is the
lady of the house�”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “�And a good lady, and wise and
virtuous. I nurse her daughter that you talk’d withal�”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Is she a Capulet” Oh dear account.
My life is my foe’s debt.”</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “Away, be gone, the sport is at
best.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Ay, so I fear; the more is my
unrest.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Come hither nurse. What is yond
gentleman?”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh let it be night!</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “I know not.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Go ask his name–If he be married, My
grave is like to be my wedding bed.”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, do not go</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I must. I must</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of your great enemy.”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Terrible!</p>
<p><strong>insert manuscript</strong>: “But soft, what light through
yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun.” VIOLA’S
VOICE OVER speaks the line.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “But soft, what light through yonder window
breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun!”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon Who
is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair
than she�”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, Will!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Yes, some of it is speakable.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “It is my lady, O it is my love! O that she
knew she were!”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “The brightness of her cheek would
shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would
through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think
it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I
were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Ay me.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “She speaks.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Oh Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my
love And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Shall I hear more or shall I speak
at this?”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “What man art thou that thus bescreen’d in
night So stumblest on my counsel?”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “�By a name I know not how to tell
thee who I am: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is
an enemy to thee�”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find
thee here. If they do see thee, they will murder thee.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Alack, there lies more peril in
thine eye, Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am
proof against their enmity.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: I would not for the world!</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: I have night’s cloak to hide me from
their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Good night, good night. As sweet repose and
rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so
unsatisfied?”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: That’s my line!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, but it is mine too!</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “O wilt thou leave me so
unsatisfied?”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “What satisfaction can’st thou have
tonight?”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “The exchange of thy love’s faithful
vow for mine.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love
as deep:</p>
<p><strong>viola and will</strong>: the more I give to thee The more I
have, for both are infinite.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “I hear some noise within. Dear love,
adieu.”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Anon, good Nurse</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Anon, good Nurse–Sweet Montague be
true.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Stay but a little, I will come again.”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Stay but a little, I will come
again.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as romeo</strong>: “Oh blessed blessed night.”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “I am feared,</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “�All my fortunes at thy foot I’ll
lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world.”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Madam!”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “I come, anon–But if thou meanest not
well, I do beseech thee–”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Madam!”</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: By and by I come to cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief. A thousand times good night!”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I cannot move in this dress! and it makes me
look like a pig! I have no neck in this pig dress! Oh, she’s off again!
She says she’s going and then she doesn’t</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How is it?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ned�I know�I know</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: The title won’t do.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Ah</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Romeo and Juliet–just a suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Thank you, Ned.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You are a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: You mean, no dog of any kind?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The Friar married them in secret, then Ned
gets into a fight with one of the Capulets, Romeo tries to stop them, he
gets in Ned’s way, I mean in Mercutio’s way, so Tybalt kills Mercutio
and then Romeo kills Tybalt. Then the Prince banishes him from
Verona.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked on the island of the Pirate King.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Cease your prattling! Get out! A thousand
apologies!</p>
<p><strong>sam as juliet</strong>: “Good night, good night. Parting is
such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sunday�it is Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I found something in my sleep. The Friar who
married them will take up their destinies.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, but it will end well for love?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am
writing now. A broad river divides my lovers–family, duty, fate–as
unchangeable as nature.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen
season.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Not ready? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Sunday! Greenwich!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Now, pay attention, Nursy. The Queen,
Gloriana Regina, God’s Chosen Vessel, the Radiant One, who shines her
light on us, is at Greenwich today, and prepared, during the evening’s
festivities, to bestow her gracious favour on my choice of wife–and if
we’re late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive. So you get you to
my lady’s chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: What will you have me do? Marry you
instead?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: To be the wife of a poor player?–can I wish
that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were
free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You follow your desire freely enough in the
night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Then I will go with you.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You cannot, Wessex will kill you</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I know how to fight!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my
heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry
Wessex a week from Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: By heaven, I will drag her down, by the
Queen’s command</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Good morning, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but
I swear it would wait for you!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Here we come at last, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Are you bringing your laundry woman?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Her chaperone. My lady’s country cousin. My,
but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss
Wilhelmina!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she
never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>lord in waiting</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: The Queen asks for you. Answer well.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Is there a man?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A man, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: There was a man, poet–a theatre poet, I
heard–does he come to the house?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A theatre poet?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he
said, Christopher Marlowe–has he been to the house?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely
waistcoat, shame about the poetry.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: That dog!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Stand up straight, girl.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I have seen you. You are the one who comes to
all the plays–at Whitehall, at Richmond.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Your Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: What do you love so much?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Your Majesty</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love
stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I love theatre. To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is indeed</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: They are not acted for you, they are acted
for me.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: And–?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: And I love poetry above all.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Above Lord Wessex?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: My Lord–when you cannot find your wife you
had better look for her at the playhouse.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: But playwrights teach nothing about love,
they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They
cannot make it true.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, but they can!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I mean�Your Majesty, they do not, they have
not, but I believe there is one who can</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Lady Viola is�young in the world. Your
Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of
playacting. I’ll wager my fortune.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: I thought you were here because you had
none.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Well, no one will take your wager, it
seems.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Fifty pounds!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very
worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I
bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion
arises. I have not seen anything to settle it yet. So–the fireworks will
be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola’s audience. Have her
then, but you are a lordly fool. She has been plucked since I saw her
last, and not by you. It takes a woman to know it.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Marlowe!</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Burbage!</p>
<p><strong>burbage’s voice</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Marlowe.</p>
<p><strong>burbage’s voice</strong>: Kit!</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: You are playing my Faustus this afternoon.
Don’t spend yourself in sport.</p>
<p><strong>rosaline</strong>: This afternoon!–we’ll still be here this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: What do you want, Kit?</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: My Massacre at Paris is complete.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: You have the last act?</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: You have the money?</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Then tomorrow you will have the pages.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Wait! Will you desist!</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Twenty pounds on delivery</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: What is money to me like us? Besides, if I
need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Romeo?–he gave it to Henslowe.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my
respects, Miss Rosaline.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for
Romeo!</p>
<p><strong>marlowe</strong>: You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral’s
Men have the playing of it as the Rose.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Treachery!</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Traitor and thief!</p>
<p><strong>nol as benvolio</strong>: “By my head, here comes the
Capulets.”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn as mercutio</strong>: “By my heel, I care not.”</p>
<p><strong>james hemmings as tybalt</strong>: “Follow me close, for I
will speak to them. Gentlemen, good e’en: a word with one of you.”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Are you going to do it like that? And before
the humbled actor can reply NED continues.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: And but one word with one of us? Couple it
with something, make it a word and a blow.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Where is that thieving hack who can’t keep
his pen in his own ink pot!?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What is this rabble?!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Not with my props!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Will! What–?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A literary feud. Quite normal.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Stay hid!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. You were
cast ashore in a far country.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: We need that for the balcony scene!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: My poor Rose!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: My investment! LAMBERT!!!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I
explained to you, the theatre business</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my
business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don’t tell
me about business</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: A famous victory! Kegs and legs. Open and
on the house! Oh what happy hour!</p>
<p>****: Poxy Pol! You keep yourself to yourself I’ll not have you
infecting my investment!</p>
<p>****: Is this a tavern?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is also a tavern.</p>
<p><strong>pretty whore</strong>: I remember you! The poet!</p>
<p><strong>pretty whore</strong>: One at a time, one at a time!</p>
<p><strong>second whore</strong>: Oh, he’s a pretty one! Tell me your
story while I tickle your fancy!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: Oh!–it’s–it’s–oh, it’s a house of
ill- repute!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come,
there is no harm in a drink.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Never when I’m working!</p>
<p><strong>pretty whore</strong>: Never tried it? Never? I think you are
ready, Sam!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: You are welcome to my best house! Here’s
to the Admiral’s Men!</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: The Admiral’s Men!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I�quite liked it.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Master Kent! You have not dipped your
wick?</p>
<p><strong>viola as thomas</strong>: My wick?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you
must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but
vital role.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: By heaven, I thank you! I will be your
Apothecary!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: I am to be in your play.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: And what is this play about?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: Well, there’s this Nurse</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of
the Apothecary!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: The Apothecary? Will, what is the story?
Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: By God, I wish I knew.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let
us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to
Stratford to your wife!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A black day for us all! There is news come up
river from Deptford. Marlowe is dead.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Stabbed! Stabbed to death in a tavern at
Deptford!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh�what have I done?</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: He was the first man among us. A great light
has gone out.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It was I who killed him! God forgive me, God
forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: You look sad, my lady! Let me take you
riding.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It is not my riding day, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Bless me, I thought it was a horse.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I am going to church.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I understand of course. It is to be
expected.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It is to be expected on a Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: And on a day of mourning. I never met the
fellow but once at your house.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Oh!–dear God, I did not think it would be me
to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: He is dead?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then,
we’ll say a prayer for his soul</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My lady�my lady�now is the time to show your
breeding.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for the
love of Christ!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Spare me!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It is worse. I have killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Marlowe’s touch was in my Titus Andronicus and
my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You never spoke so well of him.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: He was not dead before. I would exchange all
my plays to come for all of his that will never come.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You lie.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You lie in your meadow as you lied in my
bed.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I
cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife
come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your
bed.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up
the prize for a sonnet.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I was the more deceived.</p>
<p><strong>voila</strong>: Yes–you were deceived. For I never loved you
till now.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I love you, Will, beyond poetry.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh, my love You ran from me before.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You were not dead before. When I thought you
dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that
I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You cannot marry Wessex!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause
and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: No�no.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these
vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: For killing Juliet’s kinsman Tybalt, the one
who killed Romeo’s friend Mercutio, Romeo is banished</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: but the Friar who married Romeo and Juliet</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Is that me. Will?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You, Edward. The Friar who married them gives
Juliet a potion to drink. It is a secret potion. It makes her seeming
dead. She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets. She will awake to life
and love when Romeo comes to her side again.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have not said all. By malign fate, the
message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar’s plan. He hears
only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb
to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the
poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: And so Juliet takes his dagger and kills
herself.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Well, that will have them rolling in the
aisles.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet
cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Yes–it will serve. But there’s a scene
missing between marriage and death.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: The play. All written out for you. I had the
clerk at Bridewell do it, he has a good fist for lettering.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: There’s a new scene</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Will you read it for me?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day&gt;
It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow
of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me,
love, it was the nightingale.”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No
nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing
clouds in yonder east. Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or
stay and die.”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I. It
is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a
torchbearer�”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: “�thou need’st not to be gone.”</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: “I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is’t my soul? Let’s
talk. It is not day.”</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: You will go far, I fear.</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: I hope we work together again. Tilney walks
away.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: “Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua’s law
Is death to any he that utters them.” Then him. Then me.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: “Such mortal drugs I have�” What is it?
What is it?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: My lord!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Shakespeare!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you
your place, which is in hell!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You are on my ground.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: By God, I’ll fight the lot of you</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am more than enough.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Absent friends! This is the murderer of Kit
Marlowe!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Will</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I rejoiced at his death because I thought it
was yours. That is all I know of Marlowe.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: It’s true, Will–it was a tavern
brawl�Marlowe attacked, and got his own knife in the eye. A quarrel
about the bill</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: The bill! Oh, vanity, vanity!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Not the billing, the bill!</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Oh God, I am free of it!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Close it!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: My Lord Wessex!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Close it! Take it down stone by stone! I
want it ploughed into the ground, and sown with quick lime!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Mr. Tilney, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Sedition and indecency!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Master of the Revels, sir, over here,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Where, boy?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I saw her bubbies!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: A woman on the stage? A woman?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I swear it!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: So, Henslowe! I say this theatre is closed!
On the authority of the powers invested in my by the court–I close this
theatre!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Why so?</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: For lewdness and unshamefacedness! For
displaying a female on the public stage!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: Not him. her.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: He’s a woman!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: That’s who I meant! This theatre is closed!
Notice will be posted!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Nobody knew!</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: He did! I saw him kissing her bubbies!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Closed! Closed, mark you, Henslowe!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: It is over.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be
an actor. I am sorry, Will.</p>
<p><strong>wabash</strong>: Y-y-y-you w-w-w-were w-w-w-w- wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: I would have been good�I would have been
great.</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: So would I. We both would.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Lambert!</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: Well, Burbage–you never did know when your
scene was over.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: That can wait. The Master of the Revels
despises us for vagrants, tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But my
father, James Burbage, had the first licence to make a company of
players from Her Majesty, and he drew from poets the literature of the
age. Their fame will be our fame. So let them all know, we are men of
parts. We are a brotherhood, and we will be a profession. Will
Shakespeare has a play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is yours.</p>
<p><strong>romeo and juliet</strong>: with Mr. Fennyman as the
Apothecary</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Will!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: We’ll be needing a Romeo</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: My ship is moored at Bankside, bound for
Virginia on the afternoon tide–please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps, you
are gaining a colony.</p>
<p><strong>de lesseps</strong>: And you are gaining five thousand
pounds, my lord�by these drafts in my hand.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Would you oblige me with fifty or so in
gold?–just to settle my accounts at the dockside?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Ah!–Look, she comes!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Good morning, my lord. I see you are open for
business so let’s to church.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: My lord!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Be good to her, my lord!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: God bless you!</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Thank you. Let go, there’s a good nurse.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: The tide will not wait. Farewell!</p>
<p><strong>makepeace</strong>: Licentiousness is made a show, vice is
made a show, vanity and pride likewise made a show! This is the very
business of show</p>
<p><strong>“romeo.”</strong>: FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary’s cap
in hand.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: Is this all right?</p>
<p><strong>wabash</strong>: T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike in
d-d-d-dignity.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: We are lost.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: No, it will turn out well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How will it?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: I don’t know, it’s a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>wabash as the chorus</strong>: T-t-t-t-two</p>
<p><strong>wabash as the chorus</strong>: “�Household both alike in
dignity From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, Where civil blood makes
civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair
of star- cross’d lovers take their life, Whose misadventured piteous
overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife�”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>wabash</strong>: W-w-w-was it g-g-g-good?</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: from THE WINGS:</p>
<p><strong>john hemmings as sampson</strong>: “Gregory, on my word we’ll
not carry coals.”</p>
<p><strong>james hemmings as gregory</strong>: “No, for then we should

approaches WILL, nervously.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Master Shakespeare</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Luck be with you, Sam. Sam�?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could
do it yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Parting is such sweet sorrow�”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Another little problem.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: The show must � you know</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Juliet does not come on for twenty pages.
It will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How will it?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>armitage as abram</strong>: “Do you bite your thumb at us,
sir?”</p>
<p><strong>john hemmings as sampson</strong>: “I do bite my thumb,
sir.”</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Can we talk?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: We have no Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: No Juliet?!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: No Juliet?!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: it will be all right, madam.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: What happened to Sam?</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Thomas Kent!</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: Do you know it?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Every word.</p>
<p><strong>philip as lady capulet</strong>: “Nurse, where is my
daughter? Call her forth to me.”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Now by my maidenhead at twelve year
old, I bade her come. What, lamb. What ladybird.”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “God forbid. Where’s this girl?</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “What, Juliet!”</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “How now, who calls?”</p>
<p><strong>ralph as nurse</strong>: “Your mother.”</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “Madam. I am here, what is your
will?</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: We will all be put in the clink.</p>
<p><strong>henslowe</strong>: See you in jail.</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: “Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua’s Law
Is death to any he that utters them.” Then him. Then me.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn as mercutio</strong>: “I am hurt.</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: Courage man. The hurt cannot be
much.</p>
<p><strong>alleyn a mercutio</strong>: Ask for me tomorrow and you shall
find me a grave man.”</p>
<p><strong>alleyn as mercutio</strong>: “�–Why the devil came you
between us? I was hurt under your arms.”</p>
<p><strong>actor as benvolio</strong>: “Romeo, away, be gone! The
citizens are up and Tybalt slain. Stand not amazed. The prince will doom
thee death If thou art taken. Hence, be gone away!”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “I am fortune’s fool!”</p>
<p><strong>actor as benvolio</strong>: “Why dost thou stay!”</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am fortune’s fool.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You are married?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: If you be married, my gave is like to be my
wedding bed. The implication of her silence fills the air. WILL does not
move.</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “Art thou gone so?</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: Love, lord, ay husband, friend, I
must hear from thee every day in the hour, For in a minute there are
many days. O, by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold
my Romeo�”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “�Farewell�”</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “O think’st thou we shall ever meet
again�? Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, As one dead in the
bottom of a tomb. Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest pale.”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “Trust me, love, in my eyes so do
you. Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu. Adieu”</p>

poison–”</p>
<p><strong>fennyman as apothecary</strong>: “Such mortal drugs I have
but Mantua’s law is death to any he that utters them!”</p>
<p><strong>fennyman as apothecary</strong>: “My poverty but not my will
consents.”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “I pay thy poverty and not thy
will.”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “Eyes, look your last! Arms, take
your last embrace! and lips, Oh you The doors of breath, seal with a
righteous kiss A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come, bitter
conduct; come, unsavory guide! Thou desparate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!”</p>
<p><strong>will as romeo</strong>: “Here’s to my love O true
Apothecary.”</p>
<p><strong>fennyman</strong>: I was good. I was great.</p>

<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “�Where is my lord?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Dead!</p>
<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “What here? A cup clos’d in my true

<p><strong>viola as juliet</strong>: “�O happy dagger</p>
<p><strong>the prince</strong>: “For never was a story of more woe Than
this of Juliet and her Romeo.”</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: I arrest you in the name of Queen
Elizabeth!</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: Everybody! The Admiral’s Men, The
Chamberlain’s Men and everyone of you ne’er-do-wells who stands in
contempt of the authority invested in me by her Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>burbage</strong>: Contempt? You closed the Rose–I have not
opened it.</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: That woman is a woman!</p>
<p><strong>alleyn</strong>: What?! A woman?! You mean that goat?!</p>
<p><strong>tilney</strong>: I’ll see you all in the clink! In the same
of her Majesty Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Tilney�!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Have a care with my name, you will wear it
out.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: The Queen of England does not attend
exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of joint. Come here,
Master Kent. Let me look at you.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Yes, the illusion is remarkable and your
error, Mr. Tilney, easily forgiven, but I know something of a woman in a
man’s profession, yes, by God, I do know about that. That is enough from
you, Maser Kent. If only Lord Wessex were here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He is, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Your Majesty</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: There was a wager, I remember�as to whether a
play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it
today. You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?</p>
<p><strong>webster</strong>: I liked it when she stabbed herself, your
Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Master Shakespeare. Next time to you come to
Greenwich, Come as yourself and we will speak some more. WILL bows
deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The waves part for her.</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Your Majesty!</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to
end?</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: As stories must when love’s denied–with tears
and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put
asunder.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife
in the play- house–go make your farewell and send her out. It’s time to
settle accounts. How much was the wager?</p>
<p><strong>wessex</strong>: Fifty shillings. Pounds.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Give it to Master Kent. He will see it
rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: And tell Shakespeare something more cheerful
next time for Twelfth Night.</p>
<p><strong>queen</strong>: Too late, too late.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My Lady Wessex?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will,
for the poet of true love.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for
dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: It was we ourselves did that. And for my life
to come I would not have it otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: If my hurt is to be that you will write no
more, then I shall be the sorrier.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth
Night.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest
wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: An excellent beginning Let him be�a duke. And
your heroine?</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Sold in marriage and half way to America.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: At sea, then–a voyage to a new world?�she
lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the
duke�Orsino.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Orsino�good name</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him
dressed as a boy</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: and thus unable to declare her love</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: But all ends well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: How does it?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: I don’t know. It’s a mystery</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: You will never age for me, nor fade, nor
die.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Nor you for me.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: Good bye, my love, a thousand times good
bye.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Write me well.</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: My story starts at sea�a perilous voyage to an
unknown land�a shipwreck</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: the wild waters roar and heave�the brave
vessel is dashed all to pieces, and all the helpless souls within her
drowned</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: all save one � a lady</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: whose soul is greater than the ocean � and her
spirit stronger than the sea’s embrace � not for her watery end, but a
new life beginning on a stranger shore</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: It will be a love story � for she will be my
heroine for all time</p>
<p><strong>will</strong>: and her name will be � Viola.</p>
