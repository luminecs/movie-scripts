<h1 id="someone-to-watch-over-me">someone-to-watch-over-me</h1>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo
with his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new gold
detective’s SHIELD pinned to his jersey.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: wife, for a family</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: ELLIE, MIKE’S wife of fifteen years, a local
product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man. She
frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack
on the lips as he hooks her into his arms.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: No joke? You’re being transferred to the
19th as your first assignment? Who the hell loves your ass downtown?</p>
<p><strong>rookie</strong>: What’s the 21st?</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: What d’you care? You’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Manhattan. The Upper East Side, East 59th
to 96th.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Remember Curran from the Sixteenth? He
posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy. He
met Jackie Kennedy.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Curran, that fuckin’ noodlehead. He
probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller’s
doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss! I’m so proud of you!
What the hell took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey, don’t ask me. Ask the man who put in the
good word.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: If T.J. didn’t push for me, I never would’ve
made it.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Bet your ass… I give you six weeks before
you’re back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Appreciate, that vote of confidence,
Brook.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Hey, am I supportive, or what?</p>
<p><strong>angle on tommy</strong>: in the hallway, trying to show
SCOTTY’S date – a “real” BIMBO, who’s spilling out of her woolly sweater
and tight jeans – how to stand on his SKATEBOARD. She shrieks a laugh,
toppling off. HELEN, passing by with an empty platter, catches the
action.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He left Elaine for that?</p>
<p><strong>wife #1</strong>: And what about little Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’d like to tie her tits together.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: That wouldn’t be too difficult.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I bet you think she doesn’t have a brain in
her head. I bet you think the only thing he sees in her is one
incredible, dynamite body…</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I love your husband, Ellie, but he’s a real
dork.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Yeah, but he’s my dork.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We’re goin’. Get some sleep, Detective Keegan.
You got a new job tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Think I should put the skateboard in bed with
him?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Too kinky.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ellie, you know I think it’s about time we got
outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Amen to that. The supermarket’s full of
assholes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Take my advice, don’t buy any…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My ass if falling.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Your what…?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: My ass is falling. It is.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn’t look
like my ass anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get in bed.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises
on TV in the morning… gravity…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You got a great ass! I love your ass – now get
that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tomorrow, I start looking for our house… You
love me?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You got no idea…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Imagine… I’m sleepin’ with a DT.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Hi… nice to see you… thank you… my
pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>a met benefactress</strong>: Thank you so much for agreeing
to host us tonight. It’s really extraordinary!</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Glad I could be of help.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Claire!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hello, Win.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know Neil Steinhart?</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Of the filthy rich Steinharts? Why is it Claire
always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: This gives new meaning to the word
nightlife.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: C’mon, let’s get outa this lowbrow rag trade…
You don’t mind, do you?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Venza…</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Skiddy and Kit? I haven’t seen them since that
shitty pasta dinner on the cape.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They’ve got two monsters now. Both boys.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: And so what’s with Steinhart? Is it
serious?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You didn’t like him?</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Looks a little constipated to me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s called “solid”… Nice to find someone
you can count on, Win.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: The main floor stays public. The side rooms we
try to keep available for special functions like tonight.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It’s terrific Win.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: You still writing the occasional magazine
article?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Then c’mon. Follow me. The art’s in the
basement, you’re going to get a privileged peek.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Claire!</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Just press the button all the way down when
you’re ready, okay?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Where’s she go?</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Probably found somebody nicer… Kidding. You’re
great.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: You’re in overtime, Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I will… I promise…</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: You need money, you come to me.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Who the fuck do you think you are, raising
cash without coming to me?</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Your ex-partner… I’m buying you out, Joey. Read
the contract. There’s ample provision.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Fuck the contract!</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Two years ago you were begging me for the
money. Nobody would’ve touched you…</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: You’re making an eighty percent return. Which
is what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Don’t turn away when I’m talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Grease and water still don’t mix, Joey.</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Jesus Christ… are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Joey!</p>
<p><strong>win</strong>: Jesus…!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: T.J…? Is this a joke? Are you kidding me? Give
me 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Switch the light off on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh…
How do you like it so far?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Right behind you, T.J.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Did you ever hear the chatter. They’re worse
than fuckin’ four- year-olds… Miller, let’s clear this path here, all
right?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Blood bath downstairs. The owner of this
place is dead. And I got a witness, and a suspect… Joey Venza.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Where’s Venza?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Nice question. I like questions like
that.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Who’s Joey Venza?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Bad fuckin’ news. Even the families dropped
him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands. But he knows
where a lot of bodies are buried. It’d cap it for Garber if he could
bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Okay, let’s find out what we know. Herd’m up
and check’m out. Anybody know more than gossip about the deceased or
Venza, I wanna talk to them myself. Go.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Okay, will all the beautiful people shut the
fuck up, before it starts gettin’ real ugly here!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Keegan, go baby-sit the witness. Just sit
and look impressive. Make her feel protected. And if you can get her
boyfriend outa my hair, I’ll promote you to fuckin’ Joint Chiefs…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Quit playing with yourself, Keegan. I know who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: A Detective’s supposed to identify
himself.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Are you in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, sir…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I asked for the man in charge…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he’s very
busy upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Don’t tell me he’s “busy”. I asked for an
ambulance for this woman and…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Is she injured?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re not going to talk to anyone without a
lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She’s not a suspect, sir, she’s a witness.
Could I ask you to step outside, please.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: No, I will not step outside.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it’s
standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here,
could you please leave.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I don’t really see what that has to do
with…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Neil, do what he says.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike and neil</strong>: at a standoff.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’ll be right outside.</p>
<p><strong>angle change</strong>: CLAIRE and MIKE alone. He sits down. A
beat.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Can I get you a cup of coffee or
something?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ve never seen anyone killed before.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s okay… I’ve never been a detective before
either…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’ll go slow. Okay? We’ll get through it
together.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I don’t know how you did it, but whatever it
was, keep doing it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I just sat and listened.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Safe and secure is how we want her. Until
she I.D.’s Venza.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Venza’s either going to skip or try to get
to her and Venza likes it here. I want her ass covered, 24 hour
protection, but I don’t want her to know there is any real danger.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I don’t like what I’m hearing…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t understand. If there’s any danger, why
not just level with her…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: T.J. your friend’s a little dense. When she
realizes there’s a killer tryin’ to shut her up, she’ll be on the next
plane for Tahiti… somehow I think my way is better.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Chief?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why not Patrol? They’d do just as good a
job.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: When I want your advise, Keegan, I’ll make
an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I’m a
fuckin’ slug! I got a ‘choice’ at all.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Do it, or look for another profession. That’s
a choice I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You in this with me?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah! Seniority gets the day shift.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Tommy! Goddamnit! Get these skateboards off
the goddamn kitchen floor!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: What’re we having?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: My special, scrambled eggs surprise.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Scrambled eggs surprise?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: So how’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not great. I’ve got a babysitting job for a
material witness on a homicide.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: ’Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day
shift… You know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>close on ellie</strong>: she sits, realizing, upset, but
taking it in stride, now putting plates on the table.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Well, I’ll live with it, I’ve lived with it
all my life. My Dad was a cop, he said, “whatever you do, honey, never
go out with a cop”. So, what did I do? I got a job with the cops. Then I
married a cop. I probably gave birth to a cop. Tommy! Come over here and
eat, it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe you and Tommy should stay with my
Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Don’t start… The only reason is that the
neighborhood’s shi… … crummy. I just don’t like the idea of leaving you
alone here at night.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I can still use a gun.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Keep what handy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: The gun? It’s in the upstairs closet.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How do you know where the gun is?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I know where everything is.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Except the goddamn skateboards, which are
everywhere! I’d like to kill the guy who invented those things.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Lay back, Mack.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Lay back, Mack!! What’s this “lay back, Mack?”
Where does he get this?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Keep the weekends for us, huh? Get a
replacement for Saturday nights. That’ll give us the weekends
together.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: God! Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are
pickles…! God!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Just “lay back, Mack”… lay back…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You remember Detective Keegan?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I want to make sure that everyone respects the
privacy of Miss Gregory’s household. You’re limited to the outer
vestibule, so you can watch the elevator, the kitchen, so you can get
something to eat, and the washroom.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So you can take a shit.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not Koontz.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Be happy. He’s good at this.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: We’d like to, just once, get a look at the
entire layout, so we can evaluate security.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This really isn’t necessary. The security in
this building is about the best in the city.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I’m sure you’re right, Miss Gregory, but I’d
consider it a favor if you’d let us look around.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Guys.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What about when she goes out?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Discourage it. But stay with her if you
can’t. Call it in first so we can have a car on tail. She’s agreed to
travel only with her own driver and limousine… okay, let’s check it
out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Why an I reminded of the Three Stooges?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You a vegetarian? Miss Gregory’s a vegetarian,
so I’m gonna put food for you people in a separate fridge. You know how
to use a microwave? Just about everything you’d want will heat up by
turning this to ninety seconds.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuckin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: He see T.J., or what he thinks is T.J.,
reflected among the other reflections at the other end of the room. Sees
T.J. sit on edge of bed. MIKE is standing in center of the MIRRORS,
slightly disoriented. And T.J. sees him, similarly astounded, MOVING OUT
OF SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: Moving inward, he gawks at the racks
of clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush fabrics. CLAIRE’S
VOICE – ANGRY, ALMOST TREMBLING, A FIRM EFFORT OF WILL – rustles the
silence behind him.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This is my dressing room, and these are my
clothes. I understand your responsibilities… but I’d appreciate you
staying out of here at all times.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: chastened, nods.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sorry. Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Straight ahead.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hard to find doors in this place.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: embarrassed, apologetic.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … Detective Keegan, I hope you understand
how upsetting this is?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: … just saying you should think twice about
it…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … I don’t want to talk about it…</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: book under his arm, quietly moving
toward the SOURCE: the DEN. It’s door is slightly ajar; there is a
suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … You know, and I know, that the only thing
standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my
testimony at his trial…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Claire…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … He killed Win… he enjoyed it…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Win made his choices, Claire. We all do –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And I’m making mine.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re dealing with a psychopath. He gets out
of jail in ten years, or five… or ninety days, and you’ll be looking
over your shoulder for the rest of your life…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my
oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can’t just – “let it
go away”!!</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Claire…</p>
<p><strong>return</strong>: MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living
and dining rooms until he’s in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>another angle on mike</strong>: becoming aware that HE’S NOT
ALONE. He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper, not ten feet from
him, in the laundry room, coat on, fluffing her collar, ready to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I like ’em toasty.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mary</strong>: staring at him, amused.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good night, Mr. Keegan.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: You’re here ’til what time?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m relieved at 4:00 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: When you’re through with it, put it back,
please, exactly where you found it, and don’t use the library again. I
have to leave town for a few days. Let’s do everything we can to make
this less of a trial for her, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: thoughtful, leafing through the
Renoir. Like a man making the most of solitary confinement – becoming
aware of a NOISE. Though hard to make out in this windowless capsule, it
is DISTANT THUNDER. It stirs life in him and his eyes wander reflexively
upward, studying the ceiling – then the doors of the apartment, left
slightly ajar.</p>
<p><strong>angle inside the apartment</strong>: CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as
he wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a drawing room.
HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.</p>
<p><strong>angle from his pov</strong>: CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the
light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her – seated,
still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: watching her.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: appearing at the door, in a freshly
pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. He walks across the lawn
towards them.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey! What the hell’re you doin’ to my car?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV.
What d’you think?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think television’s a dangerous thing.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s twenty bucks in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Enough, Tommy! C’mon. Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey. The neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Let ’em eat their hearts out.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I read the article. You didn’t tell me she
was so beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, actually, she looks better than
that.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: See you Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ellie</strong>: as TOMMY comes up and leans against
his mom: both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke. MIKE turns,
his face with grease on it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in
a suit.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Nice threads Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>angle from his pov</strong>: CLAIRE coming toward – clearly
dressed for the evening, her stride signaling determination.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m not sure how this works. I
have to go out… is that all right?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I have to pick something up before
Bergdorf’s closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think, maybe, that isn’t such a great
idea…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Lieutenant Garber said that in all
likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Right. That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Can we go then?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m supposed to call in.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: There’s a phone in the car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you have another tie? Something more
conservative?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh… Yes… I don’t have it with me. It’s at
home.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What’s the number?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic. Fucking
shopping. I don’t see that we have much choice. Jesus Christ. Tell her
she’s a fucking lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: He thinks you’re being a little careless. He
made the point several times.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You live in Manhattan?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Queens… You know Queens?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: My father founded a music school there. The
Milton Gregory School.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m supposed to speak at their tenth
anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Nice. Maybe you’ll stop by… have an
aperitif…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Don’t move it.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.</p>
<p><strong>perfume lady</strong>: Hello, Miss Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>dark-suited man</strong>: I’m sorry… I thought this was
down…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Are you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Would you wrap it for me, I’ll be back in a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Could you come with me please.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Would you pick one out, please?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Beg pardon?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Since you’re going to be my escort, you’ll
need a new tie.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Put it on my account, please.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I got money.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: If we had more time we’d work on the suit
too.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You look quite elegant, actually.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: My wife likes this suit.</p>
<p><strong>close on claire</strong>: his vulnerability makes her
smile.</p>
<p><strong>traffic cop</strong>: Bring it in, close.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m on duty.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What kind of work? Gigolo?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You can touch me, I won’t bite.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not too sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: CLAIRE! Claire! Darling! Are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: My God! I couldn’t believe… my poor darling…
and Win Hockings…! Antonia’ll be so happy you’re here, she says a
“Lifetime Achievement Award” is like being invited to your own funeral
while you’re still alive…</p>
<p><strong>antonia</strong>: Claire…!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wouldn’t have missed it, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>antonia</strong>: You look so beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned
to protect me. Antonia Bolt…</p>
<p><strong>marge</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike
Keegan…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hello… … Ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>antonia</strong>: He’s got nice eyes. Very gentle. And he
blushes. I like that. Take good care of her.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG
THING come up to him; just “oozing” seduction.</p>
<p><strong>pretty young thing</strong>: I hear you’re a policeman.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Uh, yeah. I’m a policeman.</p>
<p><strong>pretty young thing</strong>: Ever shot anyone?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pretty young thing</strong>: Does it make you… hard?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: … Hard?</p>
<p><strong>pretty young thing</strong>: Erect. You know, a “boner?” I’d
heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Would you excuse me, please?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Would you consider leaving here pretty
soon?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: People think I’m stepping out on Neil. We’re
causing quite a scandal.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey! There are crazy people here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Let’s get a drink.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ah… I shouldn’t… on duty.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll have a spritzer, order something soft
for yourself… I must go for a pee.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll come with you.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I think I can probably do that on my
own.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: Not amused. CLAIRE heads to the
ladies’ room across from the bar. MIKE watches her enter. Turns back to
the bar, which is very busy and confused.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Gimme a spritzer, and a… vodka martini.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Make it a double.</p>
<p><strong>pretty young thing</strong>: You know what? I don’t think
you’re a policeman at all. I think you’re just some schmuck who uses
that “policeman” line as a come-on.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Christ, you’re one beautiful woman. I could
kill you right now, but I’m not gonna… ’cause you’re gonna help me.
You’re gonna see me in a police line-up and say it wasn’t me. And if you
don’t do that, someone will come after you. They’re gonna find you dead,
with your face missing – understood… Good… Because otherwise, it’d be
this easy.</p>
<p><strong>close on claire</strong>: her eyes wide with TERROR. He rubs
his thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Now walk outta here. And if you ever see me
again… you never saw me before.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man
moving out of the ladies’ room. Stunned, MIKE PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING
IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies’ room.</p>
<p><strong>outside the ladies’ room</strong>: Two women just go in. MIKE
pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him. The OTHER WOMEN GASP,
seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE,
disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and face, but
otherwise uninjured.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Take care of her!</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR. These is
only one place for it to go – DOWN. MIKE CHANGES DIRECTION and
FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP trying to keep pace with the
descent of the elevator. At the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS
OPEN and VENZA</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike: mike hurtles down the ramp and
desperately</strong>: FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and
OUT the</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Venza!</p>
<p><strong>angle on venza</strong>: untroubled, turning; raising his
arms, and SMILING.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: confused – seeing that the man VENZA
stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he’d stopped to give himself up.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: breathless as he moves toward VENZA.
MIKE frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: But I got him! He’s in jail! Wasn’t that the
point…?!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You apprehended him after he gave himself up
–</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It wasn’t a bad bust. He gave himself up
because he knew I was gonna nab him.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Anyone who turns himself in makes a good
case for bail.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Even Joey Venza?!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: He’s got a good lawyer, and he made a smart
move. We’ve got a scared witness and a suspect who proved “good will” by
turning himself in.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What about when she identifies him?!</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: If she identifies him. Where the fuck were
you anyway, cowboy! Venza was meat. He walked right past you, and now
we’re the ones playing catch-up! You better hope she identifies him.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: The real estate lady left, she couldn’t wait
anymore. What took you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh, some shit.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What shit, honey?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t want to hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: … Look at the fireplace. You don’t get
workmanship like that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Ninety-seven five. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Honey. You got him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know that Ellie. He might get out.
Garber’s not bein’ straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit
if she identifies him, and it’s my job to convince her she won’t be.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: She’s got to identify him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Because the the only way to stop crime is to
identify criminals. I can’t believe you’re talking this way Mister
Detective – I think she’s got a lot of guts.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think – she’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’d identify him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I might stop you.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Oh I can see you’ve had a bad day. We’ll see
the house another time, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No! No! I’m sorry. Ninety-seven five
right?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Where’d you get the tie?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Bought it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s not your taste.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did she say the down payment was?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She didn’t like the other one, so she picked
this one.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: She took you shopping for a tie?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I had to follow her to a store.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’s wrong with your paisley tie?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ellie, it was a formal party…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Excuse me! You went to a party with her?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m her bodyguard, goddamnit…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I know you’re her bodyguard. Did she buy it
or did you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She bought it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know why she bought me a tie! – She’s
a generous person – and she’s a nice person – and I could be settin’ her
up to be killed… you want the fuckin’ tie?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: No, I don’t want the ‘fuckin’” tie – I’m
sorry – I’m glad she bought you a tie. You needed one. You look good in
that tie. Next time you two go shopping, maybe you could tell her we
need a new Maytag stackable, double-decker washer and dryer set.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You want to see the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi. Just checking to see if you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I came on at 8:00.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m sorry about what happened.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Listen, that was my fault.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I shouldn’t have listened to you, I should’ve
followed you right into the “can” the way he did.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: If I had known I was going to have company,
he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am
glad he’s in jail.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Lieutenant Garber says when I identify him,
they’re going to lock him up and throw away the key.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I guess I’m supposed to do it in the
morning. Identify him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sooner, the better.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He said he’d kill me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Big talk… Desperate guy.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Right. How could he do that if he’s in jail
and they’ve thrown away the key…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s the right thing to do. Identifying
him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hmm…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You wouldn’t happen to know what language they
speak in India, do you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Urdu and Hindi.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, what a woman.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Didn’t do very well, did you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Nope… never finished one yet. I hate these
things.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You were reading my Renoir.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You put it back in the wrong place… Do you
like Renoir?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They’re kind of fuzzy.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know why they’re like that…? He was
myopic… going blind.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So, this could be your last night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Could be, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Want to go out for a drink? I mean, we’re
both sitting here, and Joey Venza’s in jail…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay
away from someone because they walked a certain way?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Absolutely. Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s the dumbest walk I ever saw!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, no seriously! There’s a study done on
this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And die laughing, because you’re walking so
stupid!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your
business.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Okay. Let’s just see if a mugger gets
me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: … It was like… the minute I saw her… I knew.
She looked so damn adorable in a cop’s uniform… puttin’ on a big, tough
act…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So it was “love”.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. It was.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And “is”…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s nice. And you live in Queens? With a
child, and a dog…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No dog.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I saw you with a dog, in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No dog.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: But “nice”.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What about Neil?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You don’t like him, do you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What’s to like?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Tell it like it is.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You asked.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He’s very caring, in his way. You haven’t
seen him at his best.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You could do better.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll miss you, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>angle on both</strong>: the music playing.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It was nice having you “watch over me”…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. I liked being around you too…
Claire.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: feeling a moment of awkwardness.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the two cops again</strong>: watching them go.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Both captive to indecision. It is he
who makes it, just by staying immobile for too long. She smiles and
takes off her coat, holding it out to him. And in the moment of exchange
is the return to reality.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Good night, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sleep good.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: It’s 3 o’clock in the morning. Where the hell
have you been?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Hey, Mike, tough night.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: I guess it happens, you know? A chick gives
you a ride in her limousine, the next thing she wants is to wear your
clothes… … I heard he had her underpants on his head.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Ease up, Mike. Ain’t nobody gonna tell the
old lady.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: cooling down – then girding himself
for</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Ain’t the first time the taxpayers paid for
a blow-job neither.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Don’t tell me it was “no big deal,” it was
out of line, it makes you look like an asshole, and it makes me look
like an asshole. She’s coming in, in a few minutes to I.D. Venza. If
Steinhart’s with her, I want you to apologize. Let’s get this over
with…</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Okay, we’re gonna have a line-up here…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Good morning, Miss Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It was my fault not Detective Keegan’s, I’m
sorry for all the fuss.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: You all ready?</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Will this take long?</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: They can’t hear you, they can’t see you…
Mr. Venza’s attorney, Mr. Neuman; arresting officer Keegan… Good
luck.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Okay, take a seat… you, put a couple phone
books under your rear…</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Will everyone except number three please
take one step back?</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: on a couch, beer in hand – mindlessly
watching.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Coming to bed?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Few minutes. Want to catch the news.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Should I wait up? We’ve got to get up early
for the beach tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: hitting the remote to SCAN the
channels; troubled.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: They need me back in Miami, but I’d really
like it if you could join me. The marlin fishing’s supposed to be great
off the Keys…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: The change would do you a world of good.</p>
<p><strong>tv newsman</strong>: Denied bail, Joey Venza will remain
behind bars at least until the time of the trial –</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: At least now we can get on with our own
lives.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey, not yet! How many times…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: God, it’s freezin’ out there.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Wait a sec.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hello. Yes, just a second. It’s the Whip.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey Lieutenant, how are you…? What?! Venza’s
out. Why didn’t the I.D. unit or the D.A.’s office know about his sheet?
Ah shit… Yeah, yeah, okay I’m on my way in.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the
Bronx, thirteen months ago. It’s coming to court and the judge let him
walk because of the pending case law.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Mike, take it easy…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it
coming.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: It’s not your fault. Mike, please get off the
case.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It is my fault! I’m responsible for her!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Did you hear what I said?!!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m due on at seven.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re not going to the game, are we Mom?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Sure we are, let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>angle from his pov</strong>: CLAIRE’S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra
SECURITY – A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: She’s a little upset. You’re going to have
to piss in a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Sorry, I don’t have any extras. Have a nice
night.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Open the door, will you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I can’t open it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s just me. I want to talk to you. Let me
in…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You put me life in danger.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, you’ll be safe. We’re gonna pick him up
again…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: And then what? I’ll never be safe. I’ll have
to leave the country! You can’t protect me, and you can’t keep him in
jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time!</p>
<p><strong>he pushes it open, entering the apartment, camera</strong>:
FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her. The MUSIC, bounding off the high
ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You told me I’m safe? I’m going for a walk
in the park.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire, will you calm down?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m perfectly calm, I’m a normal human
being. I’m going for a walk in the park.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire…!</p>
<p><strong>angle on claire</strong>: as she heads down the hall moving
fast, he’s right behind her.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Stop, will you?!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Let go!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Stop being nuts!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I trusted you! I thought you cared about
me?!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I do care about you!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of
odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One
month? A couple of days?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Easy… easy… I’m not gonna leave you alone like
this…</p>
<p><strong>angle on claire</strong>: gasping as she clings to him.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m not gonna let anything happen to you…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: She turns in the darkness to look at the
clock. Heart beating, she reclines again, lying awake, realizing what it
was that woke her. She listens, hearing it again.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Only silence answers.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There’s somebody outside…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We’re gonna need snow boots.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Calm down, everything is okay. Ellie
reported a prowler. Probably one of those peepers who’ve been making
this neighborhood such a pleasure…</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: We all look like hell.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Well, there you are… I’ll come ’round in
the car from time to time so you can get some sleep. Just keep the
shades pulled.</p>
<p><strong>brooklyn</strong>: Thanks for the coffee.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Thanks. You’re terrific.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m sorry. I know I heard noises… the
detective’s wife…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I want you and Tommy to stay with my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous… That’s all I need,
rubbing up against your mother and grandmother every day… I can take
care of myself… C’mon, let’s go to bed… we all need some sleep…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: C’mon, don’t make an issue of it. Do you want
the fucking meatloaf or not?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: D’you have to say “fucking” every other
word?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Jesus, Mike, somebody’s been feeding you a
line of crap.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What’re you talking about –</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m talking about I’ve been talking this way
for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it’s vulgar!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tight jeans, workshirt, scarf tied around her
head, she looks great. She looks up, rinsing a greasy grill over a
bucket of hot water, playfully sprays the window with the hose, seeing
him watching her.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Is everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They called here after you left…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She’s okay. Everything’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know you…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This is me, Mike. There’s nothing else…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t wash your clothes at the Boulevard
Laundromat… you don’t pick up your kids from some crummy public school…
what is this? A fuckin’ joke?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Okay, then let’s make it easy. It was a
mistake. Don’t make me feel guilty now that it’s over, let’s forget
about it.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don’t you think I know what this is doing. I
know you have a wife. I know you have a family… I’m not asking for
anything. I don’t want anything… Just please hold me I’m scared…</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Mike…?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Oh, man. I don’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: All fucked up, T.J.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You gotta get another tour. We’re gettin’ too
old for this.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m not saying it’s your fault.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did you do tonight?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I watched TV.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did you watch?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t remember Michael, go to sleep. You
don’t have to make conversation with me.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’ll make a reservation tomorrow for early
dinner. You can sleep till noon.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens
Early-Bird Special… Did you see Tommy today? He misses you…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well. This’ll be over soon. Venza’s such a nut
job, we’re bound to pick him up soon.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’d like you to switch to the day shift,
Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner…
That’s why he’s on the morning shift.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well, T.J.’s… seniority… and all. I’ll talk to
Garber about it.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife,
and she talked to him…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You talked to his wife?</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: My wife talks to his wife about what shift I’m
gonna take?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Unless there’s some particular reason why it
feels better to be around her at night.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Is there, Mike?</p>
<p><strong>close on ellie</strong>: sensing deception. Her eyes begin to
glisten.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: seeing her distress. Unable to hide
his own.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What, what is it? Is it serious or what…?
Quit looking at me like that! What’s with this ridiculous silence?!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Goddamn. I never thought this would happen to
me… you fuckin’ sonofabitch…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I just want you off the case. Get off it, or
don’t come home. And I want you to remember… when we’re old… that when
this awful thing happened… I behaved like a lady. The kind of “lady” you
apparently prefer.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: We got some specials.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let me drive…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Get away from me… get away! She means that
much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me.
Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: El? I’m sorry. I do love you. And you are a
lady. I have so much respect…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: You fucker! Don’t tell me how much respect
you have! You dumb mother fucking FUCKER! Now get off this case or don’t
come home!!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey, T.J.? Yeah, listen, I need a huge favor
from you, man. I know Helen doesn’t like you to miss dinner, but I need
you to switch shifts with me tonight. Just “personal”. I don’t know what
the hell I’m doin’, I need some time to think. Look, do it or don’t do
it, but spare me the fuckin’ lecture, all right?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as he LOPES INTO THE PARK.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING
that’s “RED”; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into the
park. A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing to a stop behind
him, its back door slowly swinging open, engulfing our sight of him…</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: I know sweetheart… we have enough flowers
here.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting.</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: No, no, sweetheart… not here… get going…
Okay.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the
JOGGER slip by and her mission accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>vietnamese girl</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>the girl</strong>: slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as
she skips off.</p>
<p><strong>close on claire</strong>: surprised to see it’s T.J.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Detective Keegan is… Mike… “Michael” asked me
to tell you he’s under the weather.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: She handles it, crestfallen.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: He’ll probably take the morning shift.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: He’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah, just… bad gut. Y’know.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up
at the windows of CLAIRE’S apartment.</p>
<p><strong>angle up to claire</strong>: SILHOUETTED in the distant
window.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied,
getting into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Tell me I’m dreamin’.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I just gotta talk to her, T.J.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: as always, AFFECTED BY HER.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: T.J. agreed to take my shift. He knows about
us.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: So does Ellie.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You told her?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What do you want to do?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You’re tired. Let me watch over you
tonight…</p>
<p><strong>angle inside the kitchen</strong>: CLOSE on the murderous
paraphernalia left on the kitchen table, being assembled by the
“JOGGER”.</p>
<p><strong>closer angle</strong>: THE BUTTON of the ELEVATOR being
PUSHED by a GLOVED HAND. It activates a “HUM.”</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: on the other side of the door, listening.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Put it down! Think about it!</p>
<p><strong>in the bedroom</strong>: CLAIRE wakes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: checking quickly on the dead assassin,
flattens himself against the wall and scurries back through the bath the
way back into the BEDROOM.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get on the floor! There may be more!</p>
<p><strong>close on his face</strong>: twisting with GRIEF.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Live, T.J. Please…!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get security on the phone! Emergency!</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: shirtless and shoeless, on his knees
in T.J.’S blood, desperately pumping his chest.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ambulance! Ambulance! He’s got a
heartbeat…!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They’re operating on him. He’s still
alive.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: I heard a lot… Anything you want to deny,
Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It should’ve been me…</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: aware of his own dilemma.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Then it would’ve been her, too. I don’t
know… but I gotta protect the Precinct, too. You’re on suspension,
pending Disciplinary Hearings. Don’t hold your breath. And you’re not to
go near that woman until she’s no longer under Police protection and
this case is closed.</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: responding with a silent nod as
GARBER stands looking down at him.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Is it “love,” Mike? I hope so. I want it to
be worth it, for your sake.</p>
<p><strong>closer angle</strong>: MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other
across the gulf of their collective misery.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m going to visit my sister for a few days.
I’d like you to get your stuff out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What about Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He’ll live through it. They all live through
it. What a world, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Was it Venza? Did you get him?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: What a shame.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: You see a couple of the parties that go on
at this place, you’ll realize that marriage is an institution whose time
has come and gone.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays, and every
other weekend. And know what? Our relationship’s never been better.</p>
<p><strong>scotty</strong>: Make it home, Mike…</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: I’m no saint, Claire, but I do love you. I can
understand the pressure of the circumstances… but what about when it’s
over? Are you going to feel the same way about him? Is he going to move
in here and do shift work at the 21st if they’ll have him back. Think
this through Claire. This is the rest of your life we’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I have thought it through, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>neil</strong>: Call me if anything changes. I love you,
Claire.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Unbelievable, man, the fuckin’ jogger… they
found him in Atlantic City, totally drugged out and still jogging…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hello? Mike. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you
at the precinct.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ve moved into Scotty’s… Good news about
T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull
through.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh God, that’s great!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh, I’m fine. They’ve replaced you with
quite an entourage. It’s a regular “marching band”. You should see me on
the street, you’d think I was the First Lady –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m taking them all out to Queens, as a
matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There’s an event at my
Father’s school… an anniversary… I thought maybe you could come…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh that thing in Queens.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going away after that, the next
morning.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Pretty far. I’m told not to say anything
about it on the phone, in case it’s tapped… they think it’s best, safer,
if I go away, at least till Venza’s found.</p>
<p><strong>close one mike</strong>: absorbing it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: When can I see you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know. Garber’s left orders here not
to let you in the building.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: beat.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Tomorrow night. Can you come?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know. It wouldn’t be very smart.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Listen, you’re right. Don’t do it. I’ll
just… send you an address, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No really, it’s okay, I’ve gotta go. I’m
expecting some calls. I’ll be fine, really.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll think about Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Tommy!</p>
<p><strong>tommy spots him</strong>: hesitant – slowly approaching the
car.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How are things going, pal?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Okay, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How about dinner tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mom and I got plans.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What “plans?” You and Mom got “plans?”</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She’s taking singing lessons.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She’s what?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: She met some friend of Aunt Millie’s who
works for a record company. He thinks she’s got a great voice.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What! What kind of pathetic line is that?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re gonna pass the street.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You coming in?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, I’m not coming in. And if you’d rather go
to a “singing lesson” than have dinner with your father…</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re not going to a singing lesson, she’s
just gonna start taking singing lessons.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: So, what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Shooting.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Shooting?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being
alone in this neighborhood. ’Bye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Tommy! The guy’s a sleaze-bag. She can’t
sing.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I don’t think she can sing, either.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Take care, pal.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: MIKE’S CAR LEAVING. TOMMY watches it
until it can be seen no longer, then TURNS, going into the house.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: he gazes after them, then continues
to jog.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Aren’t you supposed to aim at the head?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mom, what’s going to happen with you and
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I don’t know Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey, can we go to McDonald’s?</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: CLAIRE moving through the crowd,
PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible , HER EYES
anxious, scanning the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>giddings</strong>: Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you
came.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It was something my father always liked me
to do.</p>
<p><strong>giddings</strong>: You’re planning to speak?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Not if you don’t want me to.</p>
<p><strong>giddings</strong>: Well, of course, we’d be… honored…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Just putting in an appearance then.</p>
<p><strong>close on her face</strong>: expressionless. But it slowly
gains animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a segue to
something new. It’s “SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME.”</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: returning the smile as he COMES
TOWARD.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Don’t do it, man. I love ya, but you’re out
of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>angle on both</strong>: gazing at each other.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What a memory.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Do you dance?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They guys treatin’ you all right?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ve been doing a lot of thinking.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>close on him</strong>: studying her saddened eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It wouldn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’d miss my life…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … Don’t explain.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How long you going away for?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Long enough.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: “For”…?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: “To”… Forget about you.</p>
<p><strong>close on her</strong>: awash in the nearness of him.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll have to pack a lot of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>angle on mike</strong>: Stopping – as KOONTZ heads quickly
toward.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Brook’s patching a call through to you. He
thought he’d find you here. It sounds urgent.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Baffled.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: He says it’s your son.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: The office down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman #2</strong>: He’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Tommy? What…? What?! Hello? Who is this? Yeah.
I’m listening. No. Nobody but me.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: I’m glad you’re where I expected you to be,
Detective Keegan, ’cause you’re got two minutes to get home or I take
your family out.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I heard you. I’ll do it. Just don’t touch
them.</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: Lemme talk to my son. Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They got my family. I need you guys.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman #1</strong>: Who…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Venza.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: At my house…!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Call a cruiser!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: … Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and
Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Let’s go. We’re takin’ her home! Move it!
Get the cars!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Koontz! I need you guys!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: We’ll call SWAT. We’ll get the locals. Throw
it!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, I need’m now!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Go with him!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: My job is to protect you! This is Koontz
–</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No One-Seventeen, they’ll fuck it up! He told
me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone! He won’t wait,
he knows I’m two minutes away! Koontz, please!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: I can’t do it, you know that… He’s not gonna
allow it anyway, Mike. No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that
house alive, who can finger him.</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman #1</strong>: Hey…!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Mike! Don’t go there…! Then make them come
with you!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They can’t, they’re assigned to you! I’d do
the same thing!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Go get her.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Fuck it, man. Our brother needs us. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Go! Get outta here!</p>
<p><strong>plainclothesman #1</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get OUT!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They’re assigned to me, they’ll have to go
if I come with you!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m not getting out! GO!</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Adams…! C’mon, move it!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Turn off the siren…!</p>
<p><strong>close on claire</strong>: wide-eyed. In silence.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We get there, you get down, stay out of sight.
Don’t get near that house. Understand me? Venza’s not to know you’re
there!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Tommy? Ellie…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m not armed! I’m the only one in here! I can
help you get away if you listen to what I say!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m comin’ in the kitchen! If you fuckin’
shoot me, they’ll come in here, and we’re all dead! You hear me,
Venza?!</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You
didn’t do what I said.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That’s right, you’re gonna do what I say.
Joey. I want to help you out of this.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: You should’a brought the girl.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I brought the girl. She’s outside.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Hold it…!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll prove it!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Mike…?</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Not another word until I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: How do I know that’s her?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll bring her in. You let them go, and I’ll
bring her in.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Why should she come in?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: She trusts me. She’ll do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Bullshit! Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It’s pitch
dark in here! You’re gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come
in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see
you. We want to see your face and we won’t be able to until you get to
the kitchen door!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I want your guarantee they’ll be turned loose
when she opens the front door.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: I get my hostage first. No one’s turned loose
until I say so.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let my kid go.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: I’m not lettin’ no one go.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get that gun away from his head, or I’ll keep
her from coming in! Put the gun on me, he can’t hurt you! He’s tied up!
Put him under the table!</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Don’t you fuckin’ give orders to me…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Put him under the table or I’ll stop her from
coming in.</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: Under the table.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll take his place, all right? Put the gun to
my head.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ellie</strong>: Her widened eyes continuing to
INDICATE “beneath the table”.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Be careful, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>he looks up</strong>: SPOTTING HER GUN, where she’d hidden it
for safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Claire! It’s dark. Watch your step. Come
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>angle on tommy</strong>: trying desperately to get his hands,
tied behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his head. It’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: eyes darting to ELLIE – as the FIGURE
slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND lowering beneath his
knees, within reach of TOMMY, under the TABLE.</p>
<p><strong>angle on tommy</strong>: in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands
managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely attempting to DIG
BENEATH IT – as the FOOTSTEPS continue to APPROACH down the DARKENED
HALL.</p>
<p><strong>angle on the figure</strong>: almost at the kitchen door –
about to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Watch your step!</p>
<p><strong>venza</strong>: What the fuck you doin’?!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: There’s a skateboard in the door!</p>
<p><strong>table. all hell breaks loose. tommy rolls, thrusting
the</strong>: GUN INTO MIKE’S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE
SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM. VENZA LEAPS ASIDE AND
FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in RETURN. MIKE LEAPS FOR
ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR, rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN
ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ellie</strong>: throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS
“PINGING” AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE. The pitch-black
kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES like the Fourth of July, mixed
with the “WHINE” of bullets hitting pots and pans, and the sight of
BODIES hurtling through the dark.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Stay down!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Turn around, fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: Tommy…!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ellie…</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: I’m all right.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Fuckin’ miracle, man.</p>
<p><strong>koontz</strong>: Told you they’d be here in a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>close on claire’s face</strong>: gazing at MIKE, his family
wrapped in his protective embrace. He LOOKS UP, meeting her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Everyone’s all right…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. It’s all over.</p>
<p><strong>closer angle on them</strong>: not knowing quite what to
say.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>angle on both</strong>: their eyes locked into each
other’s.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You still going away?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t have to, now.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I think it’s probably still a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>close on mike</strong>: getting her message.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’ll miss you, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Listen, I’ll… see you again.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I like your coat.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You have a weakness for Lady Cops.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Say goodbye, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You take care.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What do you think? Any chance? There’s nothin’
else I’m any good at, but this.</p>
<p><strong>garber</strong>: Call me next week. We’ll talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Good police work, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>ellie</strong>: He doesn’t want to sleep here. Neither do I.
It’s not my house anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Me neither.</p>
