<p><strong>note</strong>: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPTS CONTAINED SCENE
NUMBERS.:THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.</p>
<p><strong>male nurse</strong>: – how – ?</p>
<p><strong>voice of pathe</strong>: October 11, 1931: Los Angeles!</p>
<p><strong>voice of pathe</strong>: A conflagration of Biblical
proportions incinerates nearly everything and every one inside what was
once Tinsel Town’s most celebrated psychiatric facility: The Vannacutt
Neuropathic Institute. But the secret this inferno burned free was far
more frlghtening than any picture that Hollywood could ever produce!</p>
<p><strong>voice of pathe</strong>: – a Sanitarium of Slaughter
supervised by a surgeon gone mad –</p>
<p><strong>voice of pathe</strong>: – Richard Benjamin Vannacutt –</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: – murdered by his own patients
before every one of them perished in the blaze. Ironically, the only
humans to escape the conflagration –</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: – were five of Vannacutt’s equally
sadistic Staff, all of whom, until the day they died, insisting that
they were only following “Doctor’s Orders.”</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: But our story doesn’t end there.
For, some years later, the gutted interior of the Institute was
refurbished as a private residence. It has yet to be inhabited. Many say
because the spirits of the vile Vannacutt and his Victims still walk the
long corridors inside this place now known, simply, as: “The House On
Haunted Hill.”</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>camera pulls back from a small walnut shrouded
television</strong>: SET… revealing a savagely beautiful young woman,
EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE, sitting like the queen of fucking-England in the
back of her limousine. She’s been watching all this on the 12” TV set
inside the limousine, a look of perverse amusement on her face.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: I’m Christopher Lee. More of
“Terrifying, But True” in just a moment –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No need, baby.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You just gave me exactly what I needed.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Price. Evelyn, how nice… Well, that is
<u><b>fascinating</b></u> – but I’m gonna have to get back to you –
they’re trying to shoot me here.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: My wife. Where were we?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Your roller coaster that is, quote: “unlike
any that has ever come before it.”</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine
Journey To The Brink Of Madness.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Sorry, but it just looks like a generic
roller coaster to me. What’s the gimmick?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20
stories worth of top?</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: And then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think it’s something better experienced
then described.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: After you.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Sources have told this reporter that the
real reason your Park’s opening has been delayed was a near-fatal
accident on one of the rides here. Comment?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I wouldn’t be opening this place tomorrow if
every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn’t tested 100%
safe.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Growing pains: new steel’s gotta bend and
stretch a little before finally settling in.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t worry. In the fifteen year history of
Price Amusements we’ve yet to lose a single customer.</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: First time for everything.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’ve designed and built six of these places –
take my word for it, everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: How long ’til we’re out of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Five, ten seconds, we’re almost to the top
–</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Look: even if, God forbid, something
…unexpected…should happen, there’s always the safety cable –</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: – that does what?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Keeps the cab from just –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – oh, shit –</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Do something!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Like what?? This isn’t supposed to be
happening!!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: OhJesusohChrist!</p>
<p><strong>kirsten</strong>: Please! Something! Oh-God!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Maybe if I –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: From here on, it gets really scary.</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: Room for two more.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alright, Princess: now what were you
babbling?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Congratulations: on a scale of one-to- ten,
you just hit a 73 on the Perversity Meter. I don’t suppose for once we
could just celebrate at some nice, quiet little restaurant –</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: Houston, I think we may have a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something
for a sec.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Problem where? Looked good to me.</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: “Dummy 6” keeps losing his arm.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just
make him a screamer.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Steven!!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Here, dear – with a suggestion –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family
Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think
again. I’m telling you: “Haunted Hill” is exactly where we’re having my
party this year. You’ll find the guest list on your desk by the time you
get back –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You want it, Precious, you got it: the party
of your very short goddamn life.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Uh, Mr. Price? The Dreamworks people
are getting a little…antsy.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Tell ’em I’m right there.</p>
<p><strong>ext. film set - day (we need to re-work this scene
for</strong>: LOCATION)</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: So what the fuck is it?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t know, Ms. Jenzen.</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: Well, who’s the damn thing <u>from</u>?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Messenger just dropped it off. No return
address.</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: You didn’t think to ask?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I was in the middle of –</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: – being utterly fucking useless, what else
is new.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There’s something there on the side –</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: I’m aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: It’s not my goddamn birth –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – I wouldn’t –</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: – no kidding: that’s why you’re making ten
bucks an hour and I’m –</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: Jesus!!</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: You think this is fucking funny??</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No, no, it’s just –</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: – well, here’s a better one: you’re
fired.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: And here’s your goddamn severance!</p>
<p><strong>int. sara’s cubicle - just after (we need to re-work
this</strong>: SCENE FOR LOCATION)</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: …wow….WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen – ?</p>
<p><strong>jenzen</strong>: Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: On my way out. Thanks for the valuable parting
gift.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: The man’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>murder</strong>: Will Be The Entertainment</b></i></p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Don’t get much better than that.</p>
<p><strong>young man’s voice</strong>: Terrific: what’s the catch?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is the end…by car anyway. What with the
’94 quake and El Nino, the driveway’s been pretty much destroyed.
’Shame. Have to hoof it from here.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: If you don’t mind me asking… Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Name’s Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own
the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it.
So…</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Where’s Steven Price and his huge,
throbbing checkbook?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Not with you, is he? Well, I’m sure he’ll
turn up any second now… If you’ll just come along…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I wanna know first: to what do I owe this
honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I’m just the Greeter – and in that
capacity, I now urge you all strongly to –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: But the million bucks each, that’s for
real?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: It better be – he still owes me $25 grand
for renting the place for the night! Here, let’s get you some
illumination so you can make your way safely!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Just point and walk, sis – the place is
right up –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: …there.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: As a tumor.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Wish I could take the credit, but –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – guess we know where Mr. Price is now.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: He must’ve beaten us all here!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: ’Less the place really is haunted.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths
that occurred inside – my own father’s included – all perfectly normal
fatal accidents.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: You better be wrong. I didn’t come all this
way for “normal.”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re totally full of shit, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You’ll never know ’til you walk through
that door!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You wouldn’t consider getting my check
and running it back down here?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Didn’t think so. Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: …Jesus H. Christ.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: So where’s the party?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Looks like we’re it.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: More to the point. Where’s our host?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: More to the point: what in the name of fuck
is that?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: More of Price’s spook-house bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Not at all!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Part of the original structure. When it
was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place – Dr. Vannacutt – found it
“inspirational.” From some German cathedral a million years ago:
“Driving the Demons From the Mind.”</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’m moved beyond words.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: The hint of still weirder shit to come, I
can only hope.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody?
Hello??</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred
decibels, what is your problem?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Problem? No problem – just want to get my
money and get on home – you know, things to see, people to do?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Mr. Price?? Mrs. Price??</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: I knew this whole place’d be pure gold!
Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get
something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting
me some kind’a Robert Stack “Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos” gig.
No more five afternoons a week of sex-change-
Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-’em.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ve got your own TV show?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: The guy whose hair I do has his own TV
show. All I’ve got is a blow-dryer and a dream.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Uh, excuse me – but does anybody know any
logical reason why those little demons would be moving?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: …birds. Just seagulls or something walking
on the glass, goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Cheer up: before the night’s through, I’m
sure one of us’ll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I may start right now.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Who the fuck are all of you??</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Oh…my…God….</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – Jesus, lady! –</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Is she…alright?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I thought she was dead. For sure.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Not even fucking close. Get…off…of…me.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not dead now, but soon.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: She’s been marked for it. The House does
that. Happened to Pritchett’s father. Likely happen to you all. Isn’t
that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I can’t remember at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m impressed: I don’t think Evelyn’s ever
said those words to anything with genitalia.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m not laughing, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You shouldn’t be – you were nearly just
killed, sweetheart. And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let
the games begin!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Haven’t they already?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Sure is a funky old house, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Could we have a word?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh, I think we’re going to have several.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: This’ll just take a moment – you’ll find food
and booze in the main salon, knock yourselves out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did
that?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Of course he did, for God’s sake. Didn’t he,
Mr. Pritchett?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I can’t comment until I get paid.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’m surrounded by idiots.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Mr. <u>Price</u>???</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages
long – where the hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my
own: a group so hungry for money that they’d be willing to do anything.
I thought you’d be more comfortable with your peers.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I guess it was stupid of me not to expect
something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven:
Round One, you win.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, not quite. See, those people down
there: they aren’t the ones I invited.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Then who are they?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You tell me. I don’t know how you managed to
hack into my Mac, but: bravo.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What are you talking about? You think I
invited them?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Sure know it wasn’t me. And if you say it
wasn’t you – then who the hell did, Evelyn?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It you really loved me, Steven, you’d find a
way to drop dead in the next three seconds.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Finding ways for me to die at these things is
really your deal, isn’t it? The “O.J.” knife with the not-quite-
retractable blade? Your “Jim Jones Kool- Aid” that was exactly that?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: All accidents until proven otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You know how happy I’d be if that was really
true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren’t
fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn
time!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Which part of that fantasy turns you on
most: me with other men – or just the other men?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You know everything you do gets me hot.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – just not always in the sexual sense.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’re hurting me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Now, there’s the simple country gal I
married. Let’s go back down and greet your guests – show them the real
you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: My guests were shredded. It’s your sick
little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I’m going to go run scalding water on
the places you just touched me, and then I’m calling a cab.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Mr. Price: I’ve done everything we agreed
on, your guests are all here and in one piece – my 25 thousand now,
please.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five
other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to
cash.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And we get this money when?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The second the sun hits tomorrow morning.
Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you’re still alive, of
course. Any other questions?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Yeah. Why’s there five checks? There’s only
four of us.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re forgetting my lovely wife; she’s part
of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What’re you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to
mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still
amongst the living.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: What are you playing here, Price?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: A very, very scary game. But then look at the
bright side: if there’s only one of you still upright at dawn, you’ll be
leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is nuts.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yeah. But, hey, anybody who’s not
“comfortable” with the rules, you’re free to walk, anytime. Seven digits
poorer, goes without saying.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I’m ready now.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the
damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Two “T”s at the end of the name.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Just for the record: what are the rest of
your names?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Eddie Moses, Communications Attache – which
translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger
service.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: And you, young lady?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.-
Paragon-Pictures.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Very good. Well, I think I can say with
complete honesty: I’ve never heard of any of you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Then what the hell are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: How’d you make your guest list, Price:
throw darts at a phone book?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re not my list.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I got an engraved – literally –
invitation – with my name –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – I’m sure you did.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: This is all maybe getting a little too strange
–</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – I wouldn’t worry, Ms. Jenzen: the
unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the
meantime, let’s all relax, have a drink, the evening’s young –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – it’s getting older by the second.
Mr. Price, if I could just please have –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think you’re gonna miss the bash of a
lifetime –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – my loss –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – even if I give you a million as well?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Wouldn’t know what to do with it all
–</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Please – God-in-Heaven, no –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The windows –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You can’t do this to me!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – NOOOOOOOO!!! –</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Now that is enter-fucking- tainment!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This thing’s going nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: If this is someone’s idea of a joke –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – Pritchett’s not laughing.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Pritchett!!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Blackburn! His hands, do something!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Bottle of vodka on the sideboard: get
it!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Pritchett, what the hell just happened
here?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Lockdown.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: A mechanism. From the old Asylum. For
Emergencies. Sealed the whole place shut. Top to bottom. That’s how come
they all burned to death in ’31. Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch. If he
was gonna die, they all were gonna die, and so they were toast.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: No wonder they’re still pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: The only ones who survived were five of
Vannacutt’s staff butchers.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Why in God’s name wasn’t this thing
removed years ago??</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: It was on my Dad’s list of “things to
do.” But the House did him first.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You said that was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I lied. The House is alive and we’re all
gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Oh, for chrissake –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How
long before this damn thing unseals itself?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Don’t know that it does.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well, then, how ’bout maybe we call
someone?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Hasn’t been a telephone in this House in
over 60 years.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn/price/melissa</strong>: I’ve got my cellular.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well, flip a coin and somebody dial 911!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Won’t do any good.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Must be those plates – interfering with the
signal somehow.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Not the plates: the House. Why is no one
listening to me?? It’s alive! And once it’s made up its mind, it won’t
let anything out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So, what? You’re saying we’re stuck here the
rest of our lives?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: A cleaning crew’s supposed to arrive at
9:30 tomorrow morning – I think the power of the house fades at
dawn.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – well, let’s hear it for small miracles
–</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – but I imagine we’ll all be mutilated
beyond recognition by then.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Goodbye, bad times – hello, Prime Time!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There is something seriously screwed-up going
on here, and I don’t believe it’s about ghosts –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: – oh, it sure ain’t, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Take a bow, Steven, you’ve outdone yourself
tonight – scared holy hell out of even me.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: If that’s the fact, Price, okay, you’ve
had your fun – now open the goddamn –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – asking the wrong guy – wasn’t me who closed
it.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Sure it wasn’t. Hey, anybody else here make
their living with thrills’n’chills for the kiddies? Don’t raise your
hands all at once.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Huh. And here I had a completely different
theory.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Really? Well, let it rip.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh, no-no-no – much more bang for everyone’s
buck to nail the bitch –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – the sadistic prick –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – in the act.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Uh, excuse me? Don’t think I’m not having the
time of my life watching this train wreck that’s your marriage – but
this isn’t what I had in mind… I want to know that we can get out of
here if we need to.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Believe me, we need to.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Pritchett, this “lockdown” thing – it’s gotta
have like a master control – you know machinery, gears, whatever –
somewhere in this place?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: The basement – but, believe me, you don’t
want to go down there.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No, you don’t want to go down there. I am
going down there. And I’m going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this
thing and floor it.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You’ll never find it, it’s a maze down
there.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well, that leaves you with two options then,
doesn’t it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here – or it’s
spend-the-night-sleep-tight.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: It’s actually very easy when you know the
way.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: A word of advice, honey? God knows what kind
of freak-outs Steven’s got set to spring in this place. If I were you,
I’d bring something to protect yourself with. Baby, don’t you think
now’s the time to I break out your “party favors?”</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Must be getting old, Stevie – you’re
repeating yourself – this is the exact same set-up you used for the
Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in ’94. Girlie, open up that casket there and see
what you find.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Ooooh, nice: firearms this time.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: The warped factor here just gets bigger and
bigger.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Steven’s sense of humor just makes you want
to bust a gut, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m in stitches.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The clip’s been welded shut.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: On all of them, probably.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: So how’s a girl to know if these things are
loaded, baby?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. I think we’ll let the young lady have
first crack.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t want a gun, I just want out. Let’s go,
for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’ll meet you down there.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Take the gun.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check
the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: A simple leak, if it’s okay with you.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>pritchett’s voice</strong>: Y’know, this’d actually be funny
– if I didn’t know for a fact I’d be pleading for a quick, painless
death in the next few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sara’s voice</strong>: Could somebody please just gag him or
something?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re a handy little thing to have
around.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And you’re not really as large and useless as
you seem.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m better than that.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Don’t push it.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Now take us where this damn thing’s at.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – hey! Next time give me a couple seconds
notice before you wing a gag like that!</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: The lockdown thing.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I mean, not that it didn’t give Evelyn the
kind of coronary I had in mind, just…</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: – it wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Rewind that.</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: I was just sitting here – it happened. I
had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Then who did??</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: No idea. I didn’t even know the damn thing
still worked!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It works.</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: Maybe it was just its time to finally fall
apart.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No. Somehow – I don’t know how – she did
it.</p>
<p><strong>schecter</strong>: Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down
the basement and your wife’s up in the bedroom the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t take your eyes off her for a second. I
think she just declared War.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We’d’ve been splitsville years ago, with me
the richest single woman in recorded history – but Steven doesn’t
“believe” in divorce.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Not too big on it myself – but then
again, not on marriage either.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh, he’s got no problem with that: I’m his
fourth.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’m confused.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No need for divorce and that messy
division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: All three of his previous wives just up and
died?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Damnedest thing: each one, freaky little
“accidents” –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You should really open this place to the
public, Pritchett – a spa for people without enough stress in their
lives.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I said we shouldn’t come down here. Very
treacherous – physical and metaphysical levels, both. There’ve been no
refurbishments to this part of the house – it’s exactly as it was in
1931.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Good way to get your head blown off.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’ll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Nothing? That seems like quite a door to hold
back “nothing”.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What is it? What’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: The Soul of the House. Everything that’s
corrupt about it… My father trapped it in there just before he died. You
see, he purchased the house to restore it… We were going to live here…
Nothing can live here. I was just a kid… The first time I saw it, I
thought it was beautiful… It was just a dark mist turning into the
corner of the room… then it started to move… then death started to
happen… First the workers.. six in all… then my father…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Ghosts killed your father?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Not ghosts… at least not what you’re
thinking… Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments
somewhere in the house…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: And you think it’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Accumulated evil… festering for decades…
But I’m a drunk… so don’t listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So you’re saying as long as that door stays
locked, we’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I think we go down there and take a
right.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Electro-shock therapy. There’s several of
them hooked together… Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients in
multiples of ten. More enerqy-efficient or something. Let’s try a
left.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Damn-it-all! This is the Saturation
Chamber! Left again!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s a “Saturation Chamber”?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: New wrinkle on an old theory for treating
schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad
should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the
patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any
hallucination they could ever produce, it’d traumatize ’em back to
“normalcy.”</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey! Where’d you guys go?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Left, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: C’mon – I’ve got like zero interest in getting
lost down here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Price! Pritchett!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Lemme try something. Gimme a boost.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – hey, pal, that wasn’t code for –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – where you need to go?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Three steps forward – I want to get up
there.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: This whole place can’t be wired to just one
circuit –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – better than nothing. Down, big fella’.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Most fun I’ve had all day.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You need to get out more.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: So, who are you really?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What? Deep down inside?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Start with the name you were born with, and
we’ll work forward from there.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive
V.P. of –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Most of my business is making deliveries to
high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their
own shoes – let alone rewire an entire house. You don’t fit the bill –
not even close.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There’s always exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not in the movie biz. So, c’mon, gimme the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The truth is, if we keep taking rights, we’re
going to have to end up where we started.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Look, we’re all gonna be out of here in a
little while and go our separate ways, all a million bucks richer.
What’s it matter who I am or who I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Okay… So let’s say, hypothetically, I’m not
exactly who I should be – okay, so you’re right, you’re a genius, I
don’t know anybody who could’ve ever seen right through me like that –
does that end the discussion?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Alright, look: my real name is Sara, and I’m a
secretary – was, anyway – to the real Jennifer Bitch who was invited
here, and now you know and I’m begging you don’t tell anybody, ’cuz I’m
out of a job and could really use even a tenth of that money, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Can I just get a “yes” or a “no”??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: We may have to…look for other means to get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: What happened to what’s-their-names?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Eddie…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: If this is your idea of funny, think
again!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: In fact, you’re really starting to piss me
off!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Hey, pal: game called on account of boredom,
let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Eddie…??</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What is your problem?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You know, I was actually starting to like you,
you creep!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Okay, you win. You’ve successfully creeped me
out.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What are you doing –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – Eddie!!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – Eddie! Eddie! Oh my god!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – Eddie!!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s going on, you lose something down
there?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you doing? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Now it’s marked the two of you.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I suppose it’s too much to hope that all
that blood means –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – nope, he’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment?
It looks like we’re stuck here ’til morning – let’s make the best of
it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Best of a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: There is something very not normal going on
here!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: This? This is nothing. You’ve only been
dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you’re tinkering
with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out…
One of you will release it… Not meaning to, of course… then… …Bye, bye,
Miss American Pie…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Pritchett, what is this “core of
darkness”?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I thought you understood…. It’s the souls
of Vannacutt’s dead… The insanity… The horror… Victims burned alive… All
that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years…
…singing this will be the day that I die… This will be the day that
I….</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: There must be some other way out.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, until that’s found, I think it’s a good
idea we all stick together. Or wouldn’t that fit into your plans,
baby?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Fine with me. Just somebody then better go
and round up Melissa Marr.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Stalking the wild poltergeist.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Curiouser and curiouser. We’re talking a
fifty share, minimum.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Fuck me bald.</p>
<p><strong>melissa</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Could be old Melissa found what she was
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: She’s dead. Chalk up one for the
House.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Melissa!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Ms. Marr!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, Jesus: down here!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Is she alright?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: ….I don’t…know.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Something just must’ve…frightened her,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Yeah…something.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: It just…stops here.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Maybe….maybe she went up on the table.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Nobody, nothing’s been on this in…67
years.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, she went somewhere! She didn’t just up
and disappear into thin air!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No…not air –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – into the House.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There’s gotta be some way out –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Alcoholic coma, if you hurry.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Jesus H. Christ!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Oh dear.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: If you don’t calm the hell down I’m gonna
strap you in for electro-shock!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How you gonna manage that with a new
blow-hole in your dome?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Hey, if everybody’s gonna kill each other,
could you do it in another room? I’m trying to get something
accomplished here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the hell good is fixing that gonna get
us?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: An answer, I hope: exactly what – or who –
Melissa was taping.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And then where are we?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Put it this way: if it’s your face on
that tape, Mr. Moses, we’re one gunshot away from solving all our
problems –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I got it! Something, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The motor’s working, but the tape’s pretty
much D.O.A. – I could only rewind it back a couple of feet. Don’t blink,
this is probably the first and only showing.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Game, set and match, Steven. You’ve outdone
yourself. And I know it’s not good manners to ask the magician how he
did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really
happen to Ms. Marr?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Asking the wrong person again.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I mean, did she stage it all for you and
then go hide – or did you just flat out kill the little bitch –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – I pose you the same question –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – and who’s next on your list?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who’d
be first and last –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – oh, for chrissake, that’s a given; we all
know that knocking me off is the bottom line here –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – that wasn’t my original plan, but it is
starting to look more attractive –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – thank you! All the cards finally on the
goddamn table!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just know I’m not gonna make it easy for
you. We still don’t know the answer to the Million Dollar Question –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Question answered.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: They weren’t loaded when I put them in
there!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Funky little house, ain’t it? Friends, your
hostess is now going to retire for what’s left of the night. If you need
me, I’ll be in the bedroom upstairs – but try and fight that need: the
door’ll be locked, I’ll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as
breathes in the keyhole, I’m gonna empty this thing into their fucking
head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Even if I were inclined, I’ve had better –
and a lot safer – opportunities to kill off a wife.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Three times, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior
wives, so we’ve been informed.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Can’t imagine by who. I don’t suppose the
truth would interest you: that I’ve never had another wife but
Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Married. Once. Same woman. All these years.
She just slithered up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Prove it how?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: And what are you planning on doing with
that?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I just decided a million bucks is worthless if
you ain’t around to spend it. There is a way out of this place, and I’m
gonna either find it or create it. Coming or staying?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, what the hell, I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: More the merrier.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: No. I’m going back to try and find
Ms. Marr. If she’s hurt, I’ll tend to her. Dead, then I’m coming back
for him.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I think…I may have the answer.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I remember…it was a long time ago…my
father said: when the House was finally completed, make
sure…we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne-
that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Evelyn, goddamnit – !</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – Schecter, how is she pulling this off!?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Schecter, what the hell does it mean??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Someone else. Not Evelyn –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: There’s someone else in the House!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You hear somebody?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No – keep pulling, it’s moving!</p>
<p><strong>distant voice</strong>: Blackburn!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Ms. Marr…?</p>
<p><strong>distant voice</strong>: Someone else – !</p>
<p><strong>distant voice</strong>: – in the House!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I know, I know – it’s gotta be here
somewhere!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You sonovabitch, where are you, I saw
you!!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: We can do it…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s a thousand years old – we just need a
crowbar or something to get leverage – the sucker’ll pop!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No prob: I’ll just hop down the hardware
store –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – no. The basement – the room with all the
controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – not a chance – there’s too much weirdness
down there I don’t think even bullets are gonna stop.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You’re starting to sound like Pritchett.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Where is it??</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I don’t know!!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What is it??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Something with the power, I don’t know!!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: It’s down there!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s down there?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: The…Fourth of July.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: What are you babbling, you lunatic??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Electro-shock.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There’s something –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Don’t move, don’t make a sound…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: …Ms. Marr…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Is it Melissa??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: OH JESUS NO!!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – are you crazy!?!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Turn it off!! Somebody turn the damn thing
off!!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – she’s not dead! Just have to get her heart
pumping aqain!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Mouth-to-mouth!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh, Jesus….</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Adrenaline – in your bag, Blackburn, you must
have –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – even it we were in the E.R., Price:
it’s too late – her heart’s burst!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: They don’t get any deader.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I…don’t think…anybody should be touching the
body.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think I’ll do what I damn well please.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: She’s right, Price. It’s a matter for the
police.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It is in-fucking-deed. At the risk of stating
the obvious: this wasn’t exactly a goddamn suicide.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: House 2, Guests 0.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think, Pritchett, we’ve got a situation
here that even you can’t explain away as “ghosts.” This is ice- cold
homicide by person – or persons –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – not entirely unknown.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Convenient place to point blame, hon’, but
this time, the only wrong one: for all I know, somebody should be
pointing that gun at you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I was upstairs with Eddie –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – that’s the fact, bud –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – where the hell were you?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Upstairs, too. Come with me, I’ll show you
another body, a friend of mine named Schecter –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – what was he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Running all the bells and whistles we set up
to scare hell out of everybody –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – the stained glass –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – yeah, we did that –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – the window and door grates –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – no – that’s when everything went ragtime –
whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since – I
thought it was Evelyn –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – which is why you killed her.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I was upstairs!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I never saw you –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – I did: down here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And I think that’s case –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – closed.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Pritchett, you’re not joining this necktie
party?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I was upstairs looking for… well, uh…
moral support. I don’t know what’s going on down here, but I like you,
and if you say the house didn’t kill your wife –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – then I guess then it had to be you.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Thank God – I was afraid I’d be lynched
without a quorum.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: If you’ve got a gun on you, Price, I’d hand it
over now.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Not just yet. Would any of you be interested
in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Fascinated.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I was chasing after somebody I saw in the
salon.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Oh, really: who?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Didn’t catch his or her name, just followed
them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Vannacutt!!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Or somebody wanting me to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Well, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Then just wait – maybe this whoever’s got you
next on the Asylum’s equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow
inside the “Saturation Chamber.”</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, I can’t, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: If there really is someone else in this
house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I think one of you has been part and parcel
of making this situation!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The gun, Price; hand it over: now.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Don’t test me, I’m real prepared to use this
to stay alive –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – confirming everything we already know –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – I’ll take the chance, come morning and
cops, I’ll be proved right –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: – you lose either way, Price –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – listen to the man –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – listen to me, goddamnit –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – no more –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – no!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: NO!!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Who fucked with my gun??</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You sonovabitch!!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Now what do we do? We’ve got to hold him
somewhere ’til the police –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – the “Saturation Chamber.” Where he wanted to
put me.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: What would drive a madman sane would
drive a sane man mad. I need a drink. Anyone wants me, I’ll either be
upstairs or dismembered.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Pretty old and rusted out – you sure this
thing’ll hold him?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Don’t think it’ll be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Shouldn’t somebody like, stand guard or
something – just in case?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’ll stay, if it’ll ease your mind.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You sure? You’ll be alright by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’m not worried.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Can’t quite make that out – what?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: You want to see how this thing works?
Weird request, but okay…</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: You’ve got to let me know how it all
turns out. Professional courtesy and all that.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Technology by Fred Flintstone.</p>
<p><strong>see storyboards for this sequence - which shows steven
price</strong>: BEING TORMENTED BY LIGHT, SOUND, FURY AND
HALLUCINATIONS.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I think we should have taken a right back
there.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Back where?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Let’s try down here…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, check it out.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Vannacutt’s office.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Maybe there are notes or drawings of this
place, showing how those plates work.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Class of 1931.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Cheery looking bunch.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Better living through electricity.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was
made up. Look, these names… Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard… Bjorn Jensen,
Electro Therapy… Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price… They’re all here!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wait a minute… What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Everyone that was invited is related to one of
the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us…</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: And five that didn’t die.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Shit, Pritchett!!!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Price didn’t make the guest list… The
house did. It wants vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How’s a goddamn building gonna send out
invitations?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: What’s life, anyway? Waves…? Sound…?
Light…? Electricity…? I don’t know… Phone lines…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Or an on-line computer.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s crazy!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What about that other guy?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Schechter? Wrong place at the wrong time…
like you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t see Blackburn’s name on here…</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: The late Mrs. Steven Price.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Tragic, tortured Mrs. Steven Price.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Lovely Mrs. Steven Price.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Creamy, cool…and now very cooperative
Mrs. Steven Price.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: I’ve missed this.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Easy. You’ve got to keep still for a bit,
the last thing we need is a coronary.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’re the Doctor, sweetheart. ’Guess the
atropine worked, then.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Convinced all those that needed
convincing: you’re an official dead lady.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And what’s Steven’s status?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Still alive, but it’s just a matter of
time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – “oh, no, Officer, I’m very much alive –
just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game – What? What do
you mean he’s dead? It’s all my fault, I may as well have killed him
myself!”</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: “But you didn’t, Ma’am. We have all these
witnesses that saw…” well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots
him –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – the James Dean wannabe with the hair
trigger –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – or might turn out to be – very big
surprise – that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She
nearly put a bullet in Price right after your “demise.”</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: So what stopped her?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: It’s complicated. But don’t worry –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – there’s already been way too many
complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to
Melissa Marr?</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: So we don’t even know if she’s alive or dead
–</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – Price killed her, there’s no other
explanation –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – there’s plenty: for all we know, Steven’s
got her spying on us right now –</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: – bullshit –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – the whole thing is falling apart!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: It’s not, baby. Just a matter of minutes
now, before somebody pulls the trigger –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – but nobody has yet, Donald. They just
haven’t been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe
proof-positive that their lives are in danger.</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: How much more do they need than your
death at his hands?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But they didn’t see it happen, they still
have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven’s bloody hands
right next to it!</p>
<p><strong>blackburn</strong>: And how the hell are we going to do
that?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Okay: this may sound crazy, but –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is the best we’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’ll have to do.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You coming, or are you waiting for
Blackburn?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Blackburn’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: He would have been back by now.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Hey: Dr. Blackburn…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Dr. Blackburn??</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Well, at least Price is still under
wraps.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s Blackburn.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Price!!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: He’s gotta still be down here.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: You know, that crowbar, that window?
Maybe we should just call it a –</p>
<p><strong>sara/eddie</strong>: – Pritchett, shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Price!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Oh, dear.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pritchett – !</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Price, what the fuck did you do?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Please…..anyone….help me?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Melissa…?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For the love of God….please…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Melissa, it’s Sara – is that you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sara…?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Keep talking, I’ll find you!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Something….happened –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – I’m coming –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: – something horrible…I don’t understand –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: If you can stand, if you can just raise your
arm –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I woke up on the floor….there was
Dr. Blackburn…I don’t know what happened!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Then tell me, please – help me…!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Don’t think so. Stay the fuck back.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Please! I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – no!! –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the hell are you shooting –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Oh. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Poor Mr. Price –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – fuck Mr. Price! –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s okay, everything’s okay now.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: He’s dead…?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Don’t think it’s even an issue.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: We’re safe?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Uhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Okay – I’ll admit it: I’m totally,
clinically insane. But I’m still the only one who actually got a check
tonight. It’s yours – if you just get me the hell out of here now.</p>
<p><strong>eddie/sara</strong>: You got yourself a deal.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Steven, you poor, absolutely clueless geek.
All it would’ve taken was a simple divorce – and ripping our pre-nup to
little pieces.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But no matter how it ended, please know just
one thing: from that first moment I set eyes on you, I’ve always loved…
your money. You, personally – well, frankly just the sight of you has
always turned my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Is that a fact, Princess?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, you could have saved us all a great
deal of time, not to mention money, if you’d just let me in on it years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: This kind of special effects crap doesn’t
come cheap – and I had to pay out of pocket! No write-offs here!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: How –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – you must be kidding. You’re talking to
Steven Price – every place you’ve gone, every person you’ve seen, every
word you and Blackburn ever said to each other: bugged, taped, seen and
heard as it happened!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Steven –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – anything, sweetheart, you need only speak
–</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – what…are…you…going…to –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – just what you wanted everyone here to
believe in the first place: I’m going to murder you, Evelyn, with the
greatest of pleasure –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: – wit…nesses –</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: – witnesses to what? You’re already dead,
Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Steven…? Are you doing that?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right – The house
<u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Evelyn… Get up… NOW!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Steven??</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s the Patients – the Evil – we’ve released
it –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: NO – !!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He was right! Pritchett was right!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s…the House!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – was that??</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Something…that should probably be…avoided
–</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The opening’s still too small, we’ll never get
through!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: For chrissake give me a hand!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Pritchett: what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: He must’ve unsealed the room!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: How, he’s supposed to be dead!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I think…it’s time…to go.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Hail Mary, full of grace – the house is
growing!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s not going to let us out!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No. It’s just trying to frighten us.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s succeeding!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: All the plates sealing the windows and doors –
there’s got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn’t just
appear out of thin air – there’s got to be pulleys, cables or something,
that make them go up and down.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: In the attic?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: If you know where it is, get there!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Me? You’ve gotta be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where did it go?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Run.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I said run!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: EDDIE!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sara…? Sara…?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Sara!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Grab my hand.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Eddie!!!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: If there is a God…</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: No-no-no!!!! Why me, why me, you
sonovabitch!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Whyyyyyyy??????</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Is it too late to take back a couple of
things I said?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances,
I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Better put it on hold ’til we find
Pritchett.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I don’t do groups.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pritchett??</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Oh, c’mon – don’t grow a conscience now,
f’chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Alright, alright! I won’t leave ’em here
to die!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I found the way out!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Anybody still alive? I’m giving you ten
seconds! Two-four-six-eight –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – hey! –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – ten.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pritchett, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Up here –</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: – I think you better hurry – there’s
something of a time issue here.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Move!!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pritchett!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Over here!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: Please. It’s been a bad enough day –</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Get out ot the way!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Eddie!!</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: I’m just the contractor’s son! I had
nothing to do with your current condition!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I think if you’re coming, Mr. Pritchett, it’s
now or never.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: The Police and Coroner arrived at
the House on Haunted Hill at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: Watson Pritchett told the Police
that they need a Sherman tank to get into the house. But when the first
officer on the scene tried the front door knob, it opened without so
much as a squeak.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: And for all the horror that
Pritchett described, the House was found to be utterly unexceptional and
undisturbed – even the dust still in place.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: And not one sign of the party’s
hosts, Steven and Evelyn Price. The only person not surprised by this
was Watson Pritchett.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: They’re part ot the House now. That’s the
way it works.</p>
<p><strong>christopher lee</strong>: The truth will likely be never
known. Unless on some strange whim, you decide to spend the evening
inside the House on Haunted Hill. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>pritchett</strong>: It won’t stop until it’s got every one
