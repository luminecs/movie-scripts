<h1 id="transatlantic-merry-go-round">transatlantic-merry-go-round</h1>
<p><strong>2 long shot–night</strong>: Large ocean liner, plowing
through darkened waters, its decks and portholes brilliantly
illuminated.</p>
<p><strong>3 quick flash–medium shot–prow of ship</strong>: Coming
straight onto the CAMERA. The speed at which she is traveling throws a
phosphorescent spray many feet into the air–almost up to the bowsprit,
under which is carved, in ornate letters, <U>S. S. Progress</U>.</p>
<p><strong>4 long shot</strong>: Taking in audience and entertainers on
board the <U>S. S. Progress</U>. The voices of Jean Sargent and Frank
Parker are heard singing <U>Rock and Roll</U>.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Hello again! This is Chad
Denby–remember?–h’mm –Your Master of Ceremonies–coming to you with
another program in mid-atlantic–for the benefit of you folks who just
tuned in I want to say that the passengers are all comfortably seated–I
wish you listeners back there in the small towns and villages could see
the life and glamour on this floating palace–We’re having <U>oceans</U>
of fun–Am I hot tonight!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh-h, Mister Den-n-by–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yep–everybody’s having a good time but
me–What do you want, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic
Ocean–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: But, Mary–everybody’s having such a great
time– why spoil it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Somebody’s got to do it–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Well, let’s hear the poem–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean–how you spread
across the sea–From New York to dear old Europe–just for boats to ride
on thee–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Very good, Mary–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But I’m not finished yet—-And your waves are
so colossal–rocking boats both to and fro–Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you
—-how I love you–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: What’s the matter, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m getting seasick–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: H’mm–<U>Dear</U> Atlantic–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Denby–What do you think I ought to do with
that part?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail
it through a porthole–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: You are listening to the golden voices of
Jean Sargent and Frank Parker, who are entertaining with that rollicking
bit of syncopation, <U>Rock and Roll</U>–every- body’s having a good
time–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Everyone but me–what do you want now,
Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I feel better now–I’ve got a riddle! When is a
plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean
soup not a plate of noodle soup?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: When it falls off the table and turns
turtle–Cute?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Mary–fall off the boat and turn to the
left–</p>
<p><strong>7 long shot</strong>: Finale of act of trio in which Sally is
prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8 close shot</strong>: Trio taking bows.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Listen to that applause–what other steamship
line gives you this entertainment on the high seas? Where is it coming
from?–you said it! the Transatlantic Merry- go-round of 1934–What a
boat!–A snappy deck– three hot funnels–a hundred galloping portholes–
and all nice people! Try a trip on our boat for what ails you. Well,
this concludes the performance of the At- lantic Follies–Chad Denby
signing off until tomorrow night–Good night, folks! DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p><strong>10 auditorium</strong>: Passengers laughing and talking and
strolling out on the moonlit decks. PICK UP LOTHER AND FOLLOW HIM DOWN
COMPANIONWAY. PICK UP CAPTAIN AND THIRD OFFICER coming up from the
opposite direction.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Good night, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Good night, Mr. Lother.</p>
<p><strong>11 lother walks down companionway to sally’s</strong>:
ROOM–NUMBER 51C.</p>
<p><strong>12 medium close shot–lother</strong>: He is lying on the
floor–dead.</p>
<p><strong>13 close shot–exterior door</strong>: The Steward comes up
and starts pounding on the door.</p>
<p><strong>14 inside charthouse</strong>: First and Second Navigation
Officers leaning over chart.</p>
<p><strong>first navigation officer</strong>: Have you taken the
soundings?</p>
<p><strong>second navigation officer</strong>: Yes, Sir–here’s our
position now.</p>
<p><strong>second navigation officer</strong>: We’re off the
southeastern point of Newfoundland– 43� West and 52� North–running dead
to time. Twenty-four hours ago–38�, 41�– Thirty-six hours off the point
light–fifty-eight hours –back in–New York!</p>
<p><strong>newsboy</strong>: Paper!–Extra!–Ballinger breaks jail!</p>
<p><strong>18 reverse angle</strong>: He jumps out, pays taxi; porter
grabs his hand baggage.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Name and reservation, sir?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Lee Lother–4C.</p>
<p><strong>19 travel shot</strong>: As they move through the crowd.
SOUND TRACK carries paper boy’s voice calling the extra. Lother stops
and buys a paper. In close proximity is a man reading one of the
papers–a woman is looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Escaped again!–More bank robberies!–More hold-
ups!–What we need is a police force!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: They’ll be a lot of shooting before they get
that guy again–slippery as an eel.</p>
<p><strong>20 exterior docks</strong>: A limousine discharges its
passengers. A taxi behind it is tooting impatiently to get
alongside.</p>
<p><strong>21 interior taxi–anya rosson and her husband</strong>: Anya
is a young Russian, blonde, extremely attractive, beautifully
dressed–speaks with a slight accent. She is puffing nervously at a
cigarette. Her husband is young, middle-aged Grand Mitchell type. They
get quickly out of the car and move toward dock. At first-class
gangplank they stop. Porter carrying their baggage starts to take it
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Wait a minute, porter–my husband’s not going
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Going to miss me?</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: Send me a wireless when you arrive–and have
a good time–that’s the important thing.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It’s all happened so suddenly–I can hardly
believe I’m going–</p>
<p><strong>22 what she sees—quick flash–lother–</strong>: Near the rail.
He is looking in another direction– obviously does not see her.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Too bad you couldn’t come, too, Herbert.</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: As long as we can indulge your
whims–somebody in the family has to work. Good-bye, my dear. If I keep
those Duluth people waiting another minute, I’ll lose the deal.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Don’t let me go without the jewel case. The
American Express cheques are in there, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: You can pick up your letter of credit at
Cook’s in Cherbourg. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>24 dolly shot–he hurries back through the crowd</strong>:
Finds a porter–hands him a check.</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: Get my baggage out of the check room and put
it aboard this ship.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Yes, sir–where’s your reservation?</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: Cabin 108–Second Class–I’ll see you
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Take these things to 51C and the other trunk
has my name on it just like this.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: You get aboard, Miss–I’ll take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It’s very important–it has our costumes in
it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: The big star of Chad Denby’s big seagoing
show. We’ll have your name up in lighthouses from here to England.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, that’s something–even if only the fish
can see it.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Are you happy?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Will be–as soon as the ship sails.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I thought I had our sailing covered up– –and
here it is.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Do you think Lother could have seen it?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: You’d better get on board. I’ll take care of
the trunks. Hey, porter!</p>
<p><strong>first vaudevillian</strong>: Just read in <U>Variety</U> you
were sailing. Picked up some of the boys and girls to come down and give
you a cheer.</p>
<p><strong>first vaudevillian</strong>: Say, these steamship companies
are going into the show business in a big way.</p>
<p><strong>second vaudevillian</strong>: I should say so–this
transatlantic showboat idea is a novelty.</p>
<p><strong>third vaudevillian</strong>: I think it’s a conspiracy–They
want to take all the vaudeville acts out to the middle of the Atlantic
and dump them overboard.</p>
<p><strong>fourth vaudevillian</strong>: Ha! Ha! That’s a dirty trick to
play on the fish!</p>
<p><strong>fifth vaudevillian</strong>: Do they pay any kind of money on
these big ships?</p>
<p><strong>first vaudevillian</strong>: Sixty-two fifty for teams and a
hundred and a quarter for quartets.</p>
<p><strong>fifth vaudevillian</strong>: I wouldn’t sing on a rowboat for
that kind of dough!</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: JAMES BRETT New York Age: 28 Single
Occupation: Architect</p>
<p><strong>camera pans up to medium close shot of jimmy</strong>: BRETT
. He takes back his passport.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Now listen, Jimmy–!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Not here–follow me around the shed.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t you know better than to talk to me with
people around?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Oh, putting on the swell, eh?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I thought you were a smart guy.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: If I was smart I wouldn’t be working my way
over on this ship.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: We didn’t have enough dough for two tickets,
did we?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: We coulda got two third-class!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get
you signed on–they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler–made him talk. The
heat’s on, Shortie–and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Oh, I’m not squawkin’, but I’m not used to
working and it’s a bad habit to get into.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: It’ll never hurt you—Got any money?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: A dollar seventy and I’m gonna keep it!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No, you’re not. Give me that dollar
seventy.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: I’ll give you half of it. Here’s seventy
cents.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Nix, the law!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yes, sir!–I will, sir–Certainly, sir!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: He’s a colored man in chauffeur’s uniform
carrying a basket of fruit.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: I’ll watch for him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thank you, and here’s seventy cents for your
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: You speaking to me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Can’t you read?</p>
<p><strong>29 shortie and two cops</strong>: Shortie heaves a sigh of
relief and drops his cig- arette. The cop puts his foot on it.</p>
<p><strong>first cop</strong>: You ought to know better than that.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Quick, let me have that money. I’m broke and
I’ll need it for tips.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Oh, no–You’re not gonna give my hard-earned
money away.</p>
<p><strong>32 brett and shortie</strong>: Brett takes advantage of the
situation knowing the steward is Shortie’s boss.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Nix–here comes my boss.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t forget that $l.70 change.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: You’re a wise guy–Gimme back–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Shortie, look!</p>
<p><strong>33 what they see</strong>: Two plain-clothes detectives are
shaking hands with INSPECTOR MCKINNEY. Behind McKinney is a porter
carrying his suitcase, etc.</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: Well, pleasant trip, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Thanks. I’ve been waiting fifteen years
for this vacation. What are you boys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>34 close shot–newspaper in detective’s hand</strong>: As he
lets it fall open. Headlines:</p>
<p><strong>35 medium close shot–brett and shortie</strong>: WATCHING THE
INSPECTOR.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: McKinney!–The smartest dick in Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: You don’t think–?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Looks like he’s taking a trip–see the
baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through
the room while they were grilling–let’s see how good his memory is.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Jimmy, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>first detective</strong>: We got a tip Ballinger might jump
this boat.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Not interested, boys. When I left
headquarters this morning–I cut the words “police” and “criminals” right
out of my vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>second detective</strong>: Don’t blame you, sir–you’ve earned
a rest.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Pardon me, gentlemen–have you noticed a
colored man in chauffeur’s uniform, carrying a l-a-r-g-e basket of–
fruit?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>37 brett and inspector</strong>: CAMERA PANS TO coffin on a
truck being pushed by a docker. A woman in mourning follows and gets on
the boat. All through this scene policemen are seen at short intervals
making their way hurriedly through the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>38 travel shot</strong>: Until the coffin becomes the
background of a bride and groom who are being showered with rice.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re darlings to see me off–I’ll write you
as soon as I get there.</p>
<p><strong>vaudevillian</strong>: Coming back on the same boat?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Guess not–we’re going to try and line up some
kind of bookings over there.</p>
<p><strong>vaudevillian</strong>: Well, good-by, beautiful–I’ve wanted
an excuse to do this for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>another vaudevillian</strong>: Line up, boys!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: That was sweet of you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Want to take it back?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I thought you were one of my friends.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’d <U>like</U> to be. Sailing on the
<U>Progress?</U></p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yes–are you?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I wouldn’t miss this boat for a million.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant
you she’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll say she is!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Nice lines–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Like her paint job?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Very much–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’ve got lipstick all over you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I could stand some more–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: –You’ll have all the boys tipping their hats
to you– –let me wipe it off.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No! Don’t touch it! I want the <U>world</U>
to see my <U>shame</U>.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Come on, Sally.</p>
<p><strong>42 close shot–sally</strong>: Looking back over her shoulder
at Brett</p>
<p><strong>43 quick flash–lother’s face–</strong>: Among the crowded
passengers at the railing, watching Sally. He smiles to himself and
steps back.</p>
<p><strong>44 quick flash–anya</strong>: Watching Lother.</p>
<p><strong>45 close shot–brett</strong>: His eyes are twinkling–there is
a smile on his lips –he is evidently very much impressed. He watches
Sally move toward gangplank.</p>
<p><strong>46 medium shot</strong>: As Brett starts to move away he
bumps into a messenger boy carrying a beautiful bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Who are those flowers for?</p>
<p><strong>messenger boy</strong>: Mrs. Armitich.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Glad I caught you in time–Mrs. Armitich is
not sailing –so give them to my sister–that lady with the beautiful red
hair going up the gangplank.</p>
<p><strong>messenger boy</strong>: But I’m supposed to–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: –don’t argue or I’ll close my account!</p>
<p><strong>messenger boy</strong>: Okay. What’s her name?–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: –With the red hair–Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>47 gangplank–long shot from brett’s angle</strong>: We see
the boy overtake Sally just before she steps aboard. She takes the
flowers–looks surprised– evidently asks the boy who they came from. We
see the boy point in Brett’s direction. She smiles her thanks just as
the fellow singing through the megaphone comes to the phrase–“It was
sweet of you.”</p>
<p><strong>48 taxi arriving-apparently empty</strong>: Porter yanks open
the door. Seated on a suitcase on the floor, the befuddled victim of
alcohol, is DAN CAMPBELL . He has a bottle in his hand and beams at the
porter.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Come in, my dear fellow–pull up a
chair–delighted to meet you! My name’s Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Come on–get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Gentlemen–a toast! Here’s to–</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: He’s got a ticket for England–some guy
loaded him into my cab.</p>
<p><strong>49 travel shot–dan</strong>: As he staggers through the
crowd–pauses to search through his pockets for something, as he comes to
Mary Livingston and Chad Denby, CAMERA PANS TO favor them. Chad is
talking to Mary.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Mary–I’ve got a great show for this trip–and
with my dry wit and humor–h’mm–a few more trips and we’ll have to
furnish straphangers for the passengers to hang on!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: With your dry wit and humor–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Oh yeah?–My personality put this thing
over–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maurice Chevalier! There’s a fellow with
personality.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: What’s he got that I haven’t got?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, he has a straw hat–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: So have I–I can get it right out of my
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: –And he has sex appeal.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Get that out of your trunk.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: All right–don’t spoil the trip with any of
those jokes– there’s a nice bunch of people on this trip–nothing but
class–I looked over the passenger list and they’re all members of the
Who’s Who!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Never mind the Who’s Who–Before I get on this
boat I want to know What’s What! How about my raise? All I get out of
these ocean trips is dizzy.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Don’t blame it on the ocean!–All right,
you’ll get the raise!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is that one of the Who’s Who?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No–He’s probably one of the “Here’s How.”
Take it easy–the ocean’s pretty rough today–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ll say–how fast is this boat going?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Oh,–we’re doing about thirty–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Pretty good–thirty <U>miles</U> an hour–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No. <U>Knots</U>!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Knots!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I can see you’re no gentleman–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s funny–maybe you can use him in the show,
Mr. Denby.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: That’s me!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yes–Me–in person!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where’s your <U>dry</U> humor now, Chad?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Be careful–come on–I better pour you on the
boat–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I can see where I won’t talk much to you.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: <U>Nuts</U> to you too!</p>
<p><strong>50 long shot–the docks</strong>: The steerage and
second-class gangways are already being lowered–visitors are streaming
down the gangplanks from the first saloon. The orchestra is
playing–quartermasters are shouting instructions–paper streamers are
commencing to be thrown aboard.</p>
<p><strong>51 quick flash–the last of the freight being</strong>: SWUNG
ABOARD IN THE NETS.</p>
<p><strong>52 gangplank–medium shot</strong>: Denby has Campbell by the
arm helping him up the gangplank. Campbell stumbles and his rubber legs
buckle under him. Denby has some difficulty helping Campbell back on his
feet. After Campbell is put on his feet again, he turns to Denby, and
<U>very</U> seriously remarks:</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Steady, old boy–I’ve got you.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Thanks–I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>first policeman</strong>: He’s not there, Inspector–we’ve
searched every inch of the boat.</p>
<p><strong>inspector</strong>: Okay–Report back to the desk.</p>
<p><strong>53 long shot–ship and docks</strong>: The last gangplank is
dragged ashore. The orchestra strikes up <U>Rock and Roll</U>. People
are cheering –streamers are flying in great profusion.</p>
<p><strong>54 long shot–from docks</strong>: Slowly the big ship
majestically maneuvers from the mooring. The streamers become taut–snap
as the <U>S. S. Progress</U>–music playing–passengers waving–whistles
blowing–move out into the stream.</p>
<p><strong>55 medium close shot–lifeboat upper deck</strong>: Slowly the
CAMERA is raised and we see the face of Ballinger, which we recognize
from the newspaper. It immediately disappears and his hand comes up and
drops a policeman’s uniform and cap over the side of the boat into the
water.</p>
<p><strong>56 fade-in</strong>: :ONE OR TWO ATMOSPHERIC SHOTS ABOARD
SHIP</p>
<p><strong>57 brett’s cabin aboard the <u>s. s. progress</u></strong>:
Brett has changed into flannels and is fixing his tie. The door opens
and Shortie, carrying a heavy package and a bundle of telegrams, enters.
Brett sees him in the mirror, speaks without turning.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Took your time getting here.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yer lucky I’m here at all. I tell you,
Jimmy–my feet’ll never hold out.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a
ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yeah–but high livin’s made me soft.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: How’re the tips?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: A dollar forty.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll need it–gave my last buck to the bedroom
steward.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Come on– I’ll promote a card game, and we’ll
be sitting pretty.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Until then–the dollar forty stays with
me.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Don’t let money spoil a beautiful
friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain’t a
job– it’s a marathon.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, Shortie!– –there’s a girl on this
ship–</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: –there’s thousands of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: A thousand? She’s one in a million–right off
the top of the rosebush!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: This is a business trip!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: She was wearing a white dress with a cute,
black hat– and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny–her name’s not on
the passenger list.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Maybe she’s in the show–One of the
troupers–did you ever think of that?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Why <U>didn’t</U> I think of that?–I am going
to scout around and see if I can find her.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Everything in order, sir? What are
<U>you</U> doing here, my lad?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Telegrams.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Well–get a move on yer–then get back to yer
station.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Just a minute, steward–haven’t you forgotten
something?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: No, sir?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: My change.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Change?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: A dollar forty–out of the two dollars I gave
you.</p>
<p><strong>58 close shot–it’s contents</strong>: Gambling paraphernalia,
cards, dice, etc.</p>
<p><strong>59 close shot–shortie’s hand</strong>: Takes key and opens
his drawer in Brett’s trunk. He takes out a pair of dice and rolls them
quickly two or three times on top of the trunk. Each time they throw a
seven.</p>
<p><strong>shortie’s voice</strong>: Not bad–I’ll use these to get
even.</p>
<p><strong>60 medium shot</strong>: As he moves toward door.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Shortie!–you know my motto?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Pleasure first if it don’t interfere with
business.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Right!–but it doesn’t have to apply to
you–Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and
give me the office.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Now you’re talkin’!</p>
<p><strong>61 outside–trucking shot</strong>: Shortie coming down
corridor with a big basket of flowers and the parcel.</p>
<p><strong>62 medium close shot–lady passenger</strong>: She sticks her
head out of her stateroom door and sees Shortie.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Boy!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Will you come in and fix my porthole?</p>
<p><strong>63 outside</strong>: Shortie is just closing the door. Sally
Marsh enters scene.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m looking for 48.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Right down there, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>64 door 48</strong>: Chad Denby’s office on board.</p>
<p><strong>65 medium close shot</strong>: Ned and Denby. Ned is sitting
there very worried about Sally because Lother is aboard ship.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Then, after the first number, I tell the one
about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window–the Scotchman says
to the window–“Gee you’re tight.”– and the window says–“You loosen up a
bit and so will I.”–Good?–And then I do the one– Oh–you don’t like it,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Chad–Lother’s on the boat, and I’m worried sick
about Sally–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Oh!–So that’s it. Does she know he’s on
board?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: No–but I’m going to keep my eye on–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Am I a member of this club?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: You’re the President. Come in! Your brother
was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Are you paying any attention to his
jokes?–the first thing you know, you’ll be taking piano lessons from
Venus de Milo– Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Everything O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd
Street.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Like it?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Swell–You’ve got Times Square right here–all
but the noises–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yep–spending lots of time aboard–you see,
Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: And you’ve put it over–haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Why not? I give ’em a great show–and you
know– We’re doing capacity, Sally–and all <U>Nice</U> people–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No–not much–excepting–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Still got my picture, I see–I was pretty dumb
then, wasn’t I, Chad?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No–Inexperienced– A red-headed kid–homemade
clothes–Broadway was Paradise–and a slot at the Automat was a
Banquet.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I came to tell you what a swell guy I think
you are to do this–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Do what–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You made it possible for us to get away at a
few hours’ notice–you never asked why, but I guess you know.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: News travels fast on Broadway–you had to get
away from a rat–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: It wasn’t only that–Ned was in a jam.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I get it–Lee Lother have a hand in that,
too?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I was so crazy about him–anything he did or
said was O.K. by me. I introduced him to people–even after I knew his
stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn’t
seem to matter–I didn’t care– –until he roped Ned in. Some confidence
game–and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you
were running around with a racketeer–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Women have a curious taste for knickknacks.
When I found out about Ned–tried to make a break–Lee wouldn’t stand for
it and–well–here I am!</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Stay on the other side of the pond for a
couple of months–you’ll soon forget all about it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Chad Denby broadcasting– –the nicest man I
ever knew–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: But not nice enough to marry–eh?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Come on, now–you’ve forgotten all about
that.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I’ll never love anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Women are such fools!–Why do so many of us
pass up <U>right</U> guys?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Guess they’re dull–nothing for you to
reform.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Can you give me names of the people in the
show?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Well, sir–there’s–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: –don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>68 reverse angle–close shot–brett</strong>: Looking up at the
wall above the clerk’s head. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>69 what he sees</strong>: An announcement of the entertainers
in a frame. It includes a photograph of Sally with her name under
it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sally Marsh is the lady I’m looking
for–where’s her cabin?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: 51C–around to the left–second tier.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: What stateroom has Miss Marsh?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Miss Sally Marsh?–51C.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Where would that be?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Around to the left, sir–second tier.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>72 corridor–staterooms on either side</strong>: Lother is on
his way to find Sally–Brett a few yards ahead of him with the same
purpose in mind. As Lother passes a cabin the door opens quickly and
Anya steps in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>73 close-up of ned</strong>: Watching.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>75 reverse shot–lother</strong>: Unable to believe his eyes,
it is a moment before he speaks. During this, Brett continues down the
corridor.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Anya!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Don’t you hate people that surprise you? … I
do. We can’t stand here.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Well … guess we’d better have a drink on
it.</p>
<p><strong>77 brett knocking briskly on the door of 51c.</strong>: No
answer. He knocks again. A stewardess comes out of Sally’s room.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: The lady is not in her cabin, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>78 medium close shot–lee lother and anya rosson.</strong>:
Sitting in wicker chairs, in a quiet part of the palm court. Anya’s mood
is very gay. She smiles at Lee. His is very thoughtful–and none too
pleasant. The music is playing and passengers are dancing.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You’re still surprised, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Anya, I think you’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Any woman’s crazy to feel about a man the way
I do about you.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I wasn’t running out on you. When I got over
there– made my plans–I’d have sent for you.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Then why the sudden exit without even telling
me?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Do you want the truth, Anya?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: It would be a nice change from you.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I had an idea your husband was getting
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You’re a charming liar. You <U>know</U>,
Herbert’s too dull to be suspicious about anything–even when I suddenly
decided to come to Europe at a few hours’ notice–</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: How’d you ever get away with it?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: When I found out you were going I just had an
attack of nerves–a few tears–and Herbert was on his way downtown to get
my passport … so who cares … I’m here with you … and that’s all that
matters to me.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I never want to go back….</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Here’s to Europe! Couldn’t try to look a
little less glum, could you?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Don’t be crazy–I’m tickled to death to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: That’s fine–because you’re going to see a lot
of me … for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>79 dolly back from anya and lother to a medium</strong>: SHOT
OF PALM COURT FROM DECK ANGLE Brett is coming along the deck. As he
enters Palm Court he bumps into a man who is just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>80 medium close shot</strong>: The man is Inspector
McKinney.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Hello, young fellow. Did you find that
basket of flowers?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Fruit!</p>
<p><strong>81 medium shot–anya and lother</strong>: Summers is coming
toward them with outstretched hands, his face beaming.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: How are you, Mr. Lother? Not intruding, I
hope?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: This is Jack Summers–Mrs. Rosson.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: A rare pleasure to meet you, ma’am! Where I
come from –out in Montana–we have some pretty women, but I guess if you
walked down Main Street they’d turn out the fire brigade.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Montana?</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Lumber, ma’am–spent all my life out there
piling up a bank balance– –and now gosh darn it–“Honest Jack”–that’s
what they call me–is goin’ to see the world.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: You’re wasting your time–she’s a friend of
mine.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Eh?… Oh.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: He works the boats as a “come-on” man. We
ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack’s a
pretty good dealer himself.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: There’s a lot of trout in this stream just
waitin’ for a fly. I’ve already been workin’ on a young fellow from
Chicago–related to one of the big packin’ families–on his way to
Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Keep your voice down–that blonde boy is
looking straight over here.</p>
<p><strong>82 close shot–brett</strong>: At table.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: That’s him! That’s the sucker!!</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Looks lonesome–Bring him over here.</p>
<p><strong>85 interior second-class buffet–medium close</strong>:
Mr. Rosson and fellow passenger standing at bar in second-class
buffet.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Something about an ocean voyage that
makes everybody happy!</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>passenger</strong>: Oh! Going over on business, eh?</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: –Er–Yes–you might call it that–</p>
<p><strong>91 medium close shot–anya and brett, lother</strong>: AND
SUMMERS BRETT has Anya’s hand, and is looking at her bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: We’ll have cocktails and then a few rubbers of
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I can think of nothing nicer. It’s very kind
of you to invite me–</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m just commencing to enjoy this trip.</p>
<p><strong>92 opposite end of palm court</strong>: SALLY IS JUST COMING
OUT OF LIBRARY. She carries a couple of books under her arm. She pauses
a moment to watch the dancers through the archway.</p>
<p><strong>92-a medium shot</strong>: Suddenly Brett stares–he has seen
Sally and for a moment struggles between courtesy and desire.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Hmm! So am I. If you’ll excuse me I have some
important unfinished business. I’ll see you all later.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: We’ll be expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>93 archway</strong>: Sally has not seen Brett–she moves out
onto deck. A steward appears carrying a small tray of crackers.</p>
<p><strong>94 companionway leading to sports deck</strong>: Sally is
just about to ascend as Brett comes quickly into scene.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Where have you been hiding?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Oh–hello! I got the flowers. That was sweet
of you–thank you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t thank me. Do you recognize me without
the lipstick?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: So you washed it off!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: How about giving me another coat?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Wait a minute!–They’re dancing in the palm
court–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Good-by!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: There’s soft music–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: –sorry–got an appointment to play
shuffle-board.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Have we?–Well, I’d just as soon play
shuffle-board.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hello, Denby!</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I thought I put you to bed.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I’ve
been looking all over for you.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Well, did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed
for?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: This is a fine time to be asking that. You’re
on your way to France.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s news to me. I’d better cable my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Hey, boy–give this man a cablegram blank.
Where is your wife?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: She’s in New York.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Here you are, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What’ll I say?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Tell her you’re on your way to France and
will be back in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>96 insert</strong>: Cablegram which reads: “Will be back in
New York in four weeks.”</p>
<p><strong>dan’s voice</strong>: How much will that be?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Eighty cents a word–three–six–nine words.
That’ll be seven twenty, but it’s too much–I’ll show you how to save
some money.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: In New York.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Your wife knows that, don’t she?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Then you don’t have to tell her–cut out New
York.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: “Will be back in four weeks”– –that saves
you eighty cents right there!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s right–here’s the eighty cents for you.
I’d rather see you get it than the company–send it right off.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Wait a minute–I think I can cut out a
couple o’ more words.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: “Will–be–back–in–four–weeks.” You don’t
need the “will be.” Just say “Back in four weeks.”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s right. I owe you a dollar sixty.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Wait a minute–I think I can cut something
else out. “Back in four weeks.” Instead of “in four weeks”–say “next
month”–That saves another word.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Right. Here’s eighty cents. Send it.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Just a minute–I don’t think we need the
word “Back” –Where <U>is</U> “Back”?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Back is in New York.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Your wife knows that, don’t she?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Cut it out.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Now we get it down to two words–“next
month.”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Send that.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Wait a minute–What <U>is</U> next
month?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Next month is June.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Fine! Instead of saying “next month”–we’ll
use one word and say “June.”</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: June? That’s my wife’s name.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: That’s great! There’s the address and
message all in one word.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: O.K.! Send that!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Just a minute–Your wife knows her own name,
doesn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Well, there’s no use in sending it. See
that–I saved you seven twenty!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well. I’d rather see <U>you</U> get it than the
company.</p>
<p><strong>98 long shot–sports deck</strong>: Four attractive girls are
squealing excitedly as they play deck tennis in shorts.</p>
<p><strong>99 medium shot–brett and sally</strong>: As they move along
the deck.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: This is great. I’ll be able to watch your act
every night.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re not very ambitious, are you?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>–up
here in the moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You work too fast for me, young man.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Aw–give a feller a break. My cards are on the
table– I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Never eat before the show.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well–breakfast? Lunch?</p>
<p><strong>sally’s voice</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I was just about to start a game with this
gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: McKinney’s the name.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Miss Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: This is Mr.–er–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Brett is the name.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: I think I’ve met you before,
Mr. Brett.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, yes. On the pier.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Before that. Your face is very
familiar.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist
on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: No–not quite.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Their faces are familiar–but not to each
other.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Now that that’s settled, why not make the
game a foursome?</p>
<p><strong>ad-lib</strong>: Fine! … O.K.!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Miss Marsh and I will play against you
two.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No–I’ll take Sally and give you the best of
it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Tell you what I’ll do. I’ll toss you for
her–heads she plays with me.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: O.K. Heads you win.</p>
<p><strong>101 insert of coin in denby’s palm</strong>: It has two heads
on it.</p>
<p><strong>102 brett</strong>: He is rubbing his head.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’m O.K. It didn’t hurt much.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I think you’re very unkind.</p>
<p><strong>young fellow</strong>: I’m awfully sorry.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: That’s perfectly all right. Don’t mention
it.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re just a Master of Ceremonies. He might
have knocked his head off.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: What’s the difference? He’s got more heads
than he needs.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I don’t get the humor of that remark.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: <U>He</U> does. Here’s your quarter,
Brett.</p>
<p><strong>103 brett and sally</strong>: While walking.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Is there a bump on my head?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t feel any–yes, I do!–Oh–that’s a
shame.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t stop, nurse–I think I’m going to
faint.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You <U>are</U> a lunatic!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Even Cupid’s becoming modern, using medicine
balls instead of darts.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You know, you’re not a <U>bad</U>-looking
girl. In fact–I think you’re lovely.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Married?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Nothing to speak of. What is this–third
degree?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I want you to get used to my voice–you’re
going to hear it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What a horrible death! Do you know what you
remind me of?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: A little boy that has escaped from his nurse
and–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: –you want to adopt him!–Good for you!</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Here we are, folks–eighty thousand wild-eyed
fans go mad–they go mad as Chad Denby–with the arms of iron, and the
nerves of steel–picks up his racket– What is this thing–a racket or a
mallet?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Looks to me like standard equipment for
the Department of Street Cleaning–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Too bad we’re not making a trip around the
world– maybe we could finish this game. Hey! When you get through with
that conference, shoot that last disk!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Watch this one.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney’s voice</strong>: Nice shot!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: You can always tell how much a man’s
traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yeah–if he’d only stick to shuffle-board.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Feeling a little better, I see.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes, yes–the air– –I’m getting plenty of air.
Miss Marsh–Mrs. Rosson.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: How do you do. Would you care to finish the
game? I have a slight earache. –and it’s so noisy up here.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.
Don’t forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thanks. I’ll be there. About
seven-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Sooner–if you like. See you again, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Isn’t she attractive?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Very–your mother?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t be a c-a-t.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You asked me to dine with you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t rub it in.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: But I’ll have cocktails with you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: At seven-thirty?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sooner it you like.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Fatal fascination of James Brett wins
out.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Wrong again– But I dislike possessive
women.</p>
<p><strong>106 smoking room</strong>: The competitors, Denby, Brett,
Sally, and McKinney are seated at the table in the order named. The
steward has just placed the cool drinks in front of them. He hands the
check to Brett. McKinney grabs it.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: No! no! You trimmed us. The drinks are on
me. That’s funny, I must have left my wallet in the cabin.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: That’s all right. I’ll attend to this.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Wait a minute–let’s match for it.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Never mind–I’ll pay for it now. It’ll save
time.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well–thanks for the game and the drinks, and
now if you’ll excuse me–</p>
<p><strong>107 travel shot</strong>: As Brett follows Sally.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ll be there–Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Those kids seem to be getting along
fine!–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: It must be the sea air–it gets everybody.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: He’s a likable chap–he’s got an honest
face–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: It’s all right–if you like honest faces–let’s
have another drink–Steward!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Oh no–I don’t want to impose on you– It’s
funny about that billfold–I could have sworn I had it-</p>
<p><strong>109 an open billfold and a hand extracting a</strong>:
FIFTY-DOLLAR BILL PULL CAMERA BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT. Brett is in his cabin
in Tuxedo trousers and dress shirt. He hands the bill to Shortie who
looks slightly surprised.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Where’d you get the dough?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Inspector McKinney.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Are you screwy?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I fell in his arms–Couldn’t resist it.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: You know where that sense of humor’s goin’
to get you one of these days–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Here–drop it where they’ll find it and return
it to him. He’s not a bad egg. I’ll ship him back the fifty before we
arrive.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: You take some awful chances.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well, I had to get some dough to play with
those suckers. Here, get this changed.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Get a lot of one’s and a couple of five’s.
It’ll be a good flash.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Will you cash a fifty-dollar American
Express check for me?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: And will you please give me thirty one’s
and two ten’s for this?</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: There you are, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: Thirty one’s and two ten’s?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>111 medium close–lother and summers</strong>: In Anya’s
cabin.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Can you read ’em Jack?</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: They’re a cinch to read–Queen of Clubs–
–Ace of Diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: The man that marks them is an artist–two
hundred and fifty bucks for six decks–and they’re worth it.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: The country boy’s about due.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Better unlock the door. Sit up, darling, and
be dignified.</p>
<p><strong>113 medium shot–interior of brett’s cabin</strong>: Shortie
and Brett. Shortie has the change for Brett’s fifty-dollar bill.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Here y’are. Now don’t take too many chances
on that card game.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: They won’t squawk–they’re professionals.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Well, if that’s the case, you’re sure of
winning the first couple of hands–But what about after that?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: That’s where you come in. Now, listen,
Shortie–</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: And don’t forget–you won’t play cards
because you’ve got a headache. After the three of us get started you can
scram. Give him the come-on–let him win the first few hands. When I give
you the office –Start taking him.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: –that’s what we call double-a grade lumber,
ma’am; You don’t find a knot in a thousand feet.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Isn’t that interesting?</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Hope I didn’t keep you waiting.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, boy–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred
dollars for this check–and bring the cash here.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Yes, Mr. Brett–right away.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Good afternoon–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Glad to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Do you mind if I don’t play? I’ve a beastly
headache.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won’t
have a fourth.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I’m sorry, but you three men can play poker or
something. Shall I see you tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: That’s a date.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: You’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Well, it’ll have to be poker–but I’m so
unlucky in that game.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: If you gentlemen play a heavy game, perhaps
you’d better count me out.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I never play higher than–say a $200
limit.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: We haven’t any chips, Mr. Brett–Do you mind
playing with cash?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll bet a couple of hundred– I wonder what’s
keeping that boy.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Don’t worry about that. We’ll settle after
the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man’s word is all that’s
necessary. What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Three Jacks.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: That beats two Pairs. I’m glad <U>I</U>
didn’t win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well, I’m off to a pretty good start.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: If I ever won a pot that large the boat
would sink.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Well, as I said before, I don’t like to win
the first pot. Out my way in Montana we’re very superstitious–we always
say a good beginning is a bad ending. I hope that won’t apply to
you.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Here’s your twenty-five hundred,
Mr. Brett.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty–here–keep
the change.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll take one.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: One will be enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I should pass, but I’ll trail along–I’ll
take three.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll bet a couple of hundred.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Out my way in Montana we always call a
bluff.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Well, I helped my hand so I’ll have to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Aces full.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: And me coming in with two pair–</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: I thought my straight was O.K., but–</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: It’s your deal.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I
have a message for you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Your mother is feeling seasick and would
like to see you right away.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, is she? What a shame! You’ll pardon
me?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: You’re coming back–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: That depends on how mother’s feeling. You’ll
excuse me, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: How much did you lose?</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: About twelve hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I went for four.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: It’s a long trip and we’ll get that sucker
later.</p>
<p><strong>116 medium close truck shot – brett and shortie</strong>:
Walking down corridor.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: What did you win?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: About sixteen hundred.</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Partners, ain’t we?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sure–and to show you I’m a regular fella–
Here’s that twenty-five hundred.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: See that Miss Sally Marsh gets that bouquet
with my card immediately.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: If there’s any change, keep it.</p>
<p><strong>florist</strong>: Thank you. I’ll attend to it right
away.</p>
<p><strong>117 interior sally’s cabin</strong>: She is standing at a
large bouquet reading the card that is attached.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Isn’t it great to be away from it all? Aren’t
you happy? It seems too good to be true.</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Sure, Sis.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Aren’t the roses beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Hello! … Yes, it is. …</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: This is the ship’s photographer
speaking–could I get a couple of pictures of you for the <U>Radio
News</U>? … Thanks very much … Cabin 4C … Right away? … Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: She’s comin’.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Beat it.</p>
<p><strong>122 lounge</strong>: Brett walks to a table in the lounge. He
looks at his watch. He watches the entrance expectantly. Dan Campbell
enters.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Don’t you hate a pest?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I certainly do–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: So do I. There are times when a fellow likes to
be alone.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’d like to be alone right now.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: So would I. Let’s sit down and talk it
over.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Will you try and locate Miss Marsh,
please?</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>123 lother’s cabin</strong>: There is knock at the door.
Lother opens it in such a way that he is almost behind it. Sally enters.
He closes the door quickly. He smiles. She stands staring at him
speechless. There is a pause.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Well–aren’t you going to say something? I’ve
gone to a lot of trouble to give you this little surprise. Don’t let’s
behave like children. Sit down, Sally. Let’s face the situation.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: All right–but what is there to face? It’s
finished.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: You ran away because you were afraid. I
don’t want it to end like that.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I didn’t want to see you again–that’s my
privilege.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: It wasn’t smart. Even if you’d gotten away
without me –I’d have found you–no matter where you were.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Why don’t you leave me alone?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Because I want you–will always want you–no
other woman’ll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that
first night– You’ve forgotten all that, I suppose?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Get wise to yourself, Sally–you’re no sob
story.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know
what’s good for you, you’ll leave me alone. Everybody’s entitled to one
mistake–Well–you’re mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up
stakes and quit. We stay quit!–Get that!–And what’re you going to do
about it?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: That’s more like the old Sally–a little bit
of fire. How about Ned?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Thanks to me.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You leave the kid alone.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: A tipoff in the right quarter to take his
fingerprints and–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: –you’d go with him!</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Don’t kid yourself–you know how I stand back
there.</p>
<p><strong>124 close shot</strong>: As his fingers trace down the names.
He stops underneath that of Inspector McKinney.</p>
<p><strong>lother’s voice</strong>: Why do you think he’s aboard?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Not because of Ned.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Of course not– –but isn’t it a coincidence
that he’s from the eighteenth precinct–where they made the squawk?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You can’t bluff me any more.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Campbell, but I’m waiting for
someone. I’d appreciate it if you’d–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, there you are–</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s right–you’re the one I was looking for.
You’ll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not now, Toots–Which is the right way to say
this? You’re dumber than me–or–you’re dumber than I?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Let me see now–Don’t tell me– You’re dumber
than me and I’m dumber than you. I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: H’mm … no wonder I have trouble rounding up
this show–Don’t you know there’s a rehearsal going on?– And you wanted a
raise.–Come on–get going or you’ll get it!</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, all right– See you later, Toots.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Nobody is any help to me at ail.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, Denby–have you seen Sally around?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: No–I’m looking for Miss Marsh myself. I
thought you might know where she is–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: She was to meet me here–why don’t you wait?
She ought to be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I would–but our rehearsal starts right away.
Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part
of my show. Some day–not now–when you get a chance–let her come to just
one rehearsal. I’ll appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>126a medium shot–corridor</strong>: Denby meets Ned, on way
to rehearsal room.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Seen Sally?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: She went over to the ship’s photographers.</p>
<p><strong>127 lother’s cabin</strong>: Sally is sitting on the lounge,
Lother next to her. The fight seems to have gone out of her and she
looks desperately unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m crazy about the kid and I got him into
it. What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Just smile again and be reasonable. I’ll
order dinner here–just the two of us–like old times.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: –and you swear when you get to the other
side, you’ll never come near either of us again?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: That’s a bet–but I couldn’t let you walk out
like that, Sally. I’d have gone cuckoo back there–just thinking about
you–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t, Lee–that’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Let’s see if I can bring it back to
life.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: So it’s as cold as that, is it?</p>
<p><strong>128 the door</strong>: It opens quickly and Anya, enters.
Behind her stands Summers. She takes in the situation. An ironical
little smile plays about the corner of her mouth. Summers, behind her,
is signaling to Lother that he couldn’t help it. They enter the
room.</p>
<p><strong>129 full shot</strong>: Anya eyes Lother with a deadly
calm.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Hope we’re not intruding.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: This is Miss Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Yes–I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always
seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What’s the
matter, Miss Marsh–aren’t you feeling well?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Well–shall we go into dinner?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I’ll join you later.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh– –when she’s
had time to tidy up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re Anya Rosson, aren’t you? I’ve heard of
you back in New York.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Sorry I can’t return the compliment.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You were indiscreet enough to leave your
gloves in my apartment one evening– –and he was gentleman enough to
boast <U>why</U> you’d been there and show me a snapshot of you.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I think you do.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I was jealous of you <U>then</U>–I’m
<U>sorry</U> for you now.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: So that’s your little dancer that you were
playing around with in New York. Oh–there’s no accounting for tastes–
Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I can explain–</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Sure! You’re never at a loss for words.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Will you pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Scram!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Don’t look so uncomfortable, Lee–it interferes
with your good looks. Give me a cigarette. What did you do–persuade her
to come on this voyage with you?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Don’t talk such bunk! She’s one of the acts
on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: You mind your own business! She’s an old
friend of mine and I like her–what’re you going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Just make it as difficult as possible for you
to see her.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I didn’t ask you to come away with me–</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Oh–a hundred times–</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: –and I can tell you where to get off.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: And when you do I’ll convey your respects by
wireless to Herbert. Take it easy, Lee–no other woman’ll ever get you.
At least I’m honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low
down in me–because I like you. You’re such a swine!</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Will you leave me alone?</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I like touching you–poison ivy. You’d just
been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Baloney!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: No, darling, lip rouge–all over your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>132 large close shot–anya’s head</strong>: As she bends
slowly toward him.</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: Let me wipe it off for you. I adore you–you
gorilla!</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: And I’m nuts about you– –beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>anya</strong>: I couldn’t live without you!</p>
<p><strong>133 brett and mary–lounge</strong>: Brett is very nervous and
impatient. He paces back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why don’t you answer my question?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I didn’t even hear it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then I’ll repeat it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If spinach makes iron, what makes a boat
<U>rock</U>?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll have to tell that to Denby. He’ll use it
on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I don’t know what it is, but I won’t use it.
Is she entertaining you?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I should say not.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Good! At last you’re making yourself useful.
So long!</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: No, sir–she’s not on the upper deck
either.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thank you. You’ll excuse me, please–</p>
<p><strong>134 medium close</strong>: As Brett exits from scene with
Mary, he sees Sally, who is walking dejectedly.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, Sally!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’m sorry I’m late, but something
happened.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You’re forgiven if you don’t make dates with
anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I must say you’re persistent– –it’s kind of
flattering.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You’re unhappy about something, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Anything I can do? I’d jump overboard if it’d
help you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Mighty decent of you, pal.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Decent? I guess any guy could be decent–if
you were interested.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: A lot of things I’d like to forget.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s funny–so was I. Guess the ocean makes
one sentimental</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I can’t blame the ocean–it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You don’t know anything about me. If you did,
you probably wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Can you keep a secret? You’re the first girl
I ever met I wanted to build a fence around.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t kid me. I’m in no mood for it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: For once I’m dead on the level– –crazy about
you!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Will you take some advice? If you’re looking
for romance–count me out– –if you know what’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: But–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: –I know what I’m talking about. I’m no
high-school girl looking through a window–reaching for the moon. Guess
I’ll be going.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sally–!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Let’s forget it–can’t you see I kind of like
you, too … and I don’t want to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You mean that?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Don’t let’s talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You said it! How about a little action?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>135 reverse angle</strong>: Two stewards–one carrying a tray
of sandwiches, the other, a tray of bouillon–are standing before him.
Brett is oblivious of their presence. The steward places a cup of
bouillon and a sandwich in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>136 close shot of lifeboat</strong>: From the canvas covering

around here–you’ve entertained the audience, and now for a change
they’re going to entertain you– aren’t we?–I’ll sing the chorus up until
I get to the words, “Oh, Leo,” then I’ll put the spotlight on some lady
or gentleman, and whoever the lucky one might be, he or she will then
sing the words, “Oh, Leo–Oh Leo– Oh Leo–Oh–”</p>

the chute,–he repeats this operation with two more napkins. Shortie
almost faints–he takes a napkin from the tray and feels the weight of it
quickly– satisfied that it contains nothing, he throws it down the chute
and grabs the only remaining napkin off the tray. He readily realizes
that this contains the bracelet and jams it quickly into his pocket and
exits.</p>

can’t get away with it on a ship–</p>

place aboard ships–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: It’ll be very interesting to see how you go
about solving this, Inspector–</p>

<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ve lost my taste for knickknacks–</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Don’t be a mug all your life–I’m trying to
help you– you need me more than I need you–have you figured they might
pick the kid up in France and extradite him?</p>

you?</p>

married?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I didn’t <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to
be married.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: You didn’t?–I guess I forgot to tell you–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: You’re a little ahead of yourself–the usual
routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you’d give me
an engagement ring–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll give you plenty of rings as soon as I
get the stones set–what do you think?</p>

<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: How about you?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No, thanks. I’ve promised to play cards.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: You know what I’d do, if I were you–before
the card game I’d go to the Purser’s office.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Well, someone else besides myself may have
seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson’s cabin this evening–even the
stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sure, I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: I’ll go with you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Swell!</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: Well, you insist–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: It’s easy to see the Purser hasn’t had
much practice.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: How about trying your fine Italian hand?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: This has nothing to do with me– But always
remember, Purser, when you’re searching anybody, take the lining of
their coat, like this– –run your fingers all along these seams…. Then–
back of the collar–<U>here</U>–that used to be a favorite trick–and
never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe–like this.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Hey!–you’re tickling me.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Then we run our hands down a man’s arms
and legs– like this–in case they got what you’re looking for attached to
a string. See what I mean, Purser?</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: Very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well, I guess that’s all–good night!</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: He’s certainly good-natured.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: “Smooth’s” the word.</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: I mean–a lot of gentlemen would be offended
if you searched them like that.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: It all depends on what you’re used to.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Well, I’ll be a son of a sea cook!</p>
<p><strong>purser</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Nothin– –I just remembered the name of a
guy that owes me fifty bucks.</p>

on my vacation.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I understand you searched Brett for it last
night. By the way–what do you know about him?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Well, I’ve seen him here and there. What’s
on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Oh, nothing–only I wondered why you suspected
him.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you–we picked him up about
a year ago– but could never pin anything on him.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Maybe he just travels in bad company.</p>

part of the racket–helped him! Now–if you have an appointment

anticipation of the coming race. We hear their merriment coming in over
Denby’s close-up.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Take your places, folks. The winner of this
horse race will be presented with a handsome autographed ocean wave.</p>
<p><strong>208 medium shot</strong>: They are all lined up � la
wheelbarrow. Their positions will naturally be funnier than can be
described here.</p>
<p><strong>209 medium close–sally and dan</strong>: Sally is having
extreme difficulty with her horse . His arms collapse and he falls flat
on his face.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I want a new horse. His front legs are full
of rubber.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too
much of a load.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Who won?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Well, you got the first down–there’s one more
to go. Come on, we’re ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep
stiff.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I was never stiffer in my life.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: All right, folks, get on your mark. When you
hear the pistol shot–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I forgot my gun. I’ll drop this handkerchief
instead– Get ready–One!–Two!–Three!</p>
<p><strong>210 medium long shot</strong>: The passengers watching and
cheering their favorites.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Come on, Sally. Bet you a hundred dollars she
wins!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Wouldn’t bet against her. Tell you what I
will do–bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a
hundred, though–just fifty.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: It’s a bet–come on, Sally!</p>
<p><strong>213 finishing line</strong>: We see the finish of the race.
Dan Campbell slides over the finish line on his nose.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: The winner, Sally Marsh! And– –Dan Campbell–
–wins by a sliver!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Nice girl, that– I’d hate to see
<U>her</U> get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is
they’re <U>too</U> smart. Now if I’d taken that bracelet, I’d find some
way to slip it back–I’d know I could never get ashore with it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Anybody that’s taken the trouble to get it
would be a mug to put it back.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Could I see you a minute?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sure! Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Exciting, wasn’t it? Where’s Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: He’ll be back. What would you do if
anybody gave you a bracelet?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Say, “Thanks very much!”</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: I mean if you knew it were stolen.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Well, of course, I wouldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: And if you liked the person, you’d
naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Sure I would–but I don’t get what you’re
driving at.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Maybe you will after you’ve thought it
over.</p>
<p><strong>217 bar</strong>: Brett, Lother, and Summers
drinking–apparently quite affable.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Well–when are we going to have our little
poker game?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I’ve
sworn off playing poker.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: Why, you wouldn’t quit when you’re ahead,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Why isn’t that a good time to quit?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: No gentleman would do that.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I agree with you–no gentleman, would–But I
would– –especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of
marking the cards.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: I thought you were a sucker–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Think again–</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: In that case–you owe us exactly sixteen
hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Oh, no–I played with <U>your</U> cards–in
<U>your</U> cabin–at <U>your</U> suggestion–If you’ve got a kick coming,
make it to the Purser.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I’m making it to you. If I don’t get it by
tonight–you’ll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: That goes two ways.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Make it three, boys–I’ll play this hand
pat.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: And I’ll lay odds you got that bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll lay odds you get a pair of ’em–Why, a
high-school kid could take you saps–and another thing–Lay off Sally
Marsh. –“Honest Jack”! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons
up its pockets.</p>
<p><strong>218 fade-in</strong>: STEWARD BLOWING THE DINNER BUGLE. NIGHT
BACKGROUND.</p>
<p><strong>219 lifeboat</strong>: The sound of the bugle blowing is
still coming over SOUND TRACK. Ballinger climbs cautiously out– jumps to
the ground, and stretches his cramped limbs. Taking the protection of
the shadows he moves stealthily toward steps.</p>
<p><strong>220 medium shot–barber shop</strong>: Ballinger enters in
evening clothes–gets into barber’s chair.</p>
<p><strong>barber</strong>: Quite a growth, sir–been seasick?</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: Yes–leave the moustache on–</p>
<p><strong>221 dolly back to include another chair</strong>: Which the
barber pulls to upright position, disclosing McKinney sitting there.
McKinney glances over and notices Ballinger.</p>
<p><strong>222 close-up–mckinney</strong>: Recognizing Ballinger–as he
looks at Ballinger, barber puts hot towel over Ballinger’s face. By this
time the other barber is finished with McKinney, who pays him and
exits.</p>
<p><strong>223 exterior of barber shop</strong>: Steward going by
McKinney–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Boy–let me have that radiogram blank–</p>
<p><strong>224 insert</strong>: “Chief of Detectives–New York City–</p>
<p><strong>225 medium shot–dining room</strong>: Ballinger dressed in
tuxedo, glances around, and sinks into seat at table near door–steward
comes in.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Pardon me, sir–that table’s reserved–</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: I’ve been in my cabin–ill–this is the
first time I’ve come to the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: You can sit over here tonight, sir–I’ll
have the Chief Steward allot you a table tomorrow–</p>
<p><strong>226 campbell’s cabin–</strong>: Campbell in his underwear is
excitedly gesticulating to a steward.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I tell you–my dress clothes have been
stolen!–</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: –but I laid ’em out on that bed for you,
sir!</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I know you did! I went to take a shower
and when I came back they’d gone–even the shoes.</p>
<p><strong>227 close-up</strong>: Brett and Sally kissing. They step
apart, showing us Denby, frowning as he watches in background. CAMERA
DRAWS BACK TO CLOSE SHOT Sally as Denby comes into scene, watching Brett
as he goes off.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Serious?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Very serious?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Very–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Why–don’t you like him?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Of course–but– There’s your cue–hurry up–</p>
<p><strong>227 medium close–backstage–denby and lother</strong>: Actors
going on stage which we do not see. Parker’s voice singing <U>Sweet of
You</U> can be heard. Lother walks into Denby who is standing in
wings.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Say, Denby–how soon before Sally’ll be
through? I’ve got a date with her.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I’ll give you another chance to tell the
truth, Lother.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Why don’t you be a good little boy and leave
her alone?</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Oh–I understand you were an important part
of her education when she came to New York.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I just tried to show her the difference
between the squirrels and the skunks.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: You don’t shoot squirrels.</p>
<p><strong>228 herbert rosson’s cabin</strong>: Jealousy has driven him
to despair. He is the victim of his own imagination. A half-empty whisky
bottle and glass are close at hand. The clock on the dressing table
discloses the time–11:30. Rosson is a very different individual from the
quiet businessman we met on the dock. He goes to his valise, takes out a
revolver, loads it carefully, and starts to leave cabin.</p>
<p><strong>228-a backstage</strong>: The music comes to a finish. Denby
exits out of scene applauding � la master of ceremonies, to announce
next act. CAMERA STAYS ON LOTHER– Denby’s voice and the applause of the
audience can be heard.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Oh, Sally!</p>

her costume.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: Are you going to meet the blonde?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s my affair.</p>
<p><strong>lother</strong>: I know he is. You change those clothes and
then come to my cabin. I’ll expect you around twelve o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Not a chance–I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>230 close-up of lother–</strong>: He looks after her and then
grimly walks out in the direction she has taken.</p>
<p><strong>230-a medium close shot</strong>: Brett as Sally enters to
him.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ll change and be with you in ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Make it five.</p>

<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’ll be waiting on deck.</p>

Terrified she goes to door and opens it, letting them in. They see the
dead man. React.</p>
<p><strong>237 close-up reaction of captain and passengers</strong>:
CROWDED IN THE DOORWAY OF SALLY’S CABIN</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He followed me into my cabin, locked the door
and as he started to come toward me I heard two shots–That’s all I
know–</p>
<p><strong>238 long shot–shooting toward door–</strong>: McKinney comes
in through the group to the Captain.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Inspector, for the first time in the
history of this line a passenger has been murdered. Won’t you please
take charge?</p>
<p><strong>239 close-up of mckinney</strong>: He thinks–then suddenly
turns and dashes out of the room.</p>
<p><strong>239-a outside bar</strong>: Dan just coming out as McKinney
runs by. Dan turns and goes back into bar.</p>

<p><strong>243 longer shot–</strong>: McKinney cautiously approaches the
sleeping figure, sticks gun in his back:</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: All right, Joe. Get up out of there.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: Lifted it out of a guy’s cabin last
night.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: What did you want a gun for?</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Is that why you killed Lee Lother?</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: Guess again, copper.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Get moving–</p>
<p><strong>243-a outside bar</strong>: Dan is just coming out of the bar
again as McKinney, holding his gun toward Ballinger passes. Dan turns
and staggers back into the bar.</p>
<p><strong>244 interior sally’s cabin–group as before–</strong>:
McKinney enters with Ballinger, who is now handcuffed.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: All right, spill it!</p>
<p><strong>ballinger</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: A rat with a long tail. Take him
below–I’ll get back to him later. I’ll have to ask you all to leave.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Captain, I want you to get the following
passengers in your office–</p>
<p><strong>248 fade-in</strong>: THE PURSER’S OFFICE The lights of the
cabin are burning. The ship has run into a dense fog. Throughout the
following scene the screaming of the siren is heard intermittently.
Sally is seated facing McKinney, her face drawn after a sleepless night.
McKinney also looks tired. He has undone his tie and loosened his
collar. Now that he is back in harness he doesn’t spare himself.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: That’s the truth–every single word!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: I sincerely hope so–</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Why should <U>I</U> kill him?</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: For a very excellent reason from your own
admission– –I’m not saying you <U>did</U>–but I think you know more than
you’re telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust
circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there’s plenty of
it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thought you might need me–don’t talk, kid,
and don’t let him scare you–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Don’t be too smart, Jimmy–you’re out in
the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours
before he was killed–but I’ll deal with that later–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Where were you when the murder
happened?</p>
<p><strong>summers</strong>: In my cabin playing solitaire.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Oh, you couldn’t get a friendly little
poker game together, eh? Still sticking to the same story, Marsh?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Yes, Yes!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: You didn’t have a gun in your hand last
night?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: S’pose you’ve never thought of killing
him–</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I wouldn’t say that– I’m glad he’s dead–yes–I’d
thought of killing him– but I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: Because I was yellow, I guess–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Don’t get yourself all worked up–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: You keep out of this– You admit you
thought of killing him–how were you going to do it?</p>
<p><strong>ned</strong>: I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: This is interesting– Why didn’t you tell
me you gave this kid your gun last night?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: He asked for a loan of it, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yes–but I didn’t give it to him–</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Is this your gun?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Mmmmmmmmmhm…. Now, Jimmy, what were you
doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Why, I–</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Just before the shots! Why, he was with
me–backstage –we ran down together when we heard them.</p>
<p><strong>250 long shot–door bursts open</strong>: A steward enters–he
is <U>very</U> excited.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: The lady in cabin–has been killed!</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Are you sure?–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’s right, Inspector!–</p>
<p><strong>rosson</strong>: She’s dead!–I killed <U>Lother</U> too!</p>
<p><strong>251-a close shot–denby–ned–sally</strong>: Denby enters scene
where Ned is standing with his arm around Sally.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Take her to her cabin–she’s all in.</p>
<p><strong>251aa close shot corner of purser’s office–brett</strong>:
AND DENBY–</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Thanks for establishing an alibi for me. If
that guy hadn’t confessed I would have been on the grill plenty, and I
don’t think I could have weathered it. Get me? Any time I can do
<U>you</U> a favor don’t hesitate to ask for it.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: I won’t–I’ll ask for one right now. Sally
tells me she’s in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: She did?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: Yes–but don’t ask me why–because I could
never tell you. I don’t know what most guys want out of life–but
<U>that</U> would be enough for me–I wouldn’t care about– easy
money–or–showing off my smart brains–I’d just like to live <U>my</U>
life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>–Do I make
myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Very clear. That’s one favor I’ll be glad to
do you.</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: O.K., kid– I’m only sorry for one thing.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>denby</strong>: If you hadn’t agreed–I was going to throw you
overboard–</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Hello, Jimmy. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Listen, Runt–Quick! Where’s the ice?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: Why–I–er thought with all this heat turned
on I’d hide it.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Where did you hide it?</p>
<p><strong>shortie</strong>: On the drunk.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Get it!</p>
<p><strong>251-b medium shot-dan-staggering down corridor.</strong>:
Shortie follows him.</p>

CLOSE SHOT–CAPTAIN OF SHIP AND MCKINNEY</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, Inspector–now that that’s over–you
can go back to your vacation.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Not quite yet. There’s still a loose
bracelet floating around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>252 close-up–bracelet</strong>: CAMERA DOLLIES BACK TO BRETT
AND SALLY</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: There comes a time in every guy’s life when
he has to stand off and take a look at himself. I’ve been doing that
tonight–and what I saw is pretty phony.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Now you know. If you have an appointment
elsewhere–I’ll excuse you.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney’s voice</strong>: Sorry to intrude.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Soon as I get that bracelet back I’m going
to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out–I got to win
that fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: I’ve got a hunch you’re going to win that
bet, Inspector.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do
without me. I’ll be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’m going to return the bracelet right now
and face the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well, I’ll be–!!!</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>254 medium shot–mckinney</strong>: BACK TO CAMERA is walking
down the deck. We catch a flash of the bracelet as he tosses it in the
air.</p>
<p><strong>brett’s voice</strong>: Hey–wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Here’s your fifty.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Thanks. That makes us square.</p>
<p><strong>mckinney</strong>: Next time I get a vacation I’ll spend it
at headquarters. Good-night.</p>
<p><strong>sally</strong>: He’s a swell person. He told me he’d rather
turn one guy straight than jug a million.</p>
<p><strong>255 quick flash—the show going on</strong>: Chorus, fast
tempo, etc. SUPERIMPOSE Denby at microphone.</p>
