the press are gathered around BILL GLUCKMAN, his wife BESS and daughter
BRENDA who are on the porch of their 12,000-square-foot mansion.</p>

<p><strong>tom</strong>: Thank you for all your questions, but we’ve run
out of…</p>
<p><strong>2 continued: 2</strong>: The Escalade rolls into the
driveway, hopping up and down on its amped-up hydraulics like something
from Crenshaw Boulevard on a Friday night. The rear doors pop open and
MOCHA , dressed head to toe in hip-hop gear, steps out of the passenger
side.</p>
<p><strong>mocha</strong>: Yo yo yoooo! Listen up, y’all!</p>

<p><strong>3 int. mansion - den - 15 minutes later 3</strong>: Bill
Gluckman’s election team work the phones as Tom paces; Bill stares out
the window, lost.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s the damage?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: We’re down nine points in the polls.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: In fifteen minutes?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: And dropping.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: It’s a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What’s the spin?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I called the Times and the Chronicle, they’re
gonna play the whole thing off as a joke.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How the hell did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I have no idea. I thought he was out of
town.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Jen, I gave you specific orders to get some
handlers and keep Brad locked down until after the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: I did! They flew to the ranch in Maui last
night!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maui?! Wasn’t he at the villa in South
Hampton?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I thought he was at the chalet in Aspen.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Nope… It was the compound in Bermuda.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Oh for God’s sake! Can’t we –</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yo, Pops, that was off the hizzook! I just got
you another million votes right dare!</p>
<p><strong>3 continued: 3</strong>: Brad’s pants are so baggy, they fall
to his ankles, exposing his boxers. Brad pulls them up.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What are you doing here, son?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: I knew I had to show up in order for you to
blow up. So I had Captain Tony fire up the Lear jizzy and booya! I’m in
da hizzy, gonna be on the campaign trizzy, 24/seven, you know, kissin’
babies and whatnot. Pound it!</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Bill, you’ve got to shut this down, now. Tell
Brad he can’t work with you, period.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, no. I love his enthusiasm… It’s just a
little misguided. There must be something he can do for the campaign,
where he can’t hurt us.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Such as…?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t know… phones, stuffing envelopes,
making signs, something.</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. hancock park - back yard - day 4</strong>: Bill is at
the end of a stirring speech to the Women’s Organization of
California.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: … in Bill Gluckman’s administration, women
will have better health care, women will have better day care, and women
will have better jobs! From here on in, my campaign has a new
slogan!</p>
<p><strong>in wings</strong>: Tom signals Brad, who enthusiastically
yanks a cord, and we…</p>
<p><strong>wide shot - huge banner</strong>: unfurls behind Bill. It is
spray-painted graffiti-style, and reads: “BILL GLUCKMAN’S DOWN WITH THE
BITCHES AND</p>
<p><strong>in wings</strong>: Brad looks on proudly; Tom closes his
eyes, a migraine kicking in.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. limo - day 5</strong>: An angry mob of women chase the
limo as it backs down the driveway full speed.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Bill Gluckman’s down with the bitches and
ho’s’?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: It was supposed to read, ‘Women are first with
Gluckman.’</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: That’s old school. Pops, you got to keep your
pimp hand strong.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. gluckman mansion - day 6</strong>: The limo pulls in.
Bill, Tom and Brad get out.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Peep y’all later. I’ma go work on my new
campaign rhyme, ‘Election Erection.’ It’s gonna be large! Yo! I’ma start
on a new sign.</p>
<p><strong>6 continued: 6</strong>: He heads for the house.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: That’s it, Bill. If Brad doesn’t straighten up,
your political career is finished.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: No, Tom. I promise you, I will not lose this
election over my son.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Set up an appointment with my shrink.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. psychiatrist’s office - day 7</strong>: Plush. Brad
sits unhappily on an overstuffed couch opposite DR. FELDMAN. Bess and
Bill sit off to the side.</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: So… Bradley…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why you keep callin’ me dat?</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Well that’s your name, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s my slave name, a’ight? I told you like
fi’ty times.</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Yes, okay… B-Rad…</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Wassup?</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Let’s play an association game.</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Alright, B-Rad. I want you to look at
these…</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Now, which one doesn’t belong?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Shoot. N.W.A., fool. They broke up a long time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a gang member.
You’re from Malibu, you live in a nice home…</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: With nice maids!</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Bill, Bess, go to your happy
places.</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: What are your goals, B-Rad? What do you
want out of life?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: To be the biggest rapper dere ever was! See, I
got something to say, and I need the world to hear it. I’m the shiznit.
I’ll buy y’all cars!</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: I see. And when did you first start
feeling like you were this… shiznit?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh, damn… way back in the day. I’ve had these
beats in my head since I was a little shortie…</p>
<p><strong>8 flashback - int. gluckman living room - day 8</strong>:
Toddler Brad sits on the floor, playing with a toy as GLADYS, Brad’s
housekeeper vacuums, while listening to her Walkman. The PHONE RINGS,
Gladys pulls off her Walkman headphones and answers the RINGING
PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Gluckman residence.</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: No, Bill and Bess are out of the country
until December.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: From then on it was hip-hop 24/seven.</p>
<p><strong>9 int. gluckman dining room - night 9</strong>:
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BRAD sits alone at the table, wearing a Run DMC hat
headphones, around his neck, BLARE NWA.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Finish those vegetables, Bradley.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You can’t be excused until you do.</p>
<p><strong>seven-year-old-brad</strong>: Tch. Forget y’all.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: on the table across from Brad is a video
conference system. Both parents are on separate monitors – Bess’s has a
sign that reads, “Paris,” and Bill’s reads, “Tokyo.” There is a place
setting in front of each monitor, as if they’re dining with him.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s it, mister.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: When we get home… sometime in the near future…
you’re going to be in big trouble!!</p>
<p><strong>9 continued: 9</strong>: Using the remote, Brad changes the
channel on his parents’ monitors to “Yo MTV Raps.”</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: What I’m sensing, Brad, is that your
parents weren’t really there for you.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: That’s ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: What about your bar mitzvah?</p>
<p><strong>11 flashback - int. gluckman mansion - living room - day
11</strong>: Bill and Bess enter with suitcases. The house is crowded
with relatives and Brad’s 13-year-old friends.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Mazel tov, Bradley!</p>
<p><strong>uncle louie</strong>: What’s the theme of your party, kid?
Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes?</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BRAD dressed like Flava
Flav, a big clock around his neck, looking like he’s just smelled a
fart.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s O.P.P., bitch!</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. gluckman mansion - back yard - same time 12</strong>:
It’s like we’ve suddenly stepped into a hard-core rap video –
big-bootied home girls in bikinis freak with clean-cut Jewish kids as
the staff serve barbecue and malt liquor to the freaked-out guests.
Among them, we see a 13-year-old HADJI, MONSTER, and MOCHA, all nicely-
dressed for temple. Above, a huge spray-painted banner reads: “MAZEL
TIZZOV B-RAD, ON HIS BAR MITZVAH!”</p>
<p><strong>13 omitted 13</strong>: &amp; &amp; 14 14</p>
<p><strong>15 int. psychiatrist’s office - day 15</strong>: Bess
sniffles and dabs her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Bess, I’m sensing you’d like to
share.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: B-Rad, you’re a wonderful son… it’s just that,
well –</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Oh stop beating around the bush, Bess. What
we’re trying to say is, Brad, that your behavior is, well, it’s an
embarrassment to the family.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yo, Pops, that hurts my feelings.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m sorry, but it’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Don’t be hatin’.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: And, Brad… I can’t have you on the campaign
any longer.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What?! Oh that’s how it is? A’ight then. I’m
Audi! I need to take a drive.</p>
<p><strong>15 continued: 15</strong>: Brad leaves, slamming the door
behind him.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: What can we do, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: Well, his lack of parental guidance
left Brad wide open to outside influence, allowing hip- hop culture to
firmly imprint on his psyche.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Do you think we can bring him back?</p>
<p><strong>dr. feldman</strong>: I don’t know. This is the most advanced
case of gangsta-phrenia I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Oh no, not gangsta-phrenia!</p>
<p><strong>a15 ext. gluckman back yard - poolside - day a15</strong>:
Brad relaxes in a lounge chair, wearing sunglasses and sipping on a
forty. Bess enters wearing a Chanel suit. She sits on the lounge chair
next to him.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Bradley, I know you’re busy, but we need to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: After our therapy session I realized that your
father and I could have been better parents. We neglected you and I feel
terrible.</p>
<p><strong>14a.</strong>: MALIBU’S MOST WANTED - Rev. 8/22/02</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: For real?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Yes. So from here on out I’m going to be a
better mother. I want to get closer to you… be there for you. If ever
you need –</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Hello? Celeste! When did you get back?! What?!
Oh my God! I’ve been waiting for that bag for six months! It’s my
personal shopper. Stay right there. I’m on my way!</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: So… where we… Oh yes. I’m always here for you,
Bradley. Do you have my cell number?</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. gluckman mansion - patio - noon 17</strong>: Brad
sits at the massive dining room table as Gladys pours him a big glass of
grape juice, then cuts up his food.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Gladys?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Ever feel like you don’t belong?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: All the time, baby. Most folks only feel
comfortable around folks who are the same as them. When they meet
someone different, they get scared and angry, wanna keep ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What do you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Nothin’ to do but keep it real. Be proud of
who you are.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yeah, you right… Gladys, when they gonna leave
our people alone?</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: I don’t know, baby, I just don’t know… Eat
your greens before they get cold, boy.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Oh no, not again!</p>
<p><strong>18 int. campaign headquarters - war room - day 18</strong>:
Bill, Tom, the staff, and several AIDES of varying ethnicity are
mid-meeting.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: How’d it go with Feldman?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Great news. If he sees Brad five days a week,
he says we’ll see improvement in three to four years.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: But… the election’s in two months.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Right, good point.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: We’ve been brainstorming on some different
approaches, and I think we may have something solid here.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Guys?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Brad might act ‘ghetto,’ but let’s face it,
he’s never been east of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: But what if we give him a little dose of
reality?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Let him get a firsthand look at the
ghetto.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You mean, have Brad actually… go there?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Sounds dangerous…</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: It’ll be perfectly safe.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: How does it work?</p>
<p><strong>jen</strong>: We hire actors to play gangsters.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: They car-jack Brad, then take him on a ‘tour’
of the ’hood… give him a little taste of what thug life’s really like.
It might just scare the black out of him.</p>
<p><strong>18 continued: 18</strong>: Tom gets strange looks from
everyone.</p>
<p><strong>african-american aide</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Look, I’m as down as the next brother, guy…
fellah. I grew up in Compton, okay? But let’s get over the P.C. thing
and face facts. Unless we do something soon, Brad’s gonna cost us this
election.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: I don’t know… it sounds so drastic.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is
twenty-four. I mean, what’s he gonna do for a living, rap?</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Who do we get for the gangsters?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last
month?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: We’ve got it cued up.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. ghetto basketball court - day 19</strong>: A young,
black gangbanger , glares at camera.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For too long, street violence has torn
Californians apart…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Bill Gluckman wants to put our divisions
behind us.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Fellas, instead of thinking of yourselves as
what set you’re from, or what crew you’re rolling with, why can’t you
both be brothers. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I guess we never thought of each other like
that.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Me neither, dawg.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: You see… ‘California is my family’…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: If we work together as a family there’s no
telling how high we can go.</p>
<p><strong>18 back to scene 18</strong>: As they talk we see Brad, out
the window, raising a banner.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Those are our guys, right there.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Will he be safe?</p>

<p><strong>20 int. mali-brew - day 20</strong>: Brad urgently runs into
the Mali-Brew Coffee Shop , where he and his crew spend ninety percent
of their time. He is stopped at the door by a very worried Mocha and
Monster.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Lemme go.</p>
<p><strong>mocha</strong>: You don’t want to see him like dis.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mocha</strong>: He O.D.’d again.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Why didn’t you stop him?</p>
<p><strong>monster</strong>: I tried, yo!</p>

<p><strong>mocha</strong>: Like twelve, thirteen, I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo’s. Brotha’s caffeined
out. Move aside.</p>
<p><strong>20 continued: 20</strong>: Brad pushes past and looks on in
horror at Hadji, pacing and talking to himself like a rabid dog on angel
dust.</p>
<p><strong>hadji</strong>: I’ma get mine! Step, fool! I’ll cut you, I
swear!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Just chill, Hadji, we’re here to help. What’s
up?</p>
<p><strong>hadji</strong>: I… I… I was pickin’ up aromatherapy candles
at Illuminations for Moms, right? And the counter trick gave me lemon
when I specifically axed for lilac!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: It’s on now!</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: PUBLIC ENEMY’S “Fight The Power” KICKS IN as
we –</p>
<p><strong>a20 ext. mali-brew - day a20</strong>: Brad, followed by his
crew, exit, ready for battle.</p>
<p><strong>b20 int. mall - day b20</strong>: We’re still listening to
“FIGHT THE POWER,” only now it’s a Muzac version, piped in through the
mall’s PA SYSTEM. Brad, Hadji, Monster and Mocha strut through the mall.
Rich shoppers get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>c20 int. mall - illuminations - moments later c20</strong>:
Brad and his crew approach the OLD WOMAN CASHIER.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Yo, fool! We got some hard-core drama ’bout to
go down right neow!!</p>
<p><strong>hadji</strong>: Dat’s right!</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dis is our mall. Always was and always will
be!</p>
<p><strong>mocha</strong>: Woof woof!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Oh, Mr. Amiraslani. I’m so glad you came
back. Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles.
Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: You better be validatin’ my parking?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Of course, sir.</p>
<p><strong>brad</strong>: Dat’s what I’m talkin’ ’bout. We get ours!</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. parking lot - day 21</strong>: Tom, standing by a
limo, is speaking with Sean and PJ, dressed as their actual, preppy
selves.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Hold the phone, buddy… you want us to scare
this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Don’t think you can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Of course I can handle it. I studied at
Juilliard for God’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Here’s some background information on Brad.</p>
<p><strong>insert - cd cover</strong>: It is Brad, throwing the Malibu
sign, surrounded by women in thongs with gigantic asses. The title, in
graffiti font, reads: “MALI-BOOTAY!”</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Malibootay?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: He considers himself a ‘rapper.’</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Frickin’ A.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Okay, so here’s the story – it’s your basic
kidnapping…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: So we hold him for ransom?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Right. But when you see him acting ghetto and
all, it pisses you off so much, you tour him around the ’hood to show
him what things are really like. I had my guys brainstorm a few
ideas…</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: ‘Mugging, drive-by shooting, crack deal gone
bad…’</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Why don’t you have him steal some watermelon
while you’re at it?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Pays fifteen grand apiece.</p>
<p><strong>sean and pj</strong>: We’re in.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Wait – we’re kidnapping him, couldn’t we get
arrested?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Got you covered. Mr. Gluckman’s a billionaire –
if you run into any problems with the law, we’re very close with the
commissioner. On the flip side, if you screw up and a single hair is
touched on Bradley’s over-privileged head, I will make sure that you do
serious time. Clear?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Cris… tal.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: What about the money?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Five up front, twenty-five when you return him
to us, white.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: … As the driven snow.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Congrats, my brother. We just booked another
gig.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Yeah, but it’s totally dangerous, dude. You
know what it’s like in the ’hood. We could get shot!</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: We can handle ourselves. Come on, man, it’s the
ultimate acting challenge.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You know what really chaps my ass? After years
of training and study, the only parts they’ll give us are gangbangers.
Just once I’d like to play a character who has decent grammar and
doesn’t wear Timberlands.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Beats gettin’ dunked on by Bill Gluckman.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Do we even know anybody down there?</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: My cousin.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Shondra.</p>

got better things to do with my time, boy.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Like work at Wienie In A Bun?</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Really. You’re the one always talkin’ about
improvin’ yourself.</p>
<p><strong>shondra</strong>: I am improvin’ myself, fool. I broke up
with no-good gang-bangin’ Tec, I’m going to beauty school, then I’ma
hook up my own salon…</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: In the meantime, how about hooking a brother up
with a Pepsi and some fries?</p>
<p><strong>shondra</strong>: Shut up, stupid.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Do this, Shondra. You’ll get some real money
so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business.</p>
<p><strong>shondra</strong>: What you payin’?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: A grand.</p>
<p><strong>shondra</strong>: Make it trey, we on.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Jesus Christ, three grand?</p>
<p><strong>shondra</strong>: Or you can kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Deal. Now how about those fries?</p>

<p><strong>pj</strong>: Glocks, Uzis, Tec-9s…</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Oh, my hair? Shondra just did it. What? You hate
it?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: No. I just think it’s a choice my character
would have made.</p>

didn’t think of it first.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Whatever.</p>

<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>

ass!</p>
<p><strong>a22 continued: a22</strong>: WIDEN to reveal PJ watching
Sean, shaking his head.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Nope, you’re not convincing me. Remember your

one. Lemme try it again. Gimme your ride, punk, or I will dust yo

run on the heels of a tragedy?</p>
