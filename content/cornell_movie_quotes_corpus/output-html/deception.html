<p><strong>extreme close on a cell phone</strong>: resting face up on a
black surface. A beat of silence – is broken by its abrupt RING… RING…
RING… Move in tighter on the phone’s LCD DISPLAY. A number comes up:
555-3827 RING… RING… RING… A hand enters frame. We follow it to a pad
and pen we now discover to the left of the phone. The hand picks up the
pen, brings it to the pad, on which we find a list of handwritten
numbers. At least fifty. To this series is now added 555-3827. RING…
RING… RING…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Do-you have tomorrow’s Times yet? The
grizzled OLD MAN behind the counter doesn’t look up.</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: It is tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Right. I forgot. The Old man grudgingly
bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers. As he does,
Jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display. Naked women
smile back at him –</p>
<p><strong>old man</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Uh - no. No that’s it, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Jonathan! The voice from nowhere
startles him - he spins to find SOLANGE , a vibrant Haitian woman with a
thick accent, standing in the doorway below, bundled in a ski
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Solange, you’re up so late?</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: So early, Jonathan. We open in one
hour.</p>
<p>****: So tell me, you have been out with a lady friend, oui?</p>
<p>****: Je suis desole, madame, mais no.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: But why else does a young man come home at
such an hour?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Just working late, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Every night working late, working late. Ah,
you can’t fool me. You are Mister Mischief maker - I know this! You come
by</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: later and pick out something for your lady
friend, oui?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me. Fixing his coffee, Jonathan
reaches past them. They barely give him a glance as they continue their
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer 1</strong>: So, the Knicks win last night?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer 2</strong>: I’m pretty sure, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually, they lost by 4. Both pause, turn
to Jonathan. Jonathan smiles awkwardly.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It was supposed to be a good game
though.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer 1</strong>: Oh. Hey, so. did you get a chance to look
over that memo from Watkins?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: politely at those he passes; few bother
to smile in return.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Take a look at this. The voice sounds
youthful, energetic. Its owner slides his Journal along the floor
halfway between the marble division.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: The Japanese are developing a toilet
that can analyze your urine for glucose levels, kidney disease, even
cancer. They’re referring to it as the “super bowl.”</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That certainly is - something.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Of course if you’ve ever been to Japan,
you know they’re nuts about their toilets. I’m talking web sites,
symposiums… Jonathan chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: You think I’m kidding. They have bowls
over there that cost more than a piano. What I want to know is how
you’re supposed to retrieve this analysis - you know, from your super
bowl.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe they’re developing a fly with a
nursing degree. A superfly.</p>
<p>****: Who’s in there anyway?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Uh, Jonathan Messer.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Messer… What department?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: None. I’m from Worth and Berman. I’ve been
over here a few wee– A FLUSH from the next stall cuts him off. The sound
of zipping up, of a belt buckled, then of a stall door opening.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: So you’re an accountant? Jonathan
follows the FOOTSTEPS, now addresses his stall door.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Audit manager, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: So how’s it work, Rutherford Stern hires
Worth and Berman to give their blessing to our books, and they send
you?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Have laptop, will travel. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well, I didn’t get your name for one.th–
The SOUND OF A FAUCET RUNNING drowns him out.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: .ose.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sorry - I didn’t catch that? Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I said it’s Wyatt. Wyatt Bose. Jonathan
FLUSHES, buckles his belt, opens his stall door - - only the men’s room
is now empty.</p>
<p><strong>compuvoice</strong>: Message-four. Three-oh-eight-pee-em.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Jonathan? Chet Peterson. Just wanted to-
confirm you’re wrapping up over there at Rutherford Stern because the
controller at Clancey has been on me to get someone in there by
Thursday. I told him how brilliant you are, said you’re the best auditor
we’ve got. Anyway, I forwarded you some documentation… Jonathan clicks
his mouse - to find 27 a-mails ending in worth&amp;berman.com. He
reaches for his palm pilot, clicks on a day planner, stylus writes
“Clancey” into next week. Other than places he’ll be working,
days-are-all entirely blank.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: 12:53 a.m. Startled, Jonathan turns to a
well-dressed young man in the’ doorway - penetrating eyes, playful
smile, familiar voice:</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Sorry if I scared you. I was heading home and
saw the lights. We met before, in the can…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sure. It’s Wyatt, right? WYATT BOSE nods
as he steps into the room. There’s something very likeably “on” about
him.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: So do you normally work this late?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Pretty much. I’m supposed to be out of
here by tomorrow so I’m just trying to finish up. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You kidding? This is an early night. Hard to
believe that once upona time a man’s success was measured by how little
he had to work. You know in Sweden the average worker gets 7 weeks a
year vacation? Do-you like accounting?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It’s all right, if you enjoy working with
numbers. Do you like being a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: It’s all right. If you enjoy working with
assholes. Jonathan laughs, glances at his monitor screen.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Well, I’m probably disturbing you -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No - it’s okay. Really.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: So Worth and Berman, huh? Don’t you have to
like be in Mensa to work there? Jonathan smiles, shrugs modestly.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Been with them long?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Since my senior year of college. They
subsidized my graduate degree.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Really. So you were poor? Jonathan is given
pause by the bluntness of the question.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well - I guess you could say that. I was
raised by a single mother, and she died when I was nineteen, so… yeah.
It wasn’t so bad though. I’m sure a lot of people have had it worse.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Not around here. Practically every suit I
know is Harvard by way of Andover.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Me? Hell no… I’m Princeton. By way of Exeter.
Jonathan laughs. Wyatt smiles, takes a few idle paces.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: So. Jonathan.</p>
<p>****: What do you say to a break?</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CLOSE ON A SCREENSAVER OF SWIMMING FISH.
Tilt up from Jonathan’s laptop screen to Wyatt and Jonathan, sitting on
top of the expensive conference-table, passinga joint, staring out at
the rain hammering the far windows.</p>
<p>****: .It’s just sometimes I feel so - I don’t know - removed. I
mean, I work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world,
and.there’s not so much as a desk there to prove it? They’ve decided all
we need are cell phones and laptops. Messages are voice-mailed,
documents e-mailed, salary’s deposited online. Chet Peterson, my senior
manager? I swear he wouldn’t recognize me if I was sitting in his chair.
Jonathan pauses, takes another drag, train of thought drifts:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I don’t know… I used to have friends. But
it’s like I’ve spent so much time trying to prove myself, working these
hours - you can only do it so long before you look up and realize you’ve
lost</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: everyone. Just - fell out of touch. With
everyone… And I try to meet people at work. I do. But it’s always the
same. To the accounting staff I’m a pain because for two weeks they have
to hold their breath and hope I don’t pick up on any of their screw ups.
And to everyone else, I’m just a temporary fixture, so why bother? The
truth is, this is the first meaningful conversation I’ve had in I don’t
know how long. It’s like if I disappeared tomorrow, I’m not .sure anyone
other than Solange would even notice - she’s my neighbor. I live on what
must be the only block in Brooklyn that still isn’t hip.</p>
<p>****: I guess I just never counted-on the isolation. It’s like
sometimes I look through that glass, and I see life literally passing me
by. Jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Jonathan?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: By the clock on the wall there? You’ve</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s pov</strong>: the entire station is a blur, all
unfocused, muted colors, no object discernible from another - - until
his glasses return his POV to immediate focus, and he sees the same
Young Woman in’the camel.hair coat, a pair of dollar bills in her hand,
entering the station. Jonathan can’t help but stare again. Despite her
business attire, there’s an almost childlike lightness. to her step.
Jonathan notices her slim briefcase. Beneath her hand, he can make out
the first letter of a monogram: “S.” She checks out the long line for
Metrocards, considers waiting, then decides life’s too short. She
continues past, headed for the turnstiles. Jonathan continues to observe
as she raises her briefcase, then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame
through the narrow gap in the turnstile. A PANHANDLER on the other side
watches her with amusement. Glancing up, she catches his eye, and
blushes a mischievous smile. Once she’s through, she drops her money
into his collection - and slips out of view. ANGLE ON JONATHAN, still
stuck on line, staring at the space she vacated.</p>
<p><strong>ii s • ii</strong>: Excuse me, is this the train for canal
Street? It takes Jonathan a second just to find his voice. She’s even
more arresting up close.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Uh,.either one is – I mean the N and the R
both stop there so, you know, either way, I mean, this is the right
train. Yes. SOS Of Thanks. “S” enters her car. Jonathan wavers, wants to
follow into her car but doesn’t have the nerve. He enters a different
car.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Next stop Canal Street. Canal is next. He
sees “S” rising to join the small crowd gathering by a door. Jonathan
stands up - his last chance. Determined, he braces himself and rises,
grasping his briefcase. The screeching of brakes as the train grinds
into “CANAL ST.</p>
<p><strong>station.”</strong>: A sudden JOLT of the braking train.causes
Jonathan to stumble slightly and his briefcase BANGS against a seat and
SNAPS OPEN - contents tumbling out. His cell phone hits the floor.
Jonathan quickly bends for his phone - when the train lurches to a halt,
nearly knocking him over, and sliding his cell phone a few feet along
the grimy floor. O.S. we hear the hiss of the doors opening as Jonathan
grabs for his phone a second before it’s stepped on. He hurriedly stuffs
it in his pocket, shoves his files and papers and paraphernalia back
into his briefcase and rises to his feet - - to find the doors closing,
and “S” gone.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Devastated, he hurries to a window,
searching the platform as the train begins to depart… He can just
glimpse the back of her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a
tunnel. He stands helpless, just shuts his eyes and lowers his head.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I guess that’s it. then. Nice meeting
you.</p>
<p><strong>assistant controller</strong>: Uh huh. Jonathan turns to go,
takes two paces - then turns back.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Listen - could you point me toward Wyatt
Bose’s office? The Assistant Controller looks up in mild annoyance.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt Bose. He’s an attorney here. She
sighs, put upon, then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page
of names and extensions is taped. Jonathan’s eyes follow her lazy finger
down the list –</p>
<p><strong>a gruff voice</strong>: Hey, quit looking down her shirt!
Jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk, turns to find Wyatt
grinning at him from down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Leaving, huh? So where to next?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Clancey Funds on Thursday. Clute Nichols
after that. Wyatt’s about to reply - when ANOTHER LAWYER passes him in
the hall. Wyatt taps the lawyer’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Hey, wait up a sec. Well, good meeting you,
Jonathan. ,Wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer.
Jonathan bends for his briefcase -</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Wait, so you have off tomorrow? Jonathan
looks up to Wyatt smiling at him from down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You don’t happen to have .a. decent backhand,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>same scene - later</strong>: A good rally underway. Jonathan
fires a backhand. Wyatt returns it with an audible grunt. Jonathan snaps
the ball back to Wyatt’s partner - only Wyatt intercepts, nailing it
back. Jonathan returns it with equal force. A grin on Wyatt’s face as he
savors the battle, blasting back each ball. The women step aside.
Jonathan lunges, barely managing to lob a return. Sensing victory, Wyatt
raises his racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball.
Jonathan dives, racket over-extended - and returns a near perfect shot
just over Wyatt’s head… but it lands two inches outside the opposite
baseline.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Out!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan curls forward, gasping for air.
Silence - then Wyatt’s SOLITARY APPLAUSE echoes in the humid space.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Commiserations, Messer. Good game. They shake
hands at the net. Jonathan is exhausted.</p>
<p>****: Develop akiller instinct and you’ll beat the crap out of me.
Jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner - but she’s already gone
to join her friend. Jonathan crashes out on the court. From his low
angle he watches as Wyatt goes over to the girls and says something that
causes a burst of laughter. The girls finally wave goodbye. Wyatt hops
over the net.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: They asked if we’d fancy a post-game
cocktail. Don’t worry, I got us out of it. Jonathan is barely able to
speak.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh? I would’ve been happy to.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Are you kidding? They’re a couple of first
years at Merrill. Screw that, we can do better. Hey, you OK? Jonathan
nods as an amused Wyatt helps him to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Man, I remember when these first came out. I
think I was a frosh at boarding school. Jeez, are these strings natural
gut?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually, it’s a hybrid weave: natural gut
and Kevlar. They’re pretty obscure now. I should replace them, they’re
all frayed…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Looking up, Jonathan abruptly slows his
pace, his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the
bar. From behind, it looks remarkably like “S”… Only, as she turns, her
profile proves otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Have you ever considered contacts? Jonathan
halts, confused to find Wyatt studying his face - his eyeglasses in
particular.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Huh? Oh - yeah, I tried once, but I was
allergic to something in the solution.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Too bad. You have an attractive face. Your
eyes especially. Jonathan looks self-conscious in his towel.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: It’s not a come on, just an observation. You
don’t get much, do you.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What - you mean sex?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: No, flood insurance. How many women have you
slept with?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, not a whole-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Of course you know. Everyone knows.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe - four.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Maybe four?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Okay fine, just four. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Me? I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What? You just said everyone -</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I meant everyone like you. Confused, Jonathan
looks up – as Wyatt disappears into a shower stall.</p>
<p><strong>same - moments later</strong>: Jonathan emerges freshly
showered, a towel around his waist as he walks toward the rows of
lockers.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Tonight?… Fine. I’m on the list? Jonathan
finds Wyatt half-dressed, seated on a bench by a locker and talking on
his cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: There better be. Wyatt hangs up, looks up to
find Jonathan staring, puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Something wrong? Jonathan reaches into his
locker for his hanging jacket, and pulls out his own cell phone. It’s
identical to Wyatt’s.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: We have the same phone.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Oh - and you thought I was using yours? I can
afford my own phone calls, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No, I wasn’t – of course you can-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I’m pulling your dick, Jonathan. Actually, I
was just firming up some plans for tonight. Are you free?</p>
<p>****: Me? Sure, I guess - but I don’t want to</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You’re not. What do you say, are you in?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I guess I could go home and change.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: To Brooklyn? Forget it, you can borrow
something of mine.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: t a uten Abend, Herr Kleiner. This way,
Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Like it? It’s a Gerhard Richter. Kleiner
downstairs is a hot shot art dealer - he hooked me up with the gallery
in Munich. Wyatt disappears into the next room. Alone, Jonathan wanders,
pauses by the framed snapshots. The young people in them are like Wyatt
– beautiful, strong, wealthy. Jonathan pauses by one photo in which
Wyatt looks a bit younger, his hair bleached blonde and loosely
spiked.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Talk about a bad look. Startled, Jonathan
quickly turns to find Wyatt standing right behind him,. a slick,
expensive SUIT draped over his arm.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Here, try this one. What?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Nothing, I just hope I can pull it
off.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You hope you can pull it off. You know who
you remind me of? James Getz.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: A guy I roomed with freshman year at
Princeton.. Real smart - witty too, when you loosened him up. Only from
day one, he just didn’t fit in. For starters, he was dirt poor. But it
wasn’t that. See, there was always this boundary - this wall - between
Getz and everyone else. You could argue we laid the foundation, but he
built it. Built it by believing the lie.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What lie?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: That he was any different. The clothes, the
money, the wry anecdotes - it’s all one big masquerade. Anyone can get
in, you’ve just got to wear a costume. But Getz never got that. He
assumed he could never scale the wall, when the truth is he was the only
one guarding it. It never occurred to him his anonymity could be an
asset. No one gets over like the guy who’s just a face, an impression.
We are - all of us - only who we’re perceived to be.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So what happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Who, James Getz? Oh - he killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You’re pulling my dick, aren’t you. Wyatt
turns to him with a grave look… then smirks.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: With both hands. Jonathan can’t help but
laugh as Wyatt hands him the suit.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CLOSE ON A BUFF YOUNG MAN in a vintage
bowler hat. He struts up to us, thumbs in his suspenders:</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: And now, straight from the Cafe Germaine, the
Velvet Rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely Miss Lu Lu
Lamour!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: It’s a little self-conscious, but I thought
you’d get a kick out of it. How’s that suit working out?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh - great, actually.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Keep it then. I’ve got two just like it.
Jonathan’s about to protest, when a WAITRESS arrives.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy,
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Isn’t this like fifty bucks a glass?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: We’ll try not to spill any. So what’s the
wildest thing you’ve ever done? Sexually, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The wildest thing? Oh I don’t know, I’ve
never been too adventuresome.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: All right, what’s the lamest thing then?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The lamest… Wyatt’s focused on him,
amused, eager to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually, that was probably a few months
ago. I was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the
back. It read something like “Are. you feeling all alone? Looking to
meet women but have forgotten how?” And-there was this number.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: And you called it? So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Nothing actually. The phone just kept
ringing. And that’s it. Wyatt stares at Jonathan a beat, then starts to
crack up.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Lame enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You called a sex ad - from Money Magazine.
That is beyond lame. Jonathan too starts laughing - when the phone at
their table lights’up. Wyatt looks to Jonathan, raises a brow - then
picks up. He listens a moment, smiles, hands it to Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: .Hello? Wyatt taps his shoulder, directs
his gaze to a SEXY BRUNETTE at a distant table, receiver to her ear,
eyeing Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: .All right… Goodbye. Jonathan hangs up,
turns to Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: She wants to dance.</p>
<p><strong>on the dance floor - later</strong>: Jonathan is slow dancing
with the sexy Brunette to an old Edith Piaf ballad. He looks over her
shoulder to his table, where Wyatt is sitting, talking on his cell
phone. Glancing up, Wyatt’s eyes meet Jonathan’s; he flashes a proud
smile. Jonathan continues dancing, truly enjoying himself. The Brunette
leans in, whispers something in his ear…</p>
<p><strong>back to wyatt and jonathan’s table</strong>: Wyatt clicks off
his cell phone, looks up to find Jonathan returning alone, looking
deflated.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: She’s a hooker. Wyatt shrugs,
grinning.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hold on - you knew? What - are all the
women here prostitutes?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: That depends on what you mean by that word.
Stretch the definition and you could incorporate most of the men as
well. You know in Amsterdam prostitutes not only belong to a union, they
have to pay taxes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You seem to possess quite a store of
international trivia.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Not really. I just get around… Jonathan,
relax. It’s not like she just shot your dog. I was only trying to help.
Besides, what are you looking for - a relationship? As if you have time
for one? This was your first day off in how long?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Four for me. Face it, we’ve mortgaged our
youth. Pimped out our twenties. But we still have needs. And there’s
nothing shameful about wanting them met.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So you sleep with hookers?</p>
<p>****: Me? Never.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So how do you - meet your needs? Wyatt
studies him a beat, another French love song drifting in the background
as the Emcee introduces a new girl.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: What if I told you… Christ, I sound like an
infommercial.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What were you going to say?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Listen. You don’t think that women have these
same urges? Young women, just like ourselves, successful and working
their asses off to stay that way? You better believe they do.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: And - well - let’s just say, there’s a way…a
way it can be taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You make it sound like a mob hit. Wyatt
smiles, and turns his attention back to the floor show.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What you were talking about, before.
Peoples’ needs… Wyatt turns to Jonathan with a grin:</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Some other time.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: At the corner, please. The Rhiga Royal.
Listen, I have to meet someone..</p>
<p>****: Oh… okay. The cab pulls up before the RHIGA ROYAL HOTEL.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Hey. You had a good time tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah. Yeah I did. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I’m glad. Listen, that thing with the hooker,
I’m really sorry if I -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Forget it. It was funny. Wyatt smiles
warmly, pats Jonathan’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I’ll give you a call tomorrow. Wyatt climbs
out. Jonathan watches through the cab window as Wyatt disappears into
the golden glow of the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Driving in the cab, Jonathan catches his
reflection in the glass. He smiles, liking how he looks in Wyatt’s suit.
Outside, rainy Manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey. Could you let me out at the next
corner over there, on 7th Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Beside him we see he’s set up his
laptop, phone charger, pencils and a fresh, unopened pack of pastel
post-its.</p>
<p><strong>clancey controller</strong>: Any problems, you’ll want to see
Julie Levinson, she’s our assistant controller - or if she’s busy, Scott
Werner, our senior accountant. If Werner’s unavailable, we have two
staff accountants - but like I said, I don’t anticipate any problems. I
mean we’ve never had any before, so…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Right.I just need the access codes for the
accounts and sub-accounts? The Controller suddenly looks uneasy.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You’ve got account numbers, but no access
codes. Without those I can’t get the banks to authorize statement
verification. Besides, how else can I steal the money?</p>
<p><strong>clancey controller</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Nothing, I was just pulling your– leg. I
do need those codes though, when you get a chance.</p>
<p><strong>close on a business card</strong>: a Rutherford Stern
masthead, beneath it Wyatt’s name and office number. Jonathan picks up
his cell phone and dials it. RING… RING -</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Hey, Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How’d you know it was-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You really ought to block your caller ID. So
- same place as yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I wonder what the Founding Fathers would make
of this scene. Wyatt regards face after face of young men and women
wearing expensive suits, wolfing down lunch so they can get back to work
- a good 2/3 of them talking on cell phones as they eat.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m just glad to be outside. I’ve got to
tell you, this has been great, meeting up for lunch. I used to just- A
cell phone RINGS. They both instinctively reach in their jackets, take
out their identical phones. It’s Wyatt’s that’s ringing. Jonathan rests
his down on the ledge.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Yes?… Shit. Okay, see if you can.gettme on
the 6:15 out of JFK tonight… Fine. Wyatt rests his phone on the ledge
next to Jonathan’s.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Rutherford needs me to join him asap in
London to paper some financing with Lloyds. I tell you about this?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No - no you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Yeah, I should be gone a few weeks. Jonathan
tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Nah, it’ll be boring as sin.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wyatt studies him a moment, grabs his
cell phone and rises from the ledge.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Shit, I’d better get back. You ready?</p>
<p><strong>entered-is-not-valid-please-try-your-</strong>: He enters the
numbers again, receives the same prerecorded message. He hangs up – when
it abruptly RINGS, surprising him. He stares at the phone a curious
beat, then answers it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Jonathan Mess- CLICK. Dead air. More
puzzled, Jonathan frowns a beat - then replaces the battery with one
fresh off the charger.</p>
<p><strong>secretary 1</strong>: .That’s just it. You caught him in a
lie, so now everything he says you have to- RING of a cell phone. RING…
RING… It’s Jonathan’s. Surprised, he takes out the phone, presses
talk.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello? A soft, electronic rustle from the
other end… then:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Are you free tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I asked if you’re free tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m sorry, I think you have the wrong–</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CLICK. The line goes dead.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello? The CRACKLE OF STATIC on the other
end. Then:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Are you free tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually I am, but I don’t think I’m who
The static on the other end worsens.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t get that?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I said I am free, but I -</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Could you be at the Plaza in one
hour?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The hotel? I - I guess, but -</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Beneath the Eloise portrait. THE ROAR
OF A TRAIN pulling in. Only when the train passes can he hear the other
end. But now there’s no one there. Jonathan stares at his cell phone -
and frowns. Close on the phone’s display as Jonathan scrolls down its
list of stored numbers. His expression says none are familiar. And NOW
he gets it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hi, it’s Jonathan, I’ve got your cell! I
guess you must have mine. I imagine you’re in the air now, but call when
you get this. if you do. Oh, and you got a call from someone who
I’m…forget it, just call me. Jonathan hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: So where ya visiting from?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You’re from out of town, right?</p>
<p>****: Me? No.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Huh. I can usually tell. You seem like a
tourist.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’ve lived here all my life!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: No offence, pal. The cabbie pulls over on
Central Park South. Jonathan leans forward, peers up at the gorgeous
French Renaissance facade.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Well, here ya are. The Plaza.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - short time later</strong>: Jonathan is standing
awkwardly beneath the Eloise portrait, glancing at his watch, growing
restless, unsure –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Pardon me, but may I ask you
something - personal? Jonathan quickly looks.up, to find standing before
him an attractive BLONDE WOMAN. She’s. around his age, slender to the
point of stark, dressed in a chic grey business suit.</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: Are you waiting for me?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I - think so, yes. You’re here for Wyatt,
right?</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: Excuse me? I’m sorry, did we speak
earlier?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes. Yes we did -</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: Good. Let’s go then.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Look, I don’t think I’m – I mean; you and
I., we don’t know each other…? She turns to him, the slightest smile on
her thin lips.</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: No fooling. DING. The doors open. She
steps out. A beat. He follows.</p>
<p><strong>the hallway</strong>: Walls, carpeting - details all
classically gorgeous. The Blonde keeps a quick pace, headed toward a
room.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What I mean to say is, I’m fairly certain
there’s been some kind of mistake.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She stops dead in her tracks, her back
to him.</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: You’re not who I spoke with on the
phone?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No - I mean, yes, but -</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: You’re not attracted to me?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh no, it’s not that at all, it’s just
-</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: It’s just what… exactly? She turns,
steps toward him. Jonathan opens his mouth to explain – when she covers
it with hers. It takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss… but not too
long.</p>
<p><strong>the blonde</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: Jonathan lies post-coital. A smile. And then
a look of mild anxiety, ‘what’s going on’? He turns to the Blonde but
she’s fast asleep.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Sir, I’m showing that room as having</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well could you tell me the name of the
guest who was staying there?</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: I’m afraid we’re not allowed to disclose
information regarding our guests. If you give me her name, I can confirm
if she was registered here.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually, the thing is… it’s okay. Forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: Hey, you’re up early!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hi! How’s London?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: Raining. So you’ve got mine-and
I’ve.got yours?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah. Listen, last night…um…I met
this-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: Damn! Sorry, I’m gonna have to call
you back, they want me in a meeting. Hey, no long distance calls, okay!
Wyatt hangs up. Jonathan shakes his head, amused. He hails a cab,
glances back at the hotel. His lips curl into a vaguely proud, if still
dazed, smile.</p>
<p><strong>insert - extreme close on the cell phone’s display
window</strong>: The numbers stored have no names associated with them.
It’s just a series of undesignated seven-digit sequences, a list of
phone numbers that seems to go on and on. Jonathan clicks on a number at
random. It highlights itself. Jonathan hesitates, then clicks again. The
number is dialled. RING…RING - a woman with an elegant BRITISH ACCENT
answers:</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello, um - I’m sorry to bother you -</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: How did you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Through a friend.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: I think you’ve got the wrong number.
Now</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: wait - Jonathan fumbles for what else to
say before she hangs up.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Yes? CLOSE ON JONATHAN. What to say?
And then:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Are you free tonight? He shuts his eyes,
ready for a hang up. A long silence.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: I can be. Jonathan opens his eyes
half in disbelief.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Where. Right… The Plaza?</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: I’m afraid that’s a bit uptown for
me. Perhaps the Mercer? Say by the Shakespeare, half past eleven?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: It should be fairly evident.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Excuse me, um - I’m sorry to disturb you -
She turns, regards him a moment, curiously - a copy of Shakespeare’s “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” in her hand.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m - supposed to meet someone here
and-</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: You’re rather new to this, aren’t
you? Jonathan falters. She smiles.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: That’s okay. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>lobby elevator</strong>: She enters first, then Jonathan. He
waits for her.to push a button - only it seems she’s waiting for him to
do the same.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m sorry, what floor? She rolls her
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>back to the hotel lobby</strong>: Jonathan and British Accent
cross the lobby once more.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Frankly I’m surprised that whoever
gave you access didn’t explain more.</p>
<p>****: Right then, the rules: One,.no names, no jobs - no nothing.
Two, latex is mandatory the only rule that’s even remotely malleable
provided there’s mutual consent, although I say if that’s your thing,
take it elsewhere. And finally… She halts a few feet from the
registration desk.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: The initiator is responsible for the
room.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh - so I should…?</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>back in the elevator</strong>: Jonathan is holding a key
card. British Accent is leaning against the opposite wall, eyeing him
with a slight grin. A moment. DING. The elevator doors open.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So are there a lot of - people - who do
this? She turns to him with a look of growing impatience – when the
CREAK OF A CART causes them to glance up: a ROOM SERVICE WAITER is
crossing past the far end of the hall. Jonathan turns back to find her
staring at him uneasily.</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: How did you get into this?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well, a friend of mine -</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: He uploaded your numbers but failed
to explain the basics?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He’s - well, he was going out of town. I’m
doing something wrong, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: It’s not that, it’s just… well, you
strike me as something of a stowaway. In fact if I were more suspicious,
I’d say you didn’t belong here at all. Flustered, Jonathan’s about to
offer some explanation —</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: But obviously somebody felt you did.
The notion suddenly registers with Jonathan – Wyatt!</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: And I’m a sucker for bashful boys…
She takes his wrist, traces a finger over his palm… and removes the key
card from his hand.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Can I ask you something? Why do you do
this?</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Why are any of us doing this? For
the economics of the arrangement. It’s intimacy without intricacy.
Jonathan’s about to reply –</p>
<p><strong>british accent</strong>: Look, I’ve got a 7 a.m. breakfast,
so… She says no more. Jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well - good night.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She doesn’t reply.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey, I never heard back from you. I guess
you’re busy.with stuff over there. I’ve been kinda busy too! I’ve been
wondering - did you mean for me to take your phone?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’ve got a feeling you did. You dog! I can
see you grinning right now. Jonathan returns the BELL STAFF’s chipper
greetings and steps inside –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Anyway, I just wanted to say… thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>soundtrack music swelling</strong>: to herald a MONTAGE:</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Can you hold these?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: to Jonathan and YET ANOTHER WOMAN having
sex. The bed keeps banging against the night stand - a glass of water,
moving closer to the edge with every bang. There’s something almost rote
about it, a numbness in the repetition… the glass FALLS, HITS the ground
and BREAKS.</p>
<p><strong>match cut to</strong>: Jonathan PLUNGES into water.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Jonathan, for so long I don’t see you!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: J’ai ete tres occupe. with work. He’s
exhausted. And no longer so exhilarated by his nightly activities.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Work? No, no. You believe you can trick me,
Mr. Mischief Maker! I want to meet this lady friend of yours. Jonathan
is about to protest -</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Ah., ah - ecoutez, I have beautiful winter-
roses, just. arrived. She.will swoon… Jonathan smiles, but there’s a
reticence to it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe later, okay?</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: There is no later when it comes to love! If
you find it, you must not let it go.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan nods absently, continues up the
steps - when she tugs his sleeve. He turns to her; she searches his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: There really is no one? Jonathan evasively
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: There should be, Jonathan. It is not good
for a young man to be too much alone. He gives her an uncomfortable
smile. She smiles back, but as she heads inside, she looks both-sad and
worried for him. Jonathan continues up the steps, opens the front door
and disappears inside. We remain on the vacant street, hear his
FOOTSTEPS climbing the steps - and then the muted RING of his cell
phone. A beat, then another… .and the front door opens again as Jonathan
steps back out into the night.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Excuse me… It’s her. -It’s “S”.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan is about to say something but
can’t. She undoes the next button. We can glimpse a bra. She undoes the
next –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Before we…um, the thing is - I know you.
She glances up, curious - her hand lingering by the front clasp of her
bra.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not ‘know’ exactly, but we sort of met
before. In the Times Square subway station. It was raining…</p>
<p>****: In the subway?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You had no umbrella. You were soaked.</p>
<p><strong>„c,.</strong>: It’s true, I don’t have an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Then you asked me if the N train stops at
Canal. She squints back at him, vaguely recalling him. She smiles warmly
and continues to unbutton her blouse.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>„s»</strong>: Is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This just seems strange, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>s�</strong>: Because you’ve seen me before?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe. I don’t know, it’s just -</p>
<p>****: Ever since that night on the train, I’ve thought about how nice
it would be to see you again. And now suddenly, here you are, taking off
your clothes. „ S of Bingo! So what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It’s just that-</p>
<p><strong>“s,1</strong>: Hmm, it is kind of a gear-shift. She starts to
button her blouse back up.</p>
<p><strong>„s„</strong>: Well, maybe some other time. Jonathan is thrown
as she reaches for her coat -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wait - don’t go. She glances back
curiously.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What I mean is, by any chance… are you
hungry?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: sorry, I’m a messy eater. „s„ Me too.
Jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin, misses. she takes the napkin,
dabs it in water and cleans him up.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They continue to eat for a while, eyeing
each other between bites.</p>
<p>****: Um, I think there’s a little piece of… „Sr. .onion in my hair?
She laughs and flicks it.off. Hmm…they get everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: By the way, my name’s-</p>
<p><strong>„s,.</strong>: Don’t! She puts her finger to his lips. A
first touch. An electricity between them.</p>
<p><strong>„c/,</strong>: You know the rules. No names.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The ‘rules’ seem to specify no
conversation either. as., They are a little rigid, aren’t they? But I
think we should obey the ‘no names’. It’ll be fun!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ah, but I know.yours begins with an ‘S’.
„Sir Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I saw part of the monogram on your
briefcase. ./ S If I see-Excellent work, Holmes. Maybe I’ll tell you
if.you guess… Her face is an inch from his, the moment mysterious and
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hmrn…what do we know of her? She sports a
camel coat, a briefcase and possesses no umbrella. I deduce…her name is
‘Sybil’. ‘S’ laughs.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sarah? Sara? Samantha? Sandra? Susan? She
makes a little sound of encouragement. Hun…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Aha! Sue? Suzie with a ‘z’? You’re saying
my name is ‘Suzie’?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: is it?</p>
<p><strong>„s•„</strong>: Nape. Jonathan laughs.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’ve got to tell you, I’m much better with
numbers… How about Sonia? Sheena? Wait - Sophie! You’re definitely a
Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>„s.</strong>: With an ‘ie’ or a ‘y’?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Either.</p>
<p><strong>w7</strong>: Neither.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How about Syd? As in Syd Charisse? She was
Cyd with a ‘C’!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But maybe you spell it with an ‘S’? ,, S .
If I do not.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Steffi? Sexy Steffi soaking in the:rain?.
She mock-frowns.</p>
<p><strong>„s.,,</strong>: Nein.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sally? Sally with three ’l’s? She shakes
her head, amused. Jonathan rubs his chin.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hmmm. Hmmm. The mysterious ‘S’ alighted
from the train at Canal Street. She may well be from ‘downtown’…hmm…ah!
Of course! How foolish I’ve been; Sinead. ‘S’ giggles, charmed by
him.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Stella? Sky? Sunbeam?</p>
<p><strong>»s.,,</strong>: Do I look like a ‘Sunbeam’?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Absolutely. To me you are ‘Sunbeam’.</p>
<p><strong>„s.,,</strong>: Then so be it. Jonathan considers this a
moment, and concedes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Can I ask what you do for a living? You
first.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I sit behind glass and watch people pass
like fish. She smiles - a more interesting answer than she expected.</p>
<p><strong>alsip</strong>: You work in a bank?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Nahh, I’m… I’m kind of an accountant. us,,
Now I bet that’s just what you wanted to do when you were a kid!</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh yeah. I’m living the dream. Feel free
to leave now. u S „ Still here.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So what about you?</p>
<p><strong>„s»</strong>: No, we’re still on you, Frank. Off Jonathan’s
look, ‘Frank’?</p>
<p><strong>„s.11</strong>: You look like a Frank. So, Frank, when you
were a little boy, what did you wanna be when you grew up? .Jonathan
thinks. Confesses:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: A pro tennis player.</p>
<p><strong>„s,.</strong>: Huh! I wanted to be an umpire.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You’re kidding? „s„ Really! I loved the
idea of sitting in that big, high chair. ‘The ball was good,’Mr
McEnroe.’</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can see it. An 80’s new wave love song
comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it
up.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: a, S 11 I used to love this song. “S”
stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her hand out to
Jonathan. He smiles, shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Trust me, it’s not a pretty sight.</p>
<p><strong>“s:,</strong>: I’ll be the judge of that. He hesitates, then
takes her hand, rises to his feet, and starts to dance with her. He’s
self-conscious at first, but she’s agile enough to guide him, and soon
he’s into it. is S Il See? You just need the right partner. She closes
her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance together. He’s falling even
harder for her. As the song ends she holds his gaze – when a small yawn
escapes her. She covers her mouth. of S+„ I’m so sorry. Suddenly I’m
crashing. She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They lie
back, side by side.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’d like to see you again. Not in a hotel.
it S+ ” Hmm. I’d have to think about that.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How about tomorrow? /. S to It is
tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes
her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The perfect line of
her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The tiny pierced comma in a
presently unadorned earlobe. And then he notices, in the far corner: her
purse. He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20 feet
away. He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under
her – when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: to the purse, then back at “S,” sleeping
peacefully on his arm… and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any
more.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s pov</strong>: her purse is no longer on the chair.
He raises his head, sees that she’s gone. He stares at her pillow. The
indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself. He gets out of bed and
heads for the bathroom. There’s a NOTE on the desk on hotel note paper:
Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will call u later. Sunbeam xxx He
stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings. Jonathan picks
it up.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Are you free tonight? A bea- - and then
Wyatt’s familiar laughter.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey! Are you back in town?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I wish. It’s friggin’ anarchy in the U.K..
I’m stuck here at least another week.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night
- at the Hudson.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you’ve been
enjoying my little gift.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I
met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: That’s fantastic! Who is the lucky gal?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: She’s a member of your naughty little sex
club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God
conversation.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: That’s extremely naughty of you! So what
happened, Romeo?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’d like to say it’s a long story but it’s
not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: So she’s, what, a lawyer or something?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I-have no idea, I don’t know all that much
about her. All I know is I can’t wait to see her again.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Listen, I don’t want to dampen your spirits,
but - be careful, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Nothing. I’m just saying, this club - who
knows who anybody is, right?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah but - sometimes you just
have to go with what you feel, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: True enough. Hold on a sec. Muffled sounds of
Wyatt talking to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: It’s non stop back-to-back bullshit here.
Listen, I’ll call you later. And hey - congratulations! Wyatt hangs up.
Jonathan smiles. And then reads the note again - grinning.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Are you free tonight?</p>
<p>****: I think you have the wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello? Intermittent static on the other
end. And then what sounds like a WOMAN GASPING; it’s unclear if it’s a
sound of pleasure or pain.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: .Hello? The Gasping comes faster; Jonathan
debates hanging up - when the gasps halt,–replaced by the faintest
whisp_<em>of</em> a female voice: “No… No please…” There’s no mistaking
the tone now it’s fear - then. suddenly a shrill, terrified SCREAM… -
and the line goes dead. Jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his
hand, like he’s just witnessed something awful. He quickly checks the
display: “Number Unavailable.” Jonathan looks panicked with the
possibility that it was “S”- - when the phone rings again. He hesitates,
then picks up.</p>
<p>****: Are you free tonight? Jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her
voice.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sure you don’t mean “clashing?”</p>
<p><strong>,/s„</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan.</strong>: I guess. I got a call-before yours - I’m
not sure if it was real, or if it was even meant for me - but there was
a woman who sounded like she was being - I don’t know, hurt. Maybe
worse. “S” seems instantly on edge. Something about this scares her. If
SIP You don’t know who she was?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It could’ve been a prank. . Now you’re the
one who looks scared.</p>
<p><strong>..s„</strong>: No, it’s just - it sounds creepy, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She shakes it off, mustering a smile as
she takes his arm.</p>
<p><strong>„s„</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>«s”</strong>: He’s so cute! What’s his name?</p>
<p>****: Duck On Bike. “S” beams like it’s the greatest name ever.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You gotta respect him; he just keeps at
it. A WAITER arrives and sets down a laminated menu - entirely in
Chinese. “S” points to the characters like an expert. J! $ Ft We’ll have
this… and this… oh, and let’s try one of these. Thank you. The Waiter
nods, walks off.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What did you order?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: „ S of I have absolutely no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How do you know we’ll like it?</p>
<p><strong>s”</strong>: How do you know we won’t? Jonathan gazes at her
a beat.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This is so…not my life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: More than you know.</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: ” smiles. Jonathan looks at her.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ever since that night on the subway - I
haven’t stopped thinking about you. She lowers.her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t mean to freak you out. She
slowly looks up again, touched.</p>
<p><strong>„s„</strong>: Are you always so honest?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No. it S., Even so, I’m not sure I believe
you. Jonathan’s look, ‘why not?’</p>
<p><strong>“s.„</strong>: You’re in the sex club! Another anonymous guy
looking for anonymous action. I’m not judging you, I’m in. there too,
but don’t say you’ve been solemnly holding atorch for me for - how long
is it – wow, one whole month! Jonathan smiles.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Point taken. But I’ve thought about you a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>,.s.,,</strong>: In between the mindless shtupping?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And sometimes during. She laughs. The
waiter brings them their drinks.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So how come you got involved in the club?
She frowns slightly, thinks. „s . If Wouldn’t it be great if you could
just meet someone and not have to do the ‘work/ family/previous
relationships’ thing? Isn’t who we are right now so much more
interesting than where we’ve come from?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sure… but that didn’t really answer my
question. She reaches over and takes his hand, holds it tenderly. „ S of
I know it seems like I’m holding out on you, but I’m not. It’s just - I
turned thirty this year, and I made this vow to live only in the
present. And it’s good, you know? And yes, maybe it’s because there are
things in my past I don’t care to think about - but that’s the same for
everyone, isn’t it? He nods, still holding hands, loving every moment of
this. is S . „ I like you. I hope you like me. Can’t that be enough?
Jonathan smiles, completely disarmed by her. The waiter brings their
food and goes.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I wasn’t asking for an autobiography, you
know. I was just curious.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: If S. IS A woman I know used to do it.
So I decided to give it a try. For various reasons, it suits my present
situation.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You mean the intimacy without
intricacy.</p>
<p><strong>„s . 110</strong>: It has its merits. At least I thought it
did… until you came along. He beams, gazing at her. Blushing, she starts
in on the food. Outside we can hear rain starting to fall…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh - no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jis.11</strong>: Don’t let the wrapper intimidate you. I buy
it at a store nearby. It has ginseng in it, you know, for energy. It’s
not bad, though it sort of tastes like hairspray. She chews her gum. He
watches her; the jaw line, her lips. She looks at him and smiles, but
there’s something behind it: a sadness. Almost an uneasiness.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hey, are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>“s�</strong>: I don’t want to complicate your life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Too late. – I want all the complication
you’ve got. She gazes at him, blinks back her emotions. it Sc, Your
glasses. They’re fogging up. She reaches out and gently removes his
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She wipes the lenses, then peering into
his eyes, slowly leans in to return them to his face… only she presses
her lips to his instead, the glasses still in her hand, the kiss itself
at once tender and passionate. She absently lowers her hand, lost in the
unexpected intensity of the kiss. Embraced, they accidentally step under
the sheet of water falling off the awning. Jonathan guides her back
beneath the awning’s shelter. At S is Maybe you should go…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe you should stay. She smiles as he
kisses her even more passionately. Again they feel the awning’s drops,
and Jonathan moves to shelter them - - only “S” leans into him instead,
leading him out from under the awning, the falling rain suddenly
drenching their faces as they continue to kiss, the moment purely
exhilarating. wiping the rain from her face, Jonathan gazes at her,
soaked and utterly beautiful, with something akin to awe - like he’s
just breathed for the very first time. Rack focus on a hotel down the
street, its neon sign reads: “Hotel Lotus.”</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Perfect. They watch together. „s_.. So
were you any good?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yeah. But I didn’t want it enough. The
guys who make it really need it. I played recently, first time in years.
I’ve got this friend - a new friend, he’s great.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Maybe you’ll meet him one day. Anyway, we
played and he creamed me. But I knew I was better than him. He said I
had no killer instinct. I’s. it .I don’t know, I think you’re a pretty
determined character.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: On a level with this feller? He points to
‘Duck on bike’ watching over them like a charm.</p>
<p><strong>“s</strong>: Given the chance I believe you could be. She
idly flips channels, finds a romantic melodrama, an old black and white
film. They settle back to watch.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I know we said we wouldn’t rush. But for
the record, I’m doing everything Ican to apply.the brakes here. „S . of
Me too.</p>
<p>****: And for the record, I’d like nothing more than to make love
right now. But I’m kind of glad we decided to wait.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It’s a wise and mature choice we’ve
made.</p>
<p><strong>//s . ,/</strong>: Our parents would be proud. Pause.
Jonathan is wild with lust for her.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But say we did, just say… Mmhmm…?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Say we were to suddenly tear off these
robes… Would that be such a terrible thing? For two people in Manhattan
-</p>
<p><strong>„s.</strong>: In the small hours on a wet Winter’s night…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: To consummate their deep human needs in a
frenzy of…of… Fucking and sucking?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Beautifully put. Its. I. You were
saying?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Who - who would blame these two
people?</p>
<p><strong>0is „</strong>: Who could possibly judge them? They face each
other, breathing deeply, almost panting…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: And who would know? His face is inches
from hers - when she rolls over and reaches for a glass of water on the
night stand. She sips her water, as she turns back to Jonathan. Still,
Jonathan picks up on her subtle shift.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: is everything okay? She starts to say
something, then stops herself and nods instead. She sets down her glass,
starts to get out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>,i $„</strong>: For ice…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Ice, huh?</p>
<p><strong>i,s,i</strong>: I saw a machine down the hall. I’ll be right
back. She starts to tie her robe closed -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That’s all right, I’ll go. He hops off the
bed, grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar and a key card from the
table, he surreptitiously adjusts his penis : and goes to the door. He’s
about to turn the handle when -</p>
<p><strong>., s„</strong>: Wait -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes? She hesitates a cryptic beat - then
shakes her head, and smiles at him with immense tenderness. Jonathan
beams back. its . P1 Hurry, okay? He blows her a kiss, she blows one
back. Almost in SLOW MOTION. She looks stunning.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Would you like some help, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: I can manage, thank you. Finally, her
bucket is full and she goes on her way. .Jonathan quickly fills his
bucket with ice.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Returning down the empty hall, ice
bucket in one hand, key card in the other, Jonathan hurriedly checks
door numbers. We see Room 518 has the DO NOT DISTURB sign on. Jonathan
arrives back at room 517. He pauses and slips his robe from his
shoulder, mock ‘sexy’. He puts the card key in the lock, starts to open
the door– a small rectangular light blips RED. He tries the card again.
Again red. He knocks on the door, calls out:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can’t get the card to work. He tries the
card again. Leaning in, he thinks he hears something behind the door. He
peers down at the key panel: red. He knocks harder, waits for a
response. None. Dead silence.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?… Hello? He jostles the door handle:
it won’t budge. He’s getting anxious now, his breath quickening. He
tries the key card again: red. He pounds harder, then slams his shoulder
into the door. Nothing. Desperate, he tries the key card again – and the
light turns green. - A millisecond’s surprised hesitation - then he
jerks the handle, throws open the door and Jonathan tumbles into</p>
<p><strong>the room</strong>: He peers up into the small entryway:
empty. Ahead of him we glimpse the foot of the bed, its mussed blanket
and sheets. Jonathan gets to his feet, starts for the bed, his breath
quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket. Panicked,
he rushes forward to find BLOOD soaking the bed, splattered all over the
crumpled sheets… Jonathan gapes, horrified, the world crashing in on him
just as he senses something behind him and BANG! - something hits him to
the back of the head – he goes down like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>two hours later</strong>: THE ICE BUCKET on the floor. The
ice has melted, a pool of water seeps out… follow the flow to arrive at
Jonathan’s</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: fingers… slowly responding to the cold
water… The TV playing a different film now. OVERHEAD OF JONATHAN lies on
the floor. He groans a little. Rubs the back of his head. Checks his
hand for blood. Pain etched in his face, he manages to get to his feet,
shaky. He looks around the room. It’s EMPTY. No sign of “S.” He runs
into the bathroom. Also empty. Back in the room, he tries the closets:
empty. The CONNECTING DOOR between this room and the next: LOCKED. He
looks to where she’d draped her clothes and bag - every trace of her is
gone. He whips back to the bed - the sheets are still crumpled, only
there’s no blood an here on them. He runs to the window looks down at
the street. It’s four in the morning, no one around.</p>
<p><strong>the lobby</strong>: His undershirt tugged and misshapen,
boxers twisted around his bare thighs, robe open, Jonathan scans the
lobby, wild- eyed and shaking. It’s utterly vacant at this hour, the
only sound a piped-in muzak rendition of the Beatles’ “Yesterday.”</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Asian Clerk working there snaps his
head up with a startled gasp. Jonathan barely manages to breathe the
word:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: help…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: .I saw blood on the bed and then someone
hit me. When I came to, she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>security 1</strong>: This woman you were with. What’s her
name? Jonathan looks blank, his mind racing.</p>
<p><strong>security 2</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I don’t know. It starts with an ‘S’. I
think.</p>
<p><strong>security 2</strong>: Was shea prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No! No, she’s just a person. A friend.</p>
<p><strong>security 2</strong>: A friend with no name.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Of course she has a name! I just don’t -
we have to find her - something must have happened to her!</p>
<p><strong>security 1</strong>: I thought you said there was blood?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I told you, whoever did this must have
cleaned it up while I was out.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan freezes, eyes darting to the
night stand.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: My wallet and keys - they’re gone! They
were right here… He looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit
lies. His SCARF is gone too.</p>
<p><strong>security 2</strong>: Maybe she took them.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>security 2</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: She didn’t do this, okay?! Something
happened to her! You don’t understand, we were… Wait! He sees something
on the floor between the bed and night stand. He runs to to pick it up:
a Chinese Gum Wrapper.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This – this was hers… Jonathan clutches it
desperately, the lone trace of her existence. The Guards exchange a look
like he’s INSANE.</p>
<p><strong>security 1</strong>: Sir - are these your clothes? Jonathan
nods absently.</p>
<p><strong>security 1</strong>: How about putting them on.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer, I’m Detective Russo.</p>
<p>****: And you don’t know anything about her. Where she works? Where
she lives?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I told you how we met.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Through a sex group. Her flat words hang in
the air. He guiltily avoids her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Does this group have a name?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I don’t – it’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer, I spoke to the desk clerk. She
only recalled seeing you check in.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That’s… that’s the way it works.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: All right. But now you’re telling me that in
addition to this mystery woman, there was another individual in the
room?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not at first – look, I know how it sounds,
but I’m telling you, whoever hit me must have - I don’t know – taken
her. Maybe even… He stops himself, shuddering to think of the
implications.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer, have you had - experiences like
this before? Taking any sort of medication?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m not crazy, okay?! A woman vanished
back there! There was blood all over the goddamn bed! He becomes very
conscious that this sounds crazy - when A</p>
<p><strong>cell phone rings</strong>: it’s Russo’s. She pauses, struck
by the genuine desperation in Jonathan’s face. She finally picks up.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Yeah. No, I don’t think it’s necessary…
Right. She hangs up and turns to Jonathan. He looks away, barely able to
contain his devastation.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What am I supposed to do? An awkward
silence, then:</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: If you want to file a report regarding the
items she - - the items you claim were stolen… Jonathan shakes his head,
crushed and exasperated.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’d like to go now. Is that all right?
Can</p>
<p><strong>a spare bedroom</strong>: Used for storage, including an old,
gun-metal grey filing cabinet. Phone to his ear, Jonathan rapidly sifts
through faded file folders crammed with papers and documents.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: .Your ad says 24-Hour Locksmith… Well how
soon could you-… Fine. He opens a file: it’s where he keeps his
passport. He stuffs it in his back pocket, keeps searching, pulls a
folder marked “CREDIT CARDS.” Sorting through old statements, he finds
the line: “To report a card lost or stolen…”</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This is Jonathan Messer. I won’t be able
to come in today. I’m - pretty ill… ‘Duck on Bike’ sits on his
nightstand next to his glasses.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Next stop Canal Street. Canal is
next.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan pauses by a STREET VENDOR,
takes from his pocket the GUM WRAPPER he found in the hotel, shows it to
the vendor…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I was told you sell this gum here? The Old
Woman studies him a wary beat, then gestures to a candy display. In one
box is the same gum.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: A woman - a white woman - buys this brand
of gum. I need to find- The Old Woman interrupts him in raspy
Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m sorry, I don’t – Do you know the woman
I’m talking about? A white woman…? Please, it’s very important that I
–</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: My grandmother doesn’t speak English.
Jonathan spins around to find a CHINESE GIRL. in a smock.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Can you ask if she knows the name of the
white woman who buys this gum? The Girl questions the old woman in rapid
Chinese. She takes. a dragon her smoke, then gives a lengthy answer. The
girl nods, finally turns to an anxiously waiting Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: She says they sell that gum in practically
every store in Chinatown.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>detective russo</strong>: Mr. Messer?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: The body came in late last night, although
time of death’s still unclear. She was found in a taxi: driver was in a
.coffee shop on his break, came back to his cab and there she was in the
back seat. The elevator shudders to a metallic stop.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Her purse was recovered from a dumpster about
a block away, so we’ve got a name. Jonathan tenses as the elevator doors
BANG OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Simone Forester. Jonathan looks sick with
fear.</p>
<p><strong>same -“’moments later</strong>: The M.E. stands over agurney,
casually lifts the sheet that’s been draped over the body. We glimpse a
slender foot. CLOSE ON JONATHAN beside Russo. He turns instantly pale,
lip quivering as he stares in disbelief, our CAMERA SLOWLY COMING OVER
HIS SHOULDER to get a look at</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: THE VICTIM’S FACE: it’s not “S”. But we
do recognize her. It’s the Blonde: the first woman he’d been with, the
one he’d passed without a word in an office some days later. She looks
the same, only death-pale and naked - and her neck marred by a thin,
discolored line where she’s been strangled.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr Messer…? He tries to speak, but can hardly
breathe, let alone answer.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Was this the woman you were with last night?
She frowns, suspicious of Jonathan’s hesitation. His tense eyes whip
across the morgue: the two cops still idling there. They’re out of
earshot, but their mere presence amps tension. Angle on the guns in
their holsters. The handcuffs dangling –</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No - she’s not. Not last night… no. Russo
studies his strained expression a suspicious beat.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I figured it was a long shot. The only reason
I called you down is she was last seen with a man in the bar of the
Hudson hotel.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: You mentioned this group of yours meets up at
various hotels. I thought it was worth a shot. Russo glances up at him,
trying to read him - something about his reaction not sitting right with
her.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer, is there anything else you want
to tell me? Nervous and torn, Jonathan manages to shake his head.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt, it’s me. I need to talk to you.
Call me, OK? Please.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: May I help you? Jonathan is standing
across from her.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes, I need to get in contact with one of
your attorneys, Wyatt Bose - it’s extremely important. He’s working out
of the London office right now. If I could speak to his assistant or
someone who’d know how-to reach him immediately…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Of course. Just a minute. The
Receptionist types into her PHONE SYSTEM. She shakes her head,
confused.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: B-o-s-e. First name Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Wyatt with a ‘Y’?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes… The. receptionist frowns.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Oh – Ms. Pomerantz? Angle on a
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN walking past.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Ms. Pomerantz works in H.R..</p>
<p><strong>ms. pomerantz</strong>: What can I do for you, Mr,</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Messer. Jonathan Messer. I’m an auditor
from worth and Berman.</p>
<p><strong>pomerantz</strong>: Are you sure you have the right firm?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes – yes, I’m — He works here. I’ve
seen</p>
<p><strong>pomerantz</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: A few weeks ago. Wyatt Bose. Wait… here.
He hands her Wyatt’s business card with the Rutherford Stern masthead on
it. She studies it with a look of confusion.</p>
<p><strong>pomerantz</strong>: I don’t know what’s going on, but I can
assure you, there is nobody here named-</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’ve seen him in the halls - for Chrissake
we smoked pot in the conference room! Ms. Pomerantz abruptly frowns,
when Jonathan spots a LAWYER -</p>
<p><strong>flash insert -= coffee lounge</strong>: This Lawyer and
another laughing at Wyatt’s punch line. Jonathan runs over to the
Lawyer, grabs the man’s arm.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Thank God. Look, I’m trying to find
Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt Bose. I saw you talking with him,
cracking jokes in the coffee lounge.</p>
<p><strong>flash on same scene</strong>: Wyatt looks up, eyes meet
Jonathan’s. Jonathan smiles in greeting… but Wyatt just nods coolly.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: I crack jokes with a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hold on, you’re telling me you don’t–</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Hey - easy with the hands, okay? Jonathan
realizes he’s got the man’s sleeve in his fist. He lets go, spins back
to Ms. Pomerantz.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He said he was in London with
Mr. Rutherford, paperinga -</p>
<p><strong>ms. pomerantz</strong>: Mister Messer. Jonathan spins to find
Ms. Pomerantz scowling at him. A beat.</p>
<p><strong>ms. pomerantz</strong>: Mr. Rutherford is presently
recovering from hip surgery. In New Jersey. Jonathan glances around, to
find everyone - lawyers, assistants, mail clerks - all staring at
him.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt - .by a MAN in his early 60’s, his
WIFE behind him; both strike us as wealthy, downtown patron-of-the-arts
types.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Sorry, I – I need to speak to Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me - Wyatt?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt Bose. He lives here.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: In this building? He must be new. See, we’ve
been out of town the past2 months -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not in this building - in this
apartment.</p>
<p>****: Young man, we’ve owned this apartment going on thirty years
now.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But… I was right-here-with him… The Man
takes a step back, catching his wife’s equally wary expression, his hand
making for the chain lock.</p>
<p>****: Wait!! That painting there, it’s a Gerhard Richter, right?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: From a gallery! In Munich - the one that
Herr Kleiner handles? The art dealer downstairs?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Downstairs? You must mean Mr. Moretti, but he’s
in the carpet business -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: But Wyatt smoke to him.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Unless it was in Italian I doubt he got very
far. Jonathan steps back, looking like he’s losing his mind.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Young man… are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>“herr kleiner”</strong>: Sono spiacente.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Sir, we asked around, nobody knows the
guy</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: When I was working over here, you made a
photocopy of my I.D..’</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: We do all freelancers, it’s
policy.</p>
<p>****: Oh - I’m not sure I’m allowed to-</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You have to. She looks at him’, sees his
desperation.</p>
<p><strong>same - moments later</strong>: Jonathan is flipping through
the stack of photocopies, then halts on one. He stares at it. The
Receptionist peers over.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: That’s him? He was real cute. Only he
wasn’t a lawyer. He was a systems analyst, I think. He was here for a
few days to work on the computers.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist’s pov</strong>: of the photocopy in Jonathan’s
hand. It’s of a Massachusetts Driver’s License. Staring back up at us is
Wyatt’s smiling face.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I thought you said his name was Wyatt?
PAN TO THE NAME beside the photo: Sansky. WilliamR. Jonathan is already
running for the EXIT.</p>
<p><strong>on jonathan - moments later</strong>: Checking URLs site by
site. He finally pauses on one. It’s an article from the Boston Herald.
The headline: “POLICE HAVE FEW CLUES TO YOUNG EXECUTIVE’S
DISAPPEARANCE.” As Jonathan scans the article, we glimpse some lines of
text:</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: “…looking for William Roger Bansky, age
31…was employed on a freelance basis by an on-site software consulting
firm in Boston…” – .Bansky recently relocated from the .a young man on
the run…” Tilt up to Jonathan, scribbling on a Post-it pad:</p>
<p><strong>orig. from chicago – $$ trouble</strong>: He sticks the
post-it to the photocopy of Bansky’s ID. He steps back, stares at it a
beat - when he notices something on his desk,,resting under the phone: a
manila file folder. file up, opens it… to a series of 8X10 photographs?
Heart racing nervously, he takes one out: it’s of Jonathan standing in
the Plaza lobby by the Eloise portrait. Confused, he quickly flips to
the next one: in it, a Blonde now stands there with him – the Blonde
found murdered. Simone Forester. Jonathan’s rapidly breathing as he
shuffles through more photos. They’re in sequence, taken by telephoto
lens. Jonathan and Simone Forester getting in the elevator. Opening the
room door. Undressing. Screwing. In one, Jonathan has his hands on her
neck… He’s sweating with anxiety- when suddenly the phone rings,
startling him. He eyes it warily, then slowly picks up.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer, it’s Detective Russo returning
your call. Jonathan freezes, tries not to sound panicked, his eyes fixed
on the damning photos of himself and Simone Forester.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh - right, I was just - checking in, to
see if you had any leads…</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: On that missing girl of yours? No, not
yet.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh - okay, thanks-</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Are you sure you didn’t know Simone Forester?
The PHOTOS of Simone in his hands, Jonathan tenses…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I told you before -</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I remember what you said. And you weren’t at
the Hudson two nights ago?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I don’t – why are you-</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Turns out among credit card charges made that
night, there was one with your name. The card was declined.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I cancelled them all, the day they got
stolen.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I see. I figured it didn’t mean much - cards
move quickly. It just struck me, you know.. The coincidence. Jonathan
can hear the suspicion in her pause.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: By the way, the morgue confirmed
strangulation as cause of death. He found trace fibres of Kevlar in her
neck wound.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Kevlar?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: It’s used in certain kinds of rope and
string. Jonathan’s eyes suddenly go wide; whip pan with his gaze to the
hall closet door.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Mr. Messer?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes - yes, I’m –</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Thought I lost you for a second.</p>
<p>****: Well, I won’t keep you. You have a good night. Jonathan slowly
hangs up, his panicked gaze returning to the hall closet as he paces
toward it, throws open the door. In the far corner rests his racket bag.
He grabs it, yanks open the zipper… his face draining of all remaining
color as he peers into his empty racket ba . His racket is gone.</p>
<p><strong>same - moments later</strong>: Jonathan pacing the floor,
paranoid. He holds Detective Russo’s card. Knows he should call back. He
abruptly reaches for the phone, and dials… another number.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I know, okay? I know your name isn’t Wyatt
Bose. I know you killed that woman. And I know you’re trying to frame me
for it, so - so - WHY? What the hell is going on? And where is she?! If
you hurt her I swear to God I’ll… Jonathan falters, unsure where he’s
going with this and realizing he’s now talking to himself.</p>
<p><strong>to-send-this-message–press-pound-or-</strong>:
simply-hang-up. To-erase-and-record-a-new- messa ge—press-Star. Jonathan
hesitates, hits the Star key. A new BEEP. Harder:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It’s me. I need to talk to you. He hits
pound. Breathes. At least he’s done something. Suddenly from O.S. a
faint creak. Jonathan spins, scans the room, grabs the nearest blunt
object: his tennis trophy. QUICKLY CUT SHOTS of Jonathan searching his
apartment, his trophy raised as a makeshift weapon.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He finally halts, uneasy but satisfied
there’s no one else here - when his home phone rings, startling him.
RING… RING… RING… Jonathan hesitates. His machine picks up:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s answering machine</strong>: This is Jonathan.
Please leave a message. BEEEEP. A moment of hiss - then:</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Jonathan? Jonathan whips to the phone -
it sounds like Wyatt —</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Chet Peterson calling - – only it’s
not.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: I understand you were out today. I left
messages on your cell but never heard back, so I thought I’d try you at
home. He slowly lowers his trophy as he listens, staring out the window
at the dark night and empty street below.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Just want to make sure you’re up to speed
with Weiss Murphy, because the folks at Clute Nichols are expecting
you…</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: They’re our biggest client, so needless to
say, make them your top priority… Jonathan takes out the crinkled
Chinese gum wrapper. He stares at it with a look of longing: this is his
Priority-</p>
<p><strong>a woman’s voice</strong>: Are you free tonight?… Hello? He
hangs up, chilled. Turns again to the pillar, steps closer - no sound.
He hesitates… then turns and walks off.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: It’s “S.” Jonathan just gapes across the
divide of two subway tracks; he can’t believe he’s seeing her again… .
when she starts to back away, almost as if she might run. Confused,
Jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: wait! Wait, right there! Jonathan stands
on the edge reeling, desperate to get,to her. He looks around, hears the
distant: .nimble of afar. off train, and suddenly he does something we’d
have never thought him capable of: he jumps onto the tracks! He lands
hard, nearly breaking his ankle, but quickly scrambles to his feet,
splashing in the sludge between rails, eyes darting along the track,
anxious to avoid the third rail, ears attuned to the sound of that
distant train as he races for</p>
<p><strong>the center divider</strong>: He reaches the grimy rungs and
quickly climbs up. He gets to his feet on the center divider - now only
one lane of track separating him from the platform she was standing on -
only she’s no longer there? He scans the people waiting, no sign of “S”
among them - and then suddenly he spots her, heading for the exits.</p>
<p><strong>stop!</strong>: She glances back, utterly stunned to find
Jonathan standing on the center divider, feet soaked in muck. Neither
speaks for a moment, just staring at each other across the solitary
track. Then:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I thought you were dead! She looks like
she wants to say something, but doesn’t. And all at once he’s hit with a
crushing realization:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You are in on this, aren’t you?! She holds
his eyes a moment longer, fighting back emotion - then she abruptly
turns and starts back for the exit again.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How do you know him? Damn it answer me!
She halts, slowly looks back at him. of cam„ Through the club. He caught
me trying to steal his wallet. Jonathan looks confused; she’s struggling
to stay composed but looks like she could break down at any moment.</p>
<p><strong>„s„</strong>: He asked if I wanted to make some real money.
All I had to do was get involved with you, and not ask any questions.
Jonathan just stares, devastated.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So everything between us - was nothing?
She fights back tears.</p>
<p><strong>., s</strong>: No - no… After that first night I tried to
call it off, he said he’d kill me if I didn’t go through with it.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Go through with what?</p>
<p><strong>„c,.</strong>: The plan. Get you out of the hotel room, slip
out and meet up later for my money. Only I ran instead. He’s been
looking for me ever since. I have to leave the city -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Then why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>s�</strong>: Because I needed to see you again. I needed to
be sure you were all right. Despite his conflicting emotions, Jonathan
is moved by this. S,f I didn’t know how to find you - you were just a
number in a cell phone, and</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: ’is” Jonathan had taken that. I
remembered you took this train -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wait, Jonathan? I’m Jonathan. Jonathan
Messer. You’re -? O.S. we hear the approaching roar of an INCOMING
TRAIN… ii S 7f Did you go to the police?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can’t. He’s framing me for murder.
What?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He killed a woman from the club, someone
I’d been with. “S” is shocked., instantly terrified. Clearly she had no
idea. I/ S$f Jonathan, you have to leave! Do you understand? You need to
get the hell out of here, he’s going to kill you! The roar of the
incoming train is growing LOUDER… Don’t you understand? He’s going to
kill - - when the INCOMING TRAIN completely drowns him out… and swipes
“S” out of Jonathan’s view. Jonathan struggles to peer through the train
windows but its passengers prevent him from getting a look at her. Just
then the TRAIN DOORS OPEN WITH THE NOISE of passengers getting on and
off. Panicked, Jonathan cranes his neck, trying to see her through the
windows.</p>
<p><strong>stop!</strong>: He boards the train; using it as a bridge, he
pushes through passengers, desperate for an open door to the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Shuttle to New York’s Grand Central
Station. Grand Central is next. He jumps off the train, in the direction
she’d been walking – only she’s nowhere in sight. Jonathan spins
frantically as the doors close and he hears the TRAIN START TO PULL
AWAY. He runs alongside the train - desperately searching for a glimpse
of her - no sign of her in any of the windows… .until the last car
passes - and there she is, standing at the rear observation window, her
hand pressed to the pane, her tearful expression bidding him a
heartbreaking goodbye. He stumbles to a devastated halt, eyes pleading
vainly as he watches her recede, framed by the rectangle of window,
directly beneath it the train’s steel. exterior labelled the shuttle
line’s circled black and white S.</p>
<p><strong>ticket agent</strong>: Let’s see - there’s one to New Haven,
leaving in… six minutes. If you need to go farther, you can transfer
from there. “S” peers anxiously around her, like someone hunted.</p>
<p><strong>#; sit</strong>: And that’s the very next train leaving?</p>
<p><strong>„s„</strong>: No thank you. RACK FOCUS on the man withdrawing
his handkerchief behind her, grinning coolly to himself: it’s-Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: RACK BACK TO “S” as her eyes blink open
in terror –</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s voice</strong>: Jonathan Messer— Jonathan hangs
up. Takes an angry breath. Presses redial.</p>
<p><strong>worth-and-berman-voice-mail-box-</strong>: He hangs up again.
But his face bears a blank, eerily driven expression. He hits redial
again as he opens the door to</p>
<p><strong>worth-and-berman-voice-</strong>: Jonathan hangs up and just
stares at the phone in his hand, on the verge of something like a
scream. He takes a breath. Presses redial once more. Only now it RINGS.
Jonathan freezes. RING… RING… RING… RING… RING – a CLICK of someone
picking up, then SILENCE and faint wisps of static.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello…? Not a word from the other end. We
barely make out BREATHING.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wyatt? Is that you? Jonathan takes a
tentative step forward, as if fearful that the least movement will cost
him this connection.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Say something damn it! From the receiver
we hear a well-exhaled breath. And then:</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: Yesterday… Reeling, Jonathan grips
the phone tighter to his ear.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: All my troubles seemed so far
away…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: Now it seems as though -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: - they’re here to stay, Oh I
believe</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?!</p>
<p><strong>wyatt’s voice</strong>: - in yester–</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m going to find you, you hear me? I’m-
CLICK. Dead air.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Hello?… Hello?! Jonathan SLAMS the phone
down, tension in his face joined by a new emotion, something closer to.
fury.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I’m going to find you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Mr. Messer? Jonathan is too lost in
thought to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He glances up… to find Russo standing
near the entryway - what’s she doing here? He has no choice but to meet
her.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I was gonna call, but I was in the area. Just
doing some follow-up. Jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Follow-up?</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: On that missing girl of yours. The.one whose
name began with. an “S.” Have any luck finding her? Jonathan absently
tightens his grasp on his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: No. No luck.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: I see. That’s too bad. she studies him a
cryptic beat, then smiles flatly.</p>
<p><strong>russo</strong>: Well, who knows, maybe she’ll turn up yet.
You have a good day, Mr. Messer. Jonathan nods tensely, then walks off,
feeling her watching him from the curb as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His cell phone. He grabs it. Presses a
key repeatedly - scanning - then hits SEND. Jonathan brings the phone to
his ear, listens for the other end; then:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Are you free tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Do you know Wyatt Bose?</p>
<p><strong>blue pashmina</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What about William Bansky? Does that name–
She darts.for the “Door Open” button, but he blocks her path.</p>
<p><strong>blue pashmina</strong>: I swear to God I’ll scream.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Please, I’m not trying to scare you, I
just – I’m looking for someone.and it’s very important that I find him.
she tries to push past him, again Jonathan blocks her.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He does this too - or he did. someone had
to give him the numbers. Someone let him in. If I can-’find who it was
that knew him, they might know where he’s – she suddenly kicks him in
the shin with a spiked heel. Jonathan grasps his leg - she presses the
button and is out the opening doors before he’s even looked up.</p>
<p><strong>sound advance</strong>: TENSE CLACKING of computer keys…</p>
<p><strong>tnt. the sherry-netherland - lobby - night</strong>: Jonathan
rises from a couch to greet YET ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN. He gets no more
than a few seconds into his question when she about-faces without a
word. Jonathan has a relentless look in his eye. Takes out his cell,
calls another number…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I need to ask you something, it’s
incredibly important…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He pauses to unfold his now scotch-taped
photocopy, shows it to her. She freezes, eyes fixed on the license
photo. Jonathan braces himself for her departure - when she stares back
up at him in scared but clear recognition.</p>
<p><strong>same scene - moments later</strong>: Seated on the edge of
the made bed, Black Business Suit shifts uncomfortably as she lights a
cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I was in Chicago on business, a
little over a year ago. I was out.to dinner with one of our Chicago
partners,.a man named Holloway. That’s how I met him. TIGHT ON JONATHAN
as we SMASH TO:</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: At first I assumed he was a
junior executive at their firm. But he wasn’t. That’s not to say he
didn’t work for Holloway, but clearly in a more intimate capacity…</p>
<p><strong>tnt. the michelangelo - room - night</strong>: Black Business
Suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I wasn’t shocked. Besides,
obviously I’m no prude. Even back then, I’d been doing - you know, this
thing – for a while.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I was simply curious. More so
when he apologized, explaining that he’d forgotten about another
engagement. Wyatt’s knuckles just barely stroke Black Business Suit’s
thigh as he rises to leave. They exchange a knowing glance…</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I was intrigued. He was
intelligent, informed about everything from law to art to politics. I’d
never met anyone so in command of his own charm. He said that he’d come
from nothing, that everything he learned, he learned from his tricks. He
claimed that Holloway was even grooming him for a position at his
company. She lights another cigarette with her old one.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: In a way, I felt for him. But I
also admired him. It sounds silly,. but he had a way of making me feel -
close to him, you know? This clearly hits home with Jonathan. He barely
nods.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: So I found myself telling him
things.. Personal things. And, next thing I knew -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You told him. About this. A beat, and she
nods, crushing out her other cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: He seemed fascinated by it.
Wanted to know all the details.</p>
<p>****: I suppose I’d had too much to drink. And I was distracted… I
was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: Only afterwards I discovered
two of my credit cards were missing. As was my cell phone. Of course I
couldn’t say anything to Holloway. And Jamie must have known I’d never
report it to the police.</p>
<p>****: So I just put the incident out of my mind. I all but forgot
about it, until one night, maybe two months ago -</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I almost didn’t recognize him.
But when I did, I suddenly felt very, very scared. She freezes –
obscured by one of the trees as Wyatt checks his watch, scans-the lobby
with a cool, piercing look.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: I left before he saw me. She
drags on her cigarette, looks off into space.</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: He must have used my cell phone
to get into the group. Anyway, that’s it. That’s all I know. She looks
around. At the room, the bed. She shudders, rises.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Wait - thank you. Have you ever run into
him again?</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: Getz? No. And I don’t ever want
to.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Getz?</p>
<p><strong>black business suit</strong>: That was his name. Jamie
Getz.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Jonathan, you’re home early - Only when he
looks up, she finds the young man in the overcoat isn’t Jonathan. It’s
Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Oh - je suis desole. My mistake. Wyatt
flashes her an icy smile, continues down the steps. Solange watches him
walk away, a puzzled look on her face.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: who’s James Getz?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: A guy I roomed with freshman year at
Princeton. on Jonathan’s monitor we see he’s on a web site for Princeton
University alumni. He types in: Getz, James. A beat - then: “No match.”
A long list of G names follows. Jonathan scrolls down the list, but
there’s no Getz.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Shit. Jonathan exhales, about to log off -
when a name among the H’s jumps out at him: Holloway. Reed. Jonathan
stares at it tensely - then clicks on the name. “Sort no contact
information available.” Jonathan thinks a moment - then tries a search
engine, types: “Holloway Reed” then decides to add the word “missing.”
An article appears. From the Chicago Tribune: “BODY OF MISSING
BUSINESSMAN FINALLY DISCOVERED.” A head-shot style photograph shows a
man in his early 40s whom we recognize from Black Business Suit’s story.
Beneath his photo, his name: “Reed Holloway.”</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan glances up at the Hotel
employee manning the desk.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Can I print this out?</p>
<p><strong>solange</strong>: Jonathan… He squeezes her hand as she’s
lifted into the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’</strong>: Is she going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>ems worker</strong>: Yeah, she’ll make it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The ambulance doors SLAM shut. A hand
grabs Jonathan’s arm. He spins - it’s a FIRE WORKER.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>fire worker</strong>: Lucky we were able to contain it
somewhat. Better get your valuables together.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: How did it start?</p>
<p><strong>fire worker</strong>: We’re not sure. Maybe a bad fuse.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He opens another at random - and
freezes: it’s a photo of Jonathan and “S” walking in Chinatown. He scans
through others, shots of them in the restaurant, entering the Hotel
Lotus… TIGHT ON JONATHAN, terrified by the horrific implication -</p>
<p><strong>fire worker</strong>: Mr. Messer? Jonathan gasps as he looks
up to find the Fire Worker in the doorway. He quickly shuts the
file.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Just - give me a minute.</p>
<p><strong>fire worker</strong>: That everything? Jonathan regards his
minimal possessions, realizes how little evidence there is of a life. A
wrenching sense of isolation.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I guess it is.</p>
<p><strong>fire worker</strong>: You got someone you can stay with?</p>
<p><strong>night clerk</strong>: It’s fifty for the night. Jonathan
fishes out his film cannister, and parts with what he discovers are his
last three $20s.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Unable to sleep, Jonathan has emptied
his briefcase contents onto the bed. He stares at one of Wyatt’s photos
of him and “S.” She’s smiling up at him. EXTREME CLOSE ON THE IMAGE OF
HER FACE. The smile, frozen in time, at once haunting and heartbreaking.
He gently sets the photo down beside the Chicago Tribune article he’d
printed on the unsolved murder of Reed Holloway . His eyes drift to the
article, and something suddenly occurs to him -</p>
<p><strong>flash on</strong>: THE PHOTOGRAPH IN “WYATT’S.BROWNSTONE” of
Wyatt with bleached hair styled in a loose spike – IN THE ARTICLE’S
PHOTO, Holloway sports an almost identical look.-His eyes move to the
date of the article: “May 17.”</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Jonathan on the phone, a business card in
hand.</p>
<p><strong>office on phone</strong>: Boston Police, how can I direct
your call? Jonathan reads off the card Detective Russo had given
him:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This is Detective Russo, NYPD, badge</p>
<p><strong>officer on phone</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You’ve got a case, a missing person named
William Bansky. I’m wondering if you can tell me the date he was last
seen?</p>
<p><strong>officer on phone</strong>: Hold a sec.</p>
<p>****: Bansky, William, last seen… May 17. Jonathan’s eyes return to
the Holloway article</p>
<p><strong>missing businessman finally discovered</strong>: , dated “May
17.”</p>
<p><strong>officer on phone</strong>: Anything else you-</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: That’s it, thanks. Jonathan quickly hangs
up, equally encouraged and chilled by the connection he’s made. TILT
DOWN to a post-it, on which he’s scribbled: “BOSE = BANSKY = HOLLOWAY.”
To this he adds: “= JAMES GETZ”</p>
<p><strong>same - teller’s window - moments later</strong>: Jonathan
slides his passport through the window’s metal tray, to the TELLER
working behind three inches of glass. The Teller examines the passport,
then slides it back.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: M’kay, if you’ll just swipe your ATM card.
She gestures to a small punch pad to Jonathan’s right.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Actually, my card was stolen.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Mmm’kay… do you see those two taupe colored
telephones over there? Just pick up either one and you’ll be connected
with our automated system.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The thing is, I already used your
automated system and…look, this passport’s all I have left, it’s the
only thing proves who I am and now I’m down to like my last ten dollars
here, so… Jonathan’s cool is cracking. The Teller wrinkles her brow.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Mm’kay, if you press “0” on either phone? A
customer service representative will -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Give me a goddamn break.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Sir, there’s no need for profanity.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Oh no? In the last few days I’ve seen a
woman I thought might be dead turn up alive and a woman I assumed was
alive turn up dead, both at the hands of a guy about whom everything I
know is apparently a lie. I’ve had my building set on fire, my neighbor
nearly killed, and my apartment ransacked. So please forgive my
language, but it’s been one fuck of a week. The stunned Teller stares
back at him slack-jawed.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Look, I know I’m just another face on this
side of the glass, I get that. But I’m begging you, as one human being
to another, please let me into your life just long enough to help me out
here. Please. The Teller stares back at him a beat - and nods. She
starts quickly typing into her monitor, finally looks up.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I’m showing that card as having been sent
out four days ago. It definitely went out. We even heeded the change of
address request.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Well, like I – wait, what request?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Apparently you informed the bank of an
address change? She swivels her monitor so he can see.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Mr. Jonathan Messer, 140 E. 91st Street
-</p>
<p><strong>as seen from the convex mirror of an atm machine</strong>: we
watch from an ANONYMOUS POV Jonathan racing out of the bank.</p>
<p><strong>the bedroom</strong>: A room as empty as the others - with
the exception of a small pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far
corner. Jonathan slowly nears…to find it’s a stack of mail. He picks up
an envelope – O.S. the CREAK of a door hinge. Jonathan whips around – no
one behind him. He steps out of the room to investigate. We remain alone
in the empty room an excruciating beat… .until Jonathan finally steps
back in, only slightly at ease. He returns to the stack of mail, picks
up an envelope. He reads: “Mr. Jonathan Messer 140 E. 91 St…” Eyes wide,
he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail - all addressed to him
at this address. Jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief, when
he finds at the bottom of the stack: another PHOTOGRAPH. It’s of “S”
standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the track from Jonathan.
And suddenly Jonathan is gripped with fear, unaware of a blurred,
nearing intruder…</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Long time no see.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan spins round, Wyatt’s standing
there with a gun. It’s pointing directly at Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I have some instructions. Follow them and I
might let her live.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: This should’ve been simpler. I frame you, you
panic…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Where is she?! A terrifying silence -
Jonathan erupts:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Goddamn it tell me what you did to–</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Press pause on the questions and listen. The
brokerage firm you’re auditing is Clute Nichols. As a standard part of
that audit you’re temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as
access codes required for transactions. At 11 p.m. tonight you’re going
to skim from those accounts a total of $200 million and transfer that
money to an account I’ve established overseas.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can’t - I have no idea how to even-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I know you don’t. But I do. Your passport.
Now, please. Jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him. Wyatt catches
it. And hands Jonathan an ENVELOPE.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: It’s all in there. 11 pm tonight. Their</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: It won’t work - they screen for stuff like
this. It’ll be discovered eventually.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I can live with eventually. I always
have.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: This account overseas - it’s in my name,
isn’t it? A moment of tense silence. Jonathan just stares back hard a
quiet beat; then:</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Why’d you pick me? Wyatt raises a brow,
vaguely amused the question.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You answered the ad, Jonathan. “Feeling all
alone out there? Have a great job, fine personality and good looks to
match, but no time to.meet that special someone? Help is just a phone
call away -”</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: The ad - in Money magazine…</p>
<p>****: Told you to block that Caller ID. Of course I had to scope out
a whole lot of losers before I hit the jackpot. After all, there only so
many Jonathan Messers out there.</p>
<p>****: If you screw with me, well - you saw what I did to that Blonde?
That’s kindness compared to what I’ll do to your little .girlfriend. You
won’t even recognize her when I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Why should I believe you? Everything you
told me was lies.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Not lies, Jonathan. Foreplay. And now… now
you’re fucked. He grins his ‘charming’ grin and starts for the door.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Remember: be smart. I’ll be watching you.
And… feel free to take a shower, looks like you could do with one. The
front door slams. Jonathan just stands there, staring shell-shocked at
the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Mr. Peterson, one of the audit managers
is here to see you. Jonathan Messer?</p>
<p>****: Really? Well - okay, bring him back. We follow the assistant
out the door, read the name stencilled on the glass “CHET PETERSON,
SENIOR MANAGER.”</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Jonathan, good to see you again!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: - reverse angle to find a YOUNG MAN
we’ve never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Actually, I was just looking for Fred
Whipple’s office?</p>
<p>****: Next door down. The Young Man ducks out, and now Peterson sees
his Assistant approaching, Jonathan a few paces behind her, adjusting
his glasses. Peterson reloads his greeting:</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Jonathan, good to see you again!</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: Well, I have to say, your resignation
comes as something of a surprise. Most of our auditors seem to like the
freedom the position affords.</p>
<p>****: You’ll stay on to finish up at Clute Nichols, of course? Track
around Peterson to see Jonathan seated across from him, lifting his head
to reply - and doing so revealing it’s</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>peterson</strong>: So do you have any plans?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Yes. I’m going to travel. I want to see the
world. Peterson nods benignly.</p>
<p><strong>a series of quick dissolves/ stop-motion
photography:</strong>: Jonathan sitting in the conference room of Clute
Nichols, lettered-boxed by the glass wall through which he watches
employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers. Throughout this, Jonathan’s
blank stare of harrowed tension never changes.</p>
<p><strong>enter designated account number:</strong>: Jonathan copies
the numbers in from the instructions. Waits.</p>
<p><strong>enter sender’s 8 digit access code. required to complete
transaction.</strong>: His eyes travel to a page atop a Clute Nichols
file. We can glimpse an 8 digit code circled in pencil. Jonathan stares
at the cursor.on the laptop screen, the icon blinking petulantly. He’s
about to type… And then he halts. His eyes drifting to HIS CELL PHONE,
resting in its charger. TIGHTER ON JONATHAN. His eyes fixed on the cell
phone, an idea forming in his mind – RING!! of the cell phone suddenly
jars us. RING… Jonathan hesitates, then picks up.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: What’s taking you?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan says nothing. We can hear Wyatt
getting tenser:</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I said what’s taking you?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I wondered if you were monitoring
this.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Don’t worry about what I’m doing. Just finish
the transaction. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not until I see her. The transfer’s
impossible without an access code. And there’s no way I’m entering it
until I’m sure that she’s safe. So you tell me. How do we do that? Wyatt
still remains unnervingly silent. We tighten on Jonathan, holding his
breath, any plan he’s concocting clearly hinging on this…</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You have a wireless connection? Jonathan lets
out a brief exhalation.</p>
<p><strong>same - moments later</strong>: Jonathan snaps his laptop lid
shut, packs it in his gym bag, in which we glimpse the photo he’s kept
with him of “S” smiling up at him. He then turns to his cell phone once
more. He picks it up, scrolls the menu, punches a number.</p>
<p><strong>awoman’s voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p>****: Are you free tonight? A sudden, jarring SOUND ADVANCE OF MUSIC
as we</p>
<p><strong>wyatt ’</strong>: May I ask you a personal question? Jonathan
spins around, stares frostily into Wyatt’s magnetic smile. With Wyatt’s
new look, they could be brothers. Except Wyatt looks clean and crisp,
Jonathan dishevelled and tense. Wyatt eyes the bag in Jonathan’s
hand.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: In one of the rooms. Safe. I got us a
table.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Two Macallan 25 year. Enjoy. The Waitress
leaves. Wyatt raises his glass.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: To friendship. Jonathan just stares back at
Wyatt.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Bansky’s dead, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: He was dead when I met him. Just like you.
The rest was a mere formality. Of course he didn’t have your bargaining
chip. Speaking of which…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not until I see her. She’s the only reason
I’m here and not at the police.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I told you, she’s in a room. Alive.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Give me the key then. Wyatt considers
this, then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the
table. Of course there’s nothing on the key card to indicate a room
number.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: As soon as you’re done, I’ll tell you the
room number.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Not good enough. Wyatt reaches for the key
card; as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You won’t let her live. You killed all the
others, you’ll have to kill us too.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Hey, I like you, okay? You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: You like me.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: I do, Jonathan. In my way. After all, you’re
my creation. I’m the one who gave you life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Don’t you get it? It was her, not you!
She’s the one. She gave me life! You can steal my identity, but not
what’s here.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He puts his hand on his heart. Wyatt is
startled by Jonathan’s passionate outburst.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m weeping big wet ones for you
both. Now, let’s get on with it.</p>
<p>****: I don’t have all night, Jonathan. Jonathan reluctantly nods his
assent. Wyatt lets go of the key card. Jonathan opens his bag…</p>
<p><strong>same - moments later</strong>: CLOSE ON JONATHAN’S LAPTOP
SCREEN as it defuzzes from sleep. The screen as it was, cursor blinking
by the request for an access code. Wyatt watches intensely as Jonathan
starts to type – then pauses, looking confused. Jonathan quickly reaches
around. to the back of his laptop, feels an empty jack - and suddenly
turns pale.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: My wireless modem - I must have left it in
the conference room. I can’t get back online. Wyatt glares at Jonathan,
seething.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: You stupid fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I can go back there and-</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: No. Get up.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: They don’t let you use your own computer.
Wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill, gives it to Jonathan.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: They will now. Jonathan takes the hundred,
and heads into</p>
<p><strong>insert wyatt’s pov</strong>: Jonathan explaining himself to
the clerk. Satisfied, Wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view
of the business center’s glass. Across the lobby, an attractive
AUBURN-HAIRED WOMAN in business attire glances over at him.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: You forgot your. own room number?</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I just checked in and it’s been a hectic
day. Look at me! The Employee looks uneasy - something about the
ill-concealed tension in Jonathan’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: You could just ask at the front desk. I’m
sure they can-</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: I really don’t have time, okay? Jonathan
presses the bill into the Employee’s palm, peers up at the clock again:
the big hand clicks over to 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>back to wyatt in the lobby</strong>: Still eyeing Jonathan.
He sees the Employee hesitate, then accept the money. Wyatt looks
relieved – when his view is abruptly blocked by the Auburn-Haired
Woman.</p>
<p><strong>auburn hair</strong>: Pardon me, but may I ask you something
- personal? Wyatt quickly looks up at her, momentarily confused.</p>
<p><strong>auburn hair</strong>: Are you waiting for me?</p>
<p><strong>back to jonathan in business center</strong>: The Employee
finishes swiping his card through a scanner.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Room 907.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: 907 - thanks.</p>
<p><strong>back to wyatt in the lobby</strong>: His view of Jonathan
still obscured by Auburn Hair.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: What the hell are you – And then he sees
Auburn Hair glance unsurely at the Eloise portrait, then at her cell
phone’s clock – and now realizes:</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Motherfucker! He jumps up, shoves Auburn Hair
aside - eyes darting to the Business Center to find Jonathan no longer
behind the glass, just his laptop resting on the counter where he’d been
standing.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: We’ve got alarms on two - wait, three
floors -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Fire, I know - I’ll be out in a minute.
The scared Cleaning Woman nods and hurries off as Jonathan quickly
slides the key in the slot. The light blinks green. He jerks the door
handle and throws open the door to find -</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: resting; it’s a dense, rectangular block
- only when Jonathan taps it, he realizes: it’s hollow. He immediately
seizes it, yanks it from the wall… And there she is, lying face down in
a lifeless heap: “S”. Panicked, Jonathan rushes to her, turns her over.
She looks semi-conscious, hands and mouth duct-taped. Jonathan hurriedly
removes the tape, gently shakes her, terrified by how lifeless she
appears - - when her eyes widen, focus on his face. Before he can say
anything, she throws her arms around his neck, presses her face to his
chest.</p>
<p><strong>„s.,</strong>: You’re alive. He’s struck by these words, and
nods, holding her face in his hands as he kisses her urgently and
gratefully.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What do you say we stick together from now
on?</p>
<p><strong>ja s”</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TIGHT ON WYATT. As yet unnoticed by
Jonathan, he remains halted on a stair, bodies squeezing past him.
TIGHTER ON HIS EYES. That predatory gleam. EVEN TIGHTER ON HIS GUN,
tucked carefully at his side. CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND “S” three stories
above, starting to descend – when Jonathan notices the hint of
disruption in the flow of bodies below. Immediately wary, he leans over
the railing, but can’t get a good look. He grips the railing, leans
further over… and his eyes find Wyatt’s staring right back up at him
–</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: He’s down there! I saw him -</p>
<p><strong>11 sip</strong>: Oh God -</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Up - we’ve got to go up! Clutching her
arm, Jonathan and “S” turn back up, against the flow of traffic. Stories
above, less and less people are evacuating. ANGLE ON WYATT as he presses
upward, his steely gaze even more rapacious. The crowd is thinning as
Jonathan and “S” race upward as well.</p>
<p><strong>insert jonathan’s pov</strong>: a shaky, dizzying blur as
they race higher and higher…</p>
<p><strong>insert wyatt’s pov</strong>: from below but gaining on them,
Jonathan and “S”. appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn of
the staircase… CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND “S”, desperately racing upwards…
CLOSE ON WYATT bounding the stairs, footsteps echoing, the staircase now
empty and quiet, save for the footfall of Jonathan and “S” - no more
than three floors above Wyatt now… Wyatt slows his pace, leans into the
railing, takes aim… CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND “S” still hurrying up - when a
shot rings out, a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell, the</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: bullet missing them by inches. “S”
screams, Jonathan tugs her with him - - when a second shot rings out,
the bullet punching a dent into the underside of the stairs just
overhead. ON WYATT, realizing he needs a cleaner shot, taking the stairs
even harder in pursuit, all merciless intensity.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Come on! She grabs his hand, and they
waste no time disappearing into the mass of bodies. They keep moving.
Shoulder to shoulder within the swell of partiers, they fit right in -
instantly anonymous - though not as smartly attired. BACK TO THE
STAIRWELL DOOR as Wyatt enters the party, scanning the dense crowd, all
senses alert.</p>
<p><strong>insert wyatt’s pov</strong>: just a mass of successful,
attractive, partying young men and women. There’s no way to pick
Jonathan and “S” out. Wyatt’s smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks
the periphery. WITHIN THE CROWD “S” clutches Jonathan’s hand, their
heads ducked low as they press forward… CLOSE ON WYATT, frustration
gnashing at him as he quickens his pace, the idiotic enthusiasm of the
crowd enraging him, sweat beading on his face – – when suddenly the
music stops. Wyatt frowns., eyes darting. CLOSE ON JONATHAN AND “S”
glancing around in confusion -</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, we need everyone to
evacuate the hotel. This way please.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The crowd noise resumes, as the throngs
begrudgingly start for the exits. ON JONATHAN AND “S,” doing their best
to stay concealed within the exiting crowd. Angle on Wyatt pushing his
way through the crush, shoving people aside, trying to find them - -
when he suddenly stops. He has an idea. He takes out his cell phone.
BACK TO JONATHAN AND “5” within the crowd - - when Jonathan’s cell phone
RINGS. CLOSE ON JONATHAN as his eyes widen in panic. RING… He quickly
fumbles for it, tries to turn it off - - but it’s too late… WHIP ACROSS
THE CROWD to Wyatt, grinning wider. He’s spotted them. In an instant he
is bee- lining through the packed suits. WIDE SHOT OF THE ROOFTOP as the
throngs are clearing out. Jonathan grabs “S” as they duck, racing across
the dark, rooftop, looking for a place to hide. They take cover behind a
large venting duct near the ledge - gasping to catch their breath…
Stepping back, “S’s” foot clinks against something: a stray iron railing
post. She reaches. down for it, starts to lift it - - when Wyatt’s hand
darts in and grasps the other end. She looks up in terror - when Wyatt
punches her violently, knocking her to the ground. Jonathan rushes to
her - only to be blocked by Wyatt, gripping the iron rod tight.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Nice try back there, Jonathan. Looks like you
picked up a thing or two from me. Jonathan tries to strike him - when
with a lightning quick movement Wyatt whips the iron rod through the
air, cracking Jonathan across the face.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Killer instinct, pall</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jonathan crumples, his glasses knocked
to the ground. CLOSE ON WYATT as he grips the iron rod like a tennis
racquet, steps into position - - and brings the rod down on Jonathan
with ruthless tennis strokes: Backhand! Bam! Forehand! Bam! Slice! Bam!
Jonathan can barely peer up, bloody and beaten. He hears Wyatt drop the
iron rod…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s pov</strong>: Wyatt’s blurry figure hovering above
suddenly swoops in on us - as Wyatt grabs Jonathan by the throat, hefts
him up and yanks him back to the roof’s concrete ledge. Jonathan fights
to struggle free - when Wyatt jams the gun under his chin. Jonathan
freezes.</p>
<p>****: They’ll… catch… you…</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Me? No - no, I’m just a face in the crowd.
I’m a tourist, just passing through.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan’s pov</strong>: Wyatt’s face presses closer, now
almost in focus as he presses Jonathan’s torso back over the ledge -</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: As for you, you had your fun… Wyatt presses
closer, crushing Jonathan’s back to the edge.</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: Now we’re going to go back down… INSERT
JONATHAN’S HAND reaching into Wyatt’s pocket, his fingers fumbling for
the cell phone .</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: We’re going to get that laptop… CLOSE ON
JONATHAN’S FINGERS blindly prodding - he has the phone now - his fingers
feel for the antenna…</p>
<p><strong>wyatt</strong>: And we’re going to finish this, once and for
- - when with all his strength Jonathan jams the cell phone up into
Wyatt’s eye, the antenna punching into the retina.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Wyatt’s grasp slips from Jonathan’s
collar as he stumbles back, cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his
gun toward Jonathan - - when with every ounce of strength Jonathan
charges, Wyatt’s shot missing him as Jonathan slams him into the ledge
wall, seizing the momentum to turn himself - - as Wyatt falls right over
the edge of the hotel rooftop…</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yours, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>01s.11</strong>: Thanks, Frank. She winds the toy up. They
watch it make it’s funny way down the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Can I ask you something personal? She
nods.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: What’s your name? “S” considers the
request, then smiles gently, leans in close and whispers the answer in
his ear. Jonathan gazes at her a moment - whatever her name is, it must
be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: So what now? She smiles up at him.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: Well… are you free tonight? On Jonathan:
treasuring these moments. He is truly free – perhaps for the first time
in his life.</p>
<p><strong>jonathan</strong>: Yes. I’m free. They gaze at each other. We
leave Jonathan and “S” to their privacy, pulling back as they continue
talking, continuing away until we’re</p>
<p><strong>through a window and inside the hotel itself</strong>: the
window itself now a frame, letter-boxing the scene, people passing like
fish in their tank… except for Jonathan and S, seated center-frame, two
small figures side by side, face to face, talking intimately as we.</p>
