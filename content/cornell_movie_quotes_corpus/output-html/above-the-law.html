<p><strong>warner bros. inc. � 1987</strong>: 4000 Warner Boulevard
WARNER BROS. INC. Burbank, California 91522 All Rights Reserved</p>
<p><strong>2 ext. jungle - day</strong>: Blowing through the roof of a
dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING
PITCH.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage
whips in the fierce downdraft as –</p>
<p><strong>3 “huey” gunship</strong>: with US Army markings becomes
discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out
of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun
positions around the LZ.</p>
<p><strong>4 ext. jungle - two armed americans - day</strong>: watch
from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in
their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually
marks a CIA “spook.”</p>
<p><strong>5 helicopter</strong>: touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS –
rough-looking, in their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical
bags – disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the ground
nimbly, as if they’ve done it many times before.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You ever see chemical interrogation before?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: These assholes are agency?</p>
<p><strong>8 nico’s pov</strong>: FOLLOWS the medical bag in the
cowboy’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’re all C.I.A. But these guys are from a page
that ain’t on the map.</p>
<p><strong>10 ext. jungle - late afternoon</strong>: Nico in the point,
leading Fox and the three CIT men down an unmarked, twisting trail. We
see from Nico’s gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at
home in the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>11 trail - late afternoon</strong>: snakes along a ridge
line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way
out in the boonies.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: How long till we’re across the border?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: We’ve been over for the past hour.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: What are you looking at, hotshot?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Why don’t you light a bonfire?</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Just drive the taxi, ace.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: They’re in there.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I don’t trust these yo-yo’s.</p>
<p><strong>15 full shot - base camp</strong>: We see Nico moving like a
shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter.
We can vaguely hear him ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in
dialect.</p>
<p><strong>16 defensive position - nico</strong>: hears a SOUND, looks
back toward the hooch.</p>
<p><strong>17 nico’s pov - hooch</strong>: Two Asian prisoners, stripped
to the waist, babbling in- coherently, are dragged out the back by a
pair of Cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can
be heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside gives the hut
a creepy, frightening aspect.</p>
<p><strong>18 back to nico</strong>: He’s extremely uneasy about what’s
about to happen inside the hooch.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. hooch - close on rickety card table - night</strong>:
on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials and
surgical instruments. Zagon’s hand picks up a hypodermic, squirt-tests
it.</p>
<p><strong>20 two asian prisoners</strong>: are on their knees,
shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon tape to a stake driven into the
ground in the center of the hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves
in, grabs the first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing. Zagon watches
with professional satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: That’s the nice thing about modern
technology. You don’t have to wait for results.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Where is it, Charley? You got six tons of our
shit –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Don’t you die on me, fucker –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: What the hell’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: This pussy can’t hold his liquor.</p>
<p><strong>23 nico</strong>: enters at this point. He takes in the scene
quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn’t look at
Nico, but it’s plain he is aware of Nico’s presence. It is as if he
wants to prove something to this muscular kid – and prove it to the
others, too.</p>
<p><strong>24 first prisoner</strong>: dies in agony on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>25 second prisoner</strong>: watches with eyes like flint. He
is in his mid-forties, scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a
colonel or higher, he looks like he’s been fighting these round-eyes
since the French in the 50’s. He is plainly one tough customer. The
second prisoner meets Zagon’s eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on
him, too. Zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred. The
prisoner doesn’t back down an inch.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: So my little doctor bag doesn’t scare you,
eh? Well I don’t need it to open your yap.</p>
<p><strong>26 nico</strong>: watches impassively.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Where’s our load, you sack of slime? What did
you do with my shit? –</p>
<p><strong>27 zagon</strong>: punches the prisoner full in the face,
holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and
to terrify him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner crashes
sideways, face bloody –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: I’m gonna teach you good. I’m gonna teach you
never to fuck with my opium –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: You’re a hard nigger, aren’t you, boy? You
took it from the Chinks… you took it from the French. You’ll be fucked
if some Yankee peckerwood’s gonna start your gums flapping –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: – Well, you’re gonna chirp for me, tough guy.
You’re gonna sing like a choir –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: What the fuck does this have to do with
military intelligence?</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Your orders are ‘assist and observe’ cherry
–</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Back off, partner –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: I’m gonna start carving at your ankles. We’ll
throw your feet in that box right over there. Then I’m gonna take off
your arms –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fox –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Shut up, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid
–</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Are you crazy?!! What the fuck’s the matter
with you?!!!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Nico!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I don’t cap him now, he’s gonna do me
later.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ll cover this. Get back to the</p>
<p><strong>l.z. –</strong>: – I’ll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa
here!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I’ll call for a chopper… get outa here!</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. nico’s house - back yard - day</strong>: Huge trays
of Italian delicacies are carried out into the sunlight by several “old
country”-type women. Wine is poured from generous carafes. Friends and
relatives are everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently
the party has come here straight from the church. Presents for the new
baby are being opened by Nico’s wife, Sara, and Nico’s mother, ROSA.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Mama, look at this – all done by hand.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Nico had one just like this. Thank you,
Cora.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I think we got a little problem here.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I carried him for the last nine months, you
take him for the next diaper.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s what you get for not marrying a
Sicilian.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: My brave husband. He’s not afraid of thieves
and muggers, but he’s terrified when his son poops in his pants.</p>
<p><strong>35 another part of back yard</strong>: Three Chicago cops,
LUKICH and HENDERSON in plain clothes and LIEUTENANT STROZAH in uniform
wolf some Italian goodies while eying the group of celebrating
relatives.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Toscani holds the record… for havin’ more
relatives under federal indictment than any other cop in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>36 two of nico’s uncles</strong>: BRANCA and LUIGI, who look
like they have been on the other side of a cop’s work, are in turn eying
Lukich and Henderson – plus a cluster of other cops in civvies hovering
around the buffet table like vultures.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Look at these stiff dicks. A free meal and
they come out like flies.</p>
<p><strong>38 back yard</strong>: Jackson enters. She’s impeccably
dressed and radiates intelligence. She’s greeted warmly by Lukich,
Henderson, Strozah, and a couple of other cops.</p>
<p><strong>strozah</strong>: I didn’t do nothing, Counselor. I’m
clean.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Eight more days, Lieutenant. You better
start preparing your defense.</p>
<p><strong>henderson</strong>: Baby, I’m gonna put you on retainer.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: You passed the bar? I make it a point never
to pass the bar.</p>
<p><strong>luigi</strong>: Now this cop. She can bust me any day.</p>
<p><strong>40 nick, sara and rosa</strong>: Jackson comes up, makes a
theatrical appreciation of Nico’s stylish attire, kisses Sara and greets
Nico’s mom warmly. She starts oohing and ahhing over the baby.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Look at this little bundle. What a
cupcake!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and
find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Nico, will you let the woman catch her
breath?</p>
<p><strong>43 japanese woman</strong>: moves in shyly on the fringe of
the cluster. While Jackson and Sara continue their “mom” talk, Nico
edges off toward Watanabe, shaking her hand with real pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Watanabe! Say hey, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>44 ext. toscani front porch - later</strong>: Branca, Luigi
and several other Toscani patriarchs smoke cigars and sip beer in a
cluster. Nico holds Julian.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: You’re a father now. Are you gonna take me
up on my offer?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’m happy, Branca. I like what I do.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as
the statue of David. And he’s a cop!</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: This face should be sticking up from a white
shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent
living for his family!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: We’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>luigi</strong>: Nickels and dimes. Your wife’s a woman with
class. What did she run – a ballet school…?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: An art gallery.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Same thing. She wants a husband who carries
a briefcase, not a shoulder holster.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You
wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You’ve had your fun. Basta!
Enough!</p>
<p><strong>uncle guiseppe</strong>: Let your family help you, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don’t need. I’d
rather get shot by someone I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>45 int. nico’s house - upstairs - day</strong>: Nico comes
out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder holster, tugging his jacket
over it. He sees his mother standing near the head of the stairs, just
outside another bedroom door. Concern on her face.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: What are you doing in here, Mama? Go join the
party…</p>
<p><strong>46 int. nursery - day</strong>: Sara and another woman sit on
the bed, comforting a 60-ish grandmother Zingaro, who is crying. Nico
comes in. He kneels before MRS. ZINGARO, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Mrs. Z. Is this a way to act on the day of my
son’s baptism?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: It’s Lucy. She’s gone again.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s that kid from the bar on Damen? The one
with the drugs?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening? I
have to go to work now. But I’ll come by tonight. You’ll be at the
bakery?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. zingaro</strong>: Si, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: We’ll talk, okay? We’ll find a way to take
care of this.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. nico’s house - day</strong>: Festivities still in
progress. Nico passes through, nodding, thanking people for coming,
taking farewells. Jackson waits for him, glancing at her watch.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. unmarked car - moving</strong>: Nico is driving.
Jackson checks in on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Unit Ten Tango X-ray. We’re up and
clear.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I promised the Lieutenant, I’m gonna take care
of you. Broken windows and lost kittens for your last week.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: And then you’re gonna come visit me in a
nice, clean, air conditioned office –</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. street - buckshot’s liquors - day</strong>: The
unmarked car pulls up outside a liquor store and bar.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. unmarked car</strong>: as it parks. Jackson gives
Nico a look: “What are we stopping at this dive for”?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.</p>
<p><strong>bad dude</strong>: Why the fuck don’t you assholes leave me
alone?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>first army jacket</strong>: I thought this was a kosher bar.
They didn’t allow no pork in here.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You seen this girl?</p>
<p><strong>second army jacket</strong>: I seen the top of her head.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s witty.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Come on. Show me something.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I get it. It’s a gay bar. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen
your mother’s – Or was it yours? Or yours? I couldn’t tell, it looked
like her ass –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Come on, motherfuckers. Do it. Do it! One man
–</p>
<p><strong>bad dude</strong>: Upstairs! She’s upstairs! 4-D!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You cocksuckers are brave enough with
14-year-old girls.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>reverse - nico’s pov</strong>: A young PIMP – quite handsome
in a boyish way – stares up in panic from a grimy mattress on the floor.
Little LUCY is in bra and panties, strung out, 14 and beautiful.
Syringes and free-base paraphernalia are on a table.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: This ain’t your day, kid.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: Wait, man. It ain’t like it looks –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s two years.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s four. She’ll get you eight more. And
I’m just warming up –</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: Take it, baby. It’s all yours –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Get your clothes on, Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: There’s money. Three grand in the mattress… …
I can get ya more –</p>
<p><strong>stud</strong>: Hey, sister, what it be?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t you fuckin’ move.</p>
<p><strong>59 top of landing</strong>: The Pimp is dazed, bloody. Nico
comes down with Lucy, hauls the Pimp to his feet –</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Let him alone! He’s beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Not when I get through with him.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: No, man, wait! I’ll give you something!
Something big!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Please, Nico! Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: It’s huge! I swear it! A shipment… coming in
next Tuesday –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Shipment, my ass.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: This is square! On my mother’s soul! You can’t
send me up –</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She’s
banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: What lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: I don’t know. That platinum chola… Carla
DeCarlo… she knows.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: She got popped this afternoon. She’s downtown.
Red dress, lizard shoes –</p>
<p><strong>60 ext. street outside bar - day</strong>: Jackson looks up
from the car to see Nico – wild-haired, shirt ripped and bloody –
emerging from the adjacent apartment stoop, leading young Lucy, who’s
tear-streaked, wearing a torn dressing gown. Instantly, Jackson is out
of the car, moving to Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: It’s okay, girl. Mama Jax is here.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That was some leak you took.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Broken windows and lost pussy cats,
huh.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You’re one crazy bastard, Toscani.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: We’ll get her some clothes and a bath. I’m not
bringing her home to her grandmother like this.</p>
<p><strong>61 omitted</strong>: &amp; 62</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I don’t get you, Toscani. What the hell are
you doing being a shitheel cop? With your background?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: When I was overseas, I saw some things. Things
that eat your guts out. Things that stay in front of your eyes like they
were burned in and branded.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You can walk away from them, Jax. You can
quit, but you know it’s still going on. You try something anyway – – I
know I’m not going to change the world. I can’t stop the tonnage coming
in, I can’t fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: But maybe here, huh? Maybe in my own city, my
own neighborhood, on my own block – maybe here I can do something.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s why I’m a shitheel cop.</p>
<p><strong>64a int. police station - day</strong>: Behind the desk, a
few detectives man the phones. A Latin attorney, ABANDANO, is at the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You can see your client. As soon as she’s
through eating her dinner.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. police lockup - “cage” and hallway -
evening</strong>: Hookers, female addicts, etc. in the downtown “cage.”
Nico has the girl in the red dress and lizard shoes out in the hallway
adjacent to the lock- up. Nico is Mr. Charm, offering her a heart-shaped
box of chocolates.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Carla… Carla – I just want the name of your
boyfriend –</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I got 200 boyfriends.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Why can’t you sons-a-bitches ever treat
someone with a little respect?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Take it easy, sister.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I ain’t your goddamn sister. We ain’t got
the same mother, motherfucka.</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. downtown - financial district - day</strong>:
Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building. She gets
into Nico’s car.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. car - day</strong>: Jackson checks her makeup in the
rearview mirror. Nico sits behind the wheel. The two are on some kind of
stakeout.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: The lawyer’s name is Abandano. He’s on the
third floor. I got a look at him. I couldn’t get how he’s connected, but
according to Carla, he’s a lousy lay.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Maybe we can bust him for that.</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. downtown building - day</strong>: A short,
slick-looking Latin man in a business suit emerges from the
building.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That’s our stud.</p>
<p><strong>69 ext. financial district - bank - day</strong>: ABANDANO
meets a striking-looking middle-aged woman in front of a stately
financial institution. They go in. Jackson remains out on the street,
while Nico follows the couple in.</p>
<p><strong>71 ext. federal building - day</strong>: Abandano and the
woman are crossing the plaza as Nico and Jackson run up the block. Near
the entrance to the Federal Building, a small but vocal group of
protestors are gathered, carrying signs and chanting slogans. The frus-
trated cabbie watches them in the background.</p>
<p><strong>72 plaza</strong>: Jackson and Nico watch Abandano and the
woman pass the crowd of demonstrators and enter the building. Jackson
acts indifferent, almost frustrated; Nico keenly senses something.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. expensive restaurant - day</strong>: The main dining
room. No customers, just busboys readying tables for the evening’s
business. We notice one of the busboys is the “pimp” Nico found with
Lucy.</p>
<p><strong>74 booth near back hallway</strong>: The owner’s table.
Stacks of dining checks, a cashbox and calculator, full ashtrays, wine
glasses. BAUTISTA SALVANO, a heavyset, swarthy Venezuelan dressed in a
tux with the collar open, glowers across the table at a mus- cular,
scar-faced Latin busboy – the kind who looks like he does more for his
boss than clean up the tables. The busboy is nervous, apologetic –</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: – I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo,
not your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>nardo</strong>: I’m sorry, boss.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Your English is getting good… You’re
showing it off. Showing it off on the street –</p>
<p><strong>nardo</strong>: I keep quiet. I never talk no more –</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Make yourself useful. Get downstairs, bring
me one of these. Then get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>nardo</strong>: I thought I was dead, man. I thought I was
fucking dead.</p>
<p><strong>chi chi</strong>: You were right, cabron.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Clean up this mess.</p>
<p><strong>chi chi</strong>: Who knows who else is talking –</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: He was a young fool.</p>
<p><strong>76 back in upstairs dining room</strong>: Salvano and Chi Chi
emerge from the basement steps and walk toward their booth.</p>
<p><strong>chi chi</strong>: We’re crazy waiting for this bullshit
‘shipment.’ Let me waste the other fucker now.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Be patient. This will be done the way it
was planned.</p>
<p><strong>77 ext. body and fender shop - night</strong>: Rusting
cyclone fences surround a mud-lot repair yard in a dingy industrial
section. Young Lation and black workers finish up for the night; through
the dirty, security-barred office window we can see Chi Chi talking on
the phone. The lawyer, Abandano, is also there.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Toscani, you’re going to have me doing
time.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Lighten up, Jax. No one’s bringing this into
court.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Except against us.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I don’t give a shit how we do it. I just wanna
get there.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I thought you said you were gonna protect
me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel –</p>
<p><strong>80 angle through office window</strong>: Chi Chi listens with
increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down
–</p>
<p><strong>81 back to nico</strong>: In unmarked car. He’s writing it
down too.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I got the shipment.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What? What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: ‘… Engine block has cleared customs. Serial
number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.’</p>
<p><strong>83 ext. street - night</strong>: Nico and Jackson’s car
follows at a discreet distance.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Unit Ten Tango X-ray. I need a vehicle
registration I.D.</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Go ahead, please.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: ’86 Lincoln. Illinois 354 Dog ’67.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. unmarked car - moving - night</strong>: Jackson picks
up Nico’s pad to take down the response. After a moment:</p>
<p><strong>police radio</strong>: Vehicle registration follows.
Leaseholder: Ramon Testamente, registered alien. Nation of origin:
Venezuela. Do you wish criminal record search?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I want to know when he wipes his behind.</p>
<p><strong>85 series of shots</strong>: As Nico and Jackson tail the
Lincoln out of the industrial zone into a fancier, non-Latin
neighborhood. On the sidewalks we glimpse theatergoers, fashionable
white couples out on the town.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. unmarked car - moving</strong>: Nico and Jackson
exchange a glance.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Salvano?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. restaurant - night</strong>: Chi Chi and Abandano get
out of their car, a valet takes it, Chi Chi enters the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>89 int. salvano’s restaurant - night</strong>: Nico and
Jackson enter the main dining room, which we recognize from the scene
with Nardo the busboy.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Two for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Two for drinks.</p>
<p><strong>90 nico’s pov - down bar</strong>: Looking past numerous
patrons, we see Chi Chi whisper something to a waiter and take a seat at
a rear table The waiter hurries off into a back hallway.</p>
<p><strong>91 nico and jackson - at bar</strong>: Jackson moves to the
salsa beat. A BARMAID approaches.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Gimme something stiff. I need it.</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: Who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>92 rear dining room</strong>: From the back hallway Salvano
emerges – in his tux, looking prosperous. He sits down beside Chi Chi
and Abandano. A waitress brings two drinks. After a few words, Chi Chi
removes the scrap of paper from his pocket, hands it to Salvano.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’ll have your engine block next Tuesday,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Why couldn’t it be a week from Tuesday? I
could read about it in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Cheer up, partner. I’m gonna make you
famous.</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. wholesale meat area - day</strong>: Track spurs,
greasy streets, parked fork lifts.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You missed a few spots, boys.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: I’m takin’ it home t’a make kilbasa,
boss.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: This ain’t a bust – it’s a convention.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t you like company, Luke? We got all the
scouts here – Drug Enforcement Agency, the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
–</p>
<p><strong>walkie-talkie</strong>: Keep this channel clear, Toscani.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: This is our channel, dickhead. And our
collar.</p>
<p><strong>another walkie-talkie</strong>: That’s enough, all of you!
Keep this channel clear.</p>
<p><strong>96 angle on meat plant - day</strong>: Nothing happening.</p>
<p><strong>97 another angle</strong>: Dead as hell.</p>
<p><strong>98 nico, lukich and jackson</strong>: Bored, pissed off,
tired. Suddenly:</p>
<p><strong>1st walkie-talkie</strong>: All right. Everyone get their
heads outa their ass.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: ‘… And so I quit the police department… got
myself a steady job –’</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: They spotted me. I’m too good- looking to be
a meat slopper.</p>
<p><strong>1st walkie-talkie</strong>: Will you hot dogs shut up?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’re too ugly.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Here we go, boys and girls – You stay put.</p>
<p><strong>102 int. plant</strong>: Nico and Lukich draw their guns,
running full-tilt.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s going down now. Move!</p>
<p><strong>103 ext. rear of packing plant - day</strong>: The station
wagon men heave their rear door open, the van men start to open their
side door. The Lincoln is stopped at a distance. Suddenly –</p>
<p><strong>104 nico and lukich</strong>: burst from the rear door of the
packing plant, guns drawn.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Police!</p>
<p><strong>105 quick cuts - van and station wagon men</strong>: grab for
their weapons –</p>
<p><strong>106 cops in meat truck and pickup</strong>: come highballing
around both sides of the packing plant –</p>
<p><strong>107 van and station wagon men</strong>: OPEN FIRE. There is
confusion and mayhem; it’s not clear who’s a cop and who’s a
criminal.</p>
<p><strong>108 nico and lukich</strong>: dive for cover, RETURNING FIRE.
The DEA men in one truck also OPEN UP. One of the van men is hit between
the eyes. MACHINE GUN FIRE rakes the DEA truck; it spins out of control;
flips. Lukich SHOOTS the machine-gunner.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Nico! The Lincoln!</p>
<p><strong>109 lincoln</strong>: starts to PEEL OUT. We glimpse Chi Chi
in the driver’s seat, Salvano on the passenger side.</p>
<p><strong>110 nico</strong>: steps in front of the accelerating
Lincoln, raises his .45.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. lincoln - day</strong>: Salvano and Chi Chi dive
below the dash and continue forward. Salvano, in the passenger seat,
raises his GUN; FIRES blindly – trying to hit Nico.</p>
<p><strong>113 nico</strong>: brazenly steps up onto the hood and dives,
grabbing onto the roof.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. lincoln - day</strong>: Salvano can’t believe it. He
screams something in Spanish. He FIRES again, this time through the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>115 ext. lincoln - roof - day</strong>: Bullet holes appear.
Nico narrowly misses being hit.</p>
<p><strong>117 closeup - nico’s hand</strong>: Salvano’s face is bashed.
Nico’s huge hand grabs Salvano’s throat; he won’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>118 closeup - nico</strong>: He hangs on with one hand.</p>
<p><strong>119 closeup - salvano</strong>: Nico’s fingers now dig into
Salvano’s larynx; he may never talk again. He’s gagging. Salvano now
points the gun at Chi Chi. Chi Chi makes the decision to stop the car in
order to save his boss.</p>
<p><strong>120 nico</strong>: leaps off the roof pulling Salvano past
the broken glass, out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>121 several police vehicles</strong>: SCREECH into the lot.
Officers pour out, guns drawn, surrounding the Lincoln and the other
vehicles. Jackson joins them, weapon in hand.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo?</p>
<p><strong>123 int. van</strong>: The engine block sits in a wooden
shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the
van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping
frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to
care for the wounded cops and criminals.</p>
<p><strong>124 closeup - engine block</strong>: From the cylinder heads
emerges a full load, not of drugs, but of plastique tubes labeled U.S.
ARMY C-4 HIGH EXPLOSIVE.</p>
<p><strong>127 close - nico</strong>: Confused; frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: What kinda fuckin’ high is this?</p>
<p><strong>128 int. fbi office - night</strong>: OPENING ON SALVANO, in
a chair, looking bruised and swollen, and wearing an expression of
fuming indignation.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: – I’ll tell you what this cop is. He’s a
fucking menace!</p>
<p><strong>129 two fbi agents</strong>: face Salvano, Chi Chi and the
lawyer Abandano . Neeley is on the phone. Pictures of Reagan and Meese
are prominent on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: You see what he did to me?!</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: Your problem is being handled right
now, Mr. Salv –</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Yeah? Well, it shoulda been handled twelve
hours ago. I don’t know who’s running this outfit, but somebody better
get his goddamn wires straight!</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: – yes, sir… yes, sir, I understand
–</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: That maniac should be wearing a number, not
a badge.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: – count on it, sir. Right. You’ll have
our full cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: You’re free to go.</p>
<p><strong>131 int. federal building - lobby - night</strong>: The hoods
and their lawyer smugly walk past a cleaning woman.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. precinct captain’s office - morning</strong>:
OPENING ON Agent Neeley’s face. Composed, clean-cut, but intense,
wearing a light-colored business suit. PAN TO Agent Halloran – the same
upright, clean-shaven bureau look. The two men are seated to one side of
LIEUTENANT FRED STROZAH.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: – This is no reflection on the
work you officers have done. I feel, and the whole department feels,
extremely proud of your initiative and gallantry.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: As all of you are well aware,
possession of these explosives is a federal offense and under
jurisdiction of the F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Sir. With all respect to our brothers in the
Bureau – – That’s no answer. It’s no answer to why one of the biggest
dealers in the city is out on the street now, free as a bird!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: Keep it in your pants, Nico.
These men have a job to do, just like us.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Lieutenant, I think these officers are
entitled to a fuller explanation.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: They’ve risked their lives. I
understand one man is in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: What I’m about to say doesn’t leave
this room. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Mr. Salvano has been working for some
time in cooperation with certain federal agencies.</p>
<p><strong>134 close - nico’s face</strong>: Stunned and furious at this
royal fuck-up.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: I’m not at liberty to divulge the
nature of Mr. Salvano’s involvement – I just learned of its existence
myself a few hours ago. But one thing I can tell you –</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Mr. Salvano’s role is crucial to an
extremely sensitive ongoing investigation. Any further surveillance,
harassment, or unauthorized operations against this individual are
forbidden. I must order you gentlemen – – with all respect for your work
and your courage, to stand down.</p>
<p><strong>136 int. police squad room - morning</strong>: OPENING CLOSE
ON a desk drawer being opened. Aside from rounds of ammo, notes and an
aging eggplant parmigiana sandwich, there are half a dozen hand-labeled
audio- cassettes and a small collection of miniaturized bugging devices.
Jackson and Lukich watch Nico take out the notes, hand them to
Lieutenant Strozah.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: The tapes too.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s my Lawrence Welk collection!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: I want everything you got on
this one.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: I know you don’t give a shit
about yourself, Toscani. But you’re gonna put Jackson’s ass in a sling,
too, with these illegal wires.</p>
<p><strong>136a other side of squad room</strong>: Agent Halloran edges
up to Jackson, who’s grabbing coffee on the far side of the squad room,
and watching from there as Nico gives Strozah more of a hard time.</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: What’s the story on your partner,
Jackson? Did he learn this style or was he born with a brick up his
ass?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: He has ethics. Unlike certain others on
this case.</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: His ‘ethics’ are gonna cost him his
badge and his gun.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You don’t wanna catch him without no
gun.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: ’Cause what he do with his hands… make
bullet holes look pretty.</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: He bad?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Bad bad.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. precinct house - stairway - day</strong>: Nico and
Jackson come down the stairs. Jackson has had ample excitement for her
last week on the force.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Is that enough? Can we do something normal
now – like eat lunch?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Anything you say, Jax. How about
Salvano’s?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Let it be, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>139 int. unmarked car - parked</strong>: Jackson and Nico are
eating some fast good. Nico reaches to his jacket pocket; takes out a
cassette.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What… you kept his tape, too?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Poetry, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: And now for some dessert.</p>
<p><strong>143 series of shots</strong>: As Nico’s car tails Salvano’s
through various streets.</p>
<p><strong>144 ext. oak street</strong>: Salvano comes out of a fancy
flower shop with a bimbo on his arm. He kisses her goodbye and puts her
in a cab.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: And that must be Mrs. Sal. So nice to see
married couples still in love.</p>
<p><strong>144a nico and jackson</strong>: are hidden, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>144b chi chi</strong>: emerges from a dry cleaner’s with a
suit on a hanger.</p>
<p><strong>147 sidewalk in front of church</strong>: Salvano and Chi
Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.</p>
<p><strong>148 int. church - day</strong>: A smattering of older women
and men praying. Salvano and Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle,
genuflect to the altar, move in, take seats toward the front.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: This is your mother’s church, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Yeah. But I bet she’s never seen these boys in
the choir.</p>
<p><strong>151 salvano and chi chi</strong>: After a few moments, the
pair rises. They cross them- selves, start out for the front door. As
they walk, they continue to look for something.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Nicola! That can’t be you in church
without the family!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Father Genarro.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: This must be your partner in crime.
I’m Father Genarro. I saw you at the baptismal party. What a
partner.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Dolores Jackson Nico, we gotta go –</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: No, please – It’s good you stopped
by. I have to show you something. Please.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: The rats are getting bigger.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: When did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Two nights ago. I didn’t call the
police.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: It’s all right, son. These are
friends.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: These are friends. This is Father
Tomassino.</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I didn’t know this church was a sanctuary,
Father.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Yes. But, perhaps not such a safe
one.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: How long have they been here?</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Too long. At least the kids can go
to our school.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Who did it, Father?</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Kids, maybe. Maybe worse. It’s not
the first time.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: We can have a car check by, every hour.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: No… please. Police frighten these
people.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. church - main aisle - day</strong>: The three are
outside, taking their leave. A big smile and a hand on Father Genarro’s
shoulder. The priest is greatly relieved.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Really, I don’t mind coming by.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: Tell me, Nico… When was your last
confession?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’m a married man, Father. I’ve got no sins to
confess.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: You’re a police officer, you have
many sins to confess.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: You come back Sunday. I feel better
when I see Nicola in church. You don’t show, I’m phoning your
mother!</p>
<p><strong>158 various angles - congregation</strong>: An Italian
neighborhood becoming more Hispanic. As the churchgoers file in, we see
families – women, kids, babies.</p>
<p><strong>159 nico, sara, rosa and julian</strong>: are among the
crowd, exchanging pleasantries with friends and neighbors – in English,
Italian and Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. church - side aisle</strong>: Sara, holding Julian,
slips into a pew. As Nico and Rosa follow, Father Genarro passes,
heading for the front.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Father Genarro! I have you to thank for
getting my son back into church!</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: It’s amazing what shame can
accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>the choir</strong>: building to the finish of a hymn.</p>
<p><strong>nico’s wife</strong>: also singing, balancing baby Julian and
a hymnbook.</p>
<p><strong>nico and his mother rosa</strong>: sing with full gusto.</p>
<p><strong>the choir master</strong>: makes the sign to be seated.</p>
<p><strong>congregation</strong>: sits. We notice a young,
intellectual-looking man wearing wire-rim glasses, sitting in the front
row. We will see his face again later. He looks out of place and glances
around, surprised as…</p>
<p><strong>father genarro</strong>: In nomine patris, filius et spiritu
sancti…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Way to go, Julian – perfect timing.</p>
<p><strong>165 closeup - nico</strong>: His head spins from the shopping
bag to the doorway –</p>
<p><strong>167 back to nico</strong>: Instantly he pushes his family to
the floor, covering them with his body.</p>
<p><strong>168 closeup - nico - second later</strong>: BOOM!!! A
POWERFUL EXPLOSION erupts between the priest and his congregation.
Fragments of plaster, wood, and marble come blasting past Nico and his
family! Churchgoers in the first rows are blown off their feet by the
shock wave of the blast. Pews overturn, smoke everywhere –</p>
<p><strong>170 congregation</strong>: is in total pandemonium. Screams,
cries, panic –</p>
<p><strong>171 pulpit</strong>: has been blown to oblivion. Where Father
Genarro had been standing is now nothing but smoke and rubble.</p>
<p><strong>172 nico</strong>: Prone, covering Sara and the baby, groping
frantically to protect his mother as well.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: We’re okay! We’re okay!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Help the others! Help them, Nico!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Help each other move outside. Be calm.</p>
<p><strong>175 ext. side of church - morning</strong>: From a doorway
and a shattered window smoke pours forth. We hear SCREAMS from
inside.</p>
<p><strong>176 int. church</strong>: Nico on his feet, plainly the
leader in this moment of terror. Worshippers, shattered and bleeding,
pour past him toward the door. Nico grabs a stout-looking church-
goer.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Call 911. Tell ’em to send everything they
got! Sara, get the baby and Mama outside.</p>
<p><strong>177 ext. front of church - morning</strong>: The congregation
streams out in terror-stricken disarray. We see Nico’s family – they’re
all right.</p>
<p><strong>178 nico</strong>: appears from the church, carrying a young
choir girl. He hands the child over to two older women, races back into
the church.</p>
<p><strong>179 long shot - street outside church</strong>: The first
paramedic van comes speeding around the corner, SIREN BLARING. Police
cars appear right behind –</p>
<p><strong>180 int. church</strong>: Nico appears through the backlit
smoke and kneels over the bloodied body of Father Genarro. He
desperately tries to maintain the priest’s life.</p>
<p><strong>182 int. hospital room - afternoon</strong>: Nico stands, his
back to the wall – a scary, blank look on his face. A doctor and several
nurses are pulling the plugs on the terribly mutilated body of Father
Genarro. A nun is crying; a fellow priest is blessing the Father.</p>
<p><strong>183 jackson</strong>: arrives. Nico talks to her, aside.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I want a list of everyone that’s been treated
here today. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Then find those sanctuary people, the ones we
saw in the church basement –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Find out where they’re from, why anyone would
want to harm them.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Where are you gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Just stay near a radio. I’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Sara… go down to the car; I’ll be with you in
a minute.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I need to talk to you. … Alone.</p>
<p><strong>185 stairwell landing</strong>: The door closes behind them.
Nico and the FBI man are alone on the stairway landing.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: What the hell is it, Toscani?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You. That’s what the hell it is!</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Get your goddam hands off me!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You let Salvano walk.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Salvano?! Are you crazy? What does he
have to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That was no cherry bomb in there. That was
C-fucking-4! I’ve used that shit.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I know what it smells like, I know what it
blows like –</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Salvano never came near that C-4. It’s
in federal holding now! Besides, why would he blow up a church?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I tailed Salvano. Two days ago. Him and one of
his apes were in that church – and they weren’t taking communion. I saw
some broad saw who was with his lawyer plant the bomb. Now I want some
goddamn answers.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: You tailed him? After I ordered you
off?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Where is he? Where’s Salvano?</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: My orders were release him. Not
babysit him.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: You think you’re rough stuff, Toscani
– martial arts hero, chop suey crap. Well I’ll tell you something:
you’re not bullet- proof. You’re not even a good cop. You sneak around,
playing your street dick games. But all you come up with is conjecture,
wild coincidence and bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I want the agent who signed for the
explosives.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: I’ll do my job. You do yours.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Bank on it, pal.</p>
<p><strong>int. morgue - late afternoon</strong>: Jackson has her list
from the hospital. A coroner and his assitant show her a body on a slab.
The body is that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw in the front row of
the church. Jackson takes notes. The dead man is definitely not the
ethnic type you’d expect in St. Mary’s congregation.</p>
<p><strong>ext. body and fender shop - late afternoon</strong>: The same
place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi Chi. Nico interrogates the
shop boss, several workers. All shake their head, gesture emphatically.
Salvano not here.</p>
<p><strong>187 closeup of dead man’s effects</strong>: as Jackson’s
flash pops. We see clearly a U.S. Senate staff ID, a U.S. Senate office
building parking pass and an Illinois driver’s license with address.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: You gonna be in real trouble, mister, when El
Senor Salvano find out about dis.</p>
<p><strong>189 ext. st. elizabeth’s church - late afternoon</strong>:
Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area off while a TV
news crew photographs the damage. Jackson talks with neighborhood
people, asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>first latino</strong>: ’Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?</p>
<p><strong>first latino</strong>: Don’t even think about it,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: You come to our streets… fuck with our
people. Now our people gonna fuck with you.</p>
<p><strong>pipe man</strong>: We ain’t gonna shoot you, man. We gonna
beat you to death. You gonna learn what it means to ‘get down.’</p>
<p><strong>191 quick cuts</strong>: Nico is trapped. The hoods
advancing. Nico has a</p>
<p><strong>192 ext. street - day</strong>: Shrieks from passersby as
Machete Man hurtles past, straight into the street. A car nearly hits
him, he vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He too leaps
the car, whose owner is staring, cursing –</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Fly, baby!</p>
<p><strong>196 ext. yard behind bodega - day</strong>: Machete Man bolts
from the bodega into a small patio with tables and chairs. He leaps the
fence into the next yard, which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles
the headstone inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side –</p>
<p><strong>197 back to nicco</strong>: pursuing along the same
route.</p>
<p><strong>199 backyard of flower shop - day</strong>: Four young
Oriental women, potting plants, react with terror as the two bodies
CRASH through. Machete Man scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in
the corner next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can’t move
either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The girls retreat to
the far corner, squealing in fright.</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: No, hermano. Please –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Who put up the money?</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: What money?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You didn’t come after me for a piece of ass.
Who paid you?</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: I told ya! No one!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: Jimmy Constanza!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: If you’re lying to me, I’ll come and kill you
right in your own fucking kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>machete man</strong>: Salvano! Bautista Salvano!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Gracias, muchacho.</p>
<p><strong>int. nico’s house - kitchen - night</strong>: Nico at the
kitchen table spread with notepads, old add- ress books, 3X5 cards. He’s
on the phone, impatient, apparently getting nowhere. He slams the phone
down.</p>
<p><strong>click</strong>: he’s been hung up on; he looks at the
receiver in frustration and disgust.</p>
<p><strong>close - corkboard on kitchen wall</strong>: Nico’s hands
pushpin a 3X5 card into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>insert - 3x5 card</strong>: We read: “FBI / Agent Smith /
11:53 / B.S. / Covering for who?”</p>
<p><strong>kitchen - night</strong>: Nico back at the table, listening
to the wiretap tape, transcribing it.</p>
<p><strong>another angle - kitchen - night</strong>: Nico holds Julian,
goes over notes.</p>
<p><strong>close - yellow legal pad</strong>: The page is headed:
“FATHER GENARRO.” Below in doodle formation, are a series of boxes, each
one containing a phrase. We read: “Father G had some- thing on Salvano?”
“Church break-in?” “Drug infor- mation?” “Father G connected to FBI?”
Irritably, Nico’s pencil crosses everything out.</p>
<p><strong>201 sara</strong>: Appears in a nightgown at the kitchen
doorway. She looks frail, frightened. MUSIC ENDS.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I can’t sleep. Will you come and hold me?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Of course I will. I’ve been waiting to hear
from Jax. She was supposed to get back to me by now.</p>
<p><strong>202 int. nico’s bedroom - late night</strong>: Nico comes in
with his arms around Sara. She stops near the bed, holds him tight. They
look to little Julian sleeping in the crib nearby.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Thank God you couldn’t find your shoes. We
would of have been sitting in the front row. Alright, I know the rules –
I don’t ask you don’t tell. But could’ve died today and I deserve to
know. Why did we go to church this morning?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’m willing to break the rules; I’m willing to
tell you whatever I know. But I need some time. Could you just give me
some time?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’ll bet that’s her.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: This better be good, Jax.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s bad, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Long time, Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>203 ext. street - phone booth - late night</strong>: We
recognize Fox, Nico’s buddy from SE Asia whom we met in the opening
sequence. Fox, too, of course, looks 15 years older. He wears a suit and
seems quite prosperous. We are unable to identify from where Fox
calls.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You should know not to use a name on an open
line. I’m gonna talk for fifteen seconds, then I’m getting off. You’re
in trouble, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Serious, serious trouble. Take your wife and
family and get them someplace safe now.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You hear me? Now. I’m risking my ass by telling
you this. Good luck, kid.</p>
<p><strong>206 back to nico’s bedroom - late night</strong>: The PHONE
CLICKS DEAD. Nico tries to keep a casual ex- pression. Sara sees through
it – she knows he’s shaken.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: That was Fox, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Why is the C.I.A. calling you at two in the
morning?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s okay, sweetheart – – You know what a
crazy bastard Fox is. He gets drunk and forgets he’s halfway around the
world. He calls me.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: He just wanted to make sure we got his
Christmas card.</p>
<p><strong>207 int. bedroom - later</strong>: Sara is sleeping next to
Nico. Julian next to her. A LOUD POUNDING comes O.S. from the front
door. Nico jumps out of bed. His gun appears in his hand, as if from
nowhere, he steps quickly to the front window, looks out –</p>
<p><strong>210 int. downstairs - front door</strong>: Nico enters the
vestibule in his pajama bottoms with his gun in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>voice through door</strong>: F.B.I., Toscani. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s a little early for breakfast, O’Hara.</p>
<p><strong>o’hara</strong>: Sorry, Nico. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: I’ll take this, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: No, you won’t. I’m gonna give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>211 int. nico’s bedroom - night</strong>: JULIAN BAWLS
fearfully; Sara holds him, trembling. Nico is hurriedly getting dressed.
A cop and the FBI agents stand at the door.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: This is ridiculous – there’s no need for
this!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s all right, darling.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Who do you think you are – coming in here like
this, treating my son like a criminal?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Why are you terrifying us? There’s an infant
here!</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: Check that coat.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Get your hands off him!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: allowing himself</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: The Police Association’s got lawyers for this,
you bastards!</p>
<p><strong>213 int. police headquarters - late night</strong>: Bad Dude,
the bartender we remember from Nico’s first visit to the Polish bar,
finishes signing a deposition. A cop takes the paper. Bad Dude stands,
glances half- fearfully, half-defiantly to Nico, who is led down a hall-
way flanked by two uniformed officers. Agent Halloran opens the door for
Bad Dude, who exits.</p>
<p><strong>214 int. interrogation room - late night</strong>: Neeley,
Halloran, Lieutenant Strozah and Deputy Superinten- dent JACK CROWDER.
Halloran indicates a stack of depositions, tapes and notes on the table
before Nico.</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: Illegal wiretaps. Unauthorized
surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: When were you born, asshole?</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Associating with known felons.
Disobeying direct orders –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Where’s Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>crowder</strong>: She’s outa this.</p>
<p><strong>agent halloran</strong>: You’re the rotten apple in this
barrel, Toscani. We don’t have to look any farther than you and your
‘family.’</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: Nico! You damn fool! You wanna
go to prison?!</p>
<p><strong>crowder</strong>: Unlawful entry. Illegal search and seizure
–</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’ll never build a frame on this
chickenshit.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: You were ordered to back off on
Salvano. But you had too big a hard-on for that, didn’t you–</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fred. You can’t be in on this.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant strozah</strong>: You’re officially suspended,
Toscani. I want your tin… and your iron.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You holding me?</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: You can walk for now. But don’t walk
far.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Sara, I’m okay. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>215a int. nico’s kitchen</strong>: Sara on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Where are you? Why aren’t you coming home?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’ll be home later. Lukich will be there. Tell
mama not to worry.</p>
<p><strong>216 ext. street - nico, jackson and lukich - dawn</strong>: A
mood of urgency.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: – I found the sanctuary people.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: They’re refugees from El Salvador,
Guatemala, Chile. They won’t talk to me, they’re terrified of cops.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Ready for this? One of the people killed at
the church was definitely not a congregation member.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Alan Singletary. He’s an aide to Senator
Harrison.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That’s right. Harrison. Foreign relations
committee. The guy who’s been crawling all over the Central American
drug connections.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’re gonna make a helluva D.A., Jax.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: God help us.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I’ve been at the Tribune all night, wearing
out their Xerox machine. Harrison’s staff has been compiling some kind
of white paper. He’s due to release it next week.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That’s how Fox knew.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Luke. I want you to go to my house. Call
Branca… my mother has the number. Get my family ready to move out.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: You got it, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Stay with ’em. We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: What’s going on, Nico? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I got a call last night. An old agency friend.
He told me my family was in danger.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: You got a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Try this on.</p>
<p><strong>217 int. day care center - morning</strong>: OPENING CLOSE ON
the faces of the sanctuary refugees. They are faces that have known fear
and tragedy. The kind of faces we see on newsreels after villages have
been burned and family members murdered. The refugees have been moved
from church basement to a back room in the day care center. Nico kneels,
facing them. Jackson in the background. A nun and a priest watch over
the people. Nico is frustrated; he can’t crack the refugees’ fear.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Sister… you know me. Tell them there’s no need
for fear.</p>
<p><strong>sister bonifacia</strong>: There is rubble all over the yard,
Nicola.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I was there… in the church. They tried to kill
my family, too.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I know there was a man here, from an American
senator’s office. Who was he going to speak to?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Was it you, senora? Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>refugee woman</strong>: The priest.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Who? Father Genarro?</p>
<p><strong>refugee woman</strong>: The other one.</p>
<p><strong>refugee woman</strong>: No. The young one. From Costa
Rica.</p>
<p><strong>sister bonifacia</strong>: Father Tomassino.</p>
<p><strong>sister bonifacia</strong>: He came alone… two weeks ago. He
had papers. Papers to give to the senator.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: But the bomb… The bomb was planted to destroy
the pulpit.</p>
<p><strong>sister bonifacia</strong>: Father Tomassino was going to give
the Mass that day. Father Genarro talked him out of it.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It was Father Tomassino they were trying to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Where is Tomassino? Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>refugee man</strong>: He run, mister. He go –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: If you know where he is, you’ve got to tell
me. I want to help him. I can help him.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’re outa this, Jax. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You see this list? Well, I’m not done.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: I’m not a rookie, Toscani. Now, go home.
Get your family out of here.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Just paperwork, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>219 int. nico’s car - moving - morning</strong>: Nico drives,
a jumble of emotions on his face. Urgency fear, exhaustion. He’s deep in
thought –</p>
<p><strong>220 ext. intersection - morning</strong>: Nico’s car pulls up
at a stop light. He looks around without really seeing. An old lady
pulls a shopping cart while a crossing guard takes some kids across the
street.</p>
<p><strong>221 another car</strong>: ROARS up out of nowhere, without
two men inside, SCREECH- ING to a stop head-on to Nico’s door. Its doors
spring open –</p>
<p><strong>225 nico - on floorboard</strong>: crawling frantically;
shoving the passenger door open as a FIRESTORM of lead and FLYING GLASS
BLAZES all around him.</p>
<p><strong>229 four men</strong>: FIRING as shells spew from the
ejection ports of their weapons.</p>
<p><strong>230 nico’s car</strong>: being chewed to pieces –</p>
<p><strong>232 four men</strong>: As their magazines empty. The last
shells spring free, GUN BARRELS SIZZLE, blue smoke fills the air. The
leader waves two men forward to check their kill. At that instant:</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Over here, you sons-a-bitches!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Try it. Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Over there! Move it! – Now!!</p>
<p><strong>234 int. corner grocery store - day</strong>: A Pakistani
counter clerk takes one look at the mob enter- ing his store and bolts
for the rear. A customer exits as Nico herds his captives in.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Hands on the counter!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t tempt me, ASSHOLE –</p>
<p><strong>236 street corner up block</strong>: Two police cars heave
into view, SIRENS WAILING –</p>
<p><strong>237 front doors of store</strong>: Nico takes the last man,
lifts him up, and drives him like a battering ram straight through the
glass.</p>
<p><strong>238 nico</strong>: Wild-eyed and bloody, sees the cop cars
whipping into the corner. He spins to see his .45 on the floor – too far
away to race for. He bolts down a gangway.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Get their stuff into the car now. Do it in the
alley, not the driveway. I’ll be there in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>243 omitted</strong>: &amp; 244</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Your job and your family in one day, Nico.
You’re batting a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Sara…</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’ll be safe with Uncle Branca. It’s gotta
be this way… I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t you think I’d rather be with you?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – Mama… you got your medicine? Don’t forget
the baby’s sweater –</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I know about babies.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: You sure you’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I am if you are.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Don’t worry – We needed a vacation,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>246 ext. alley behind nico’s house - day</strong>: Branca’s
sedan is half-loaded; Branca adds a few more bags. Lukich’s car is
parked behind it.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’ll give you five minutes start. We have to
do it this way.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Where’s Jax?</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: She thinks there may be documents at some
guy’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>247 int. basement - day</strong>: Nico and Lukich enter,
start down the steps.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: They killed the wrong priest.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: There was a second priest… from Costa Rica…
hiding at the church. He was the one they meant to kill.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: And you know where to find him?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: You’re gonna need help.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Just stay with my family</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>249 nico’s pov - looking down driveway</strong>: Two police
cars pull up to the front of the house.</p>
<p><strong>250a ext. suburban house - day</strong>: We see Uncle
Branca’s car and Lukich’s car out front.</p>
<p><strong>251 int. safe house - day</strong>: Branca leads Nico, Sara,
Rosa, Julian and Lukich down a corridor. Two older Italian women open a
door leading to a basement rec room.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: My sister’s cousin’s place. You’re safe –
not even I can find this joint.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t forget your seat belt.</p>
<p><strong>254 int. federal warehouse - day</strong>: Nico walks
casually beside Agent Neeley, holding his gun out of sight in his
pocket. They proceed down a corridor. Be- hind them we glimpse a
security checkpoint, manned by two uniformed guards, through which they
apparently have already passed.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Congratulations, Toscani. You just
made number four on the most wanted list.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Keep walking – – I’m bucking for number
one.</p>
<p><strong>256 administrative window</strong>: A pot-bellied,
Naval-retired-type CLERK looks up from his desk as Nico and Neeley come
up to the counter. We see a sign: “EVIDENCE HOLDING DEPOT – You MUST
Have Your Requi- sition Number!!!” The Clerk stands, chomping a cigar,
wad- dles to the counter. We see his arms covered with tattoos.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What can I do for you, lads?</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: There was a quantity of C-4 explosive
brought in four days ago –</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hell, that’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Right away, pardner. They scooped that stuff
outa here before we even got it tagged.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Who? Who took it?</p>
<p><strong>c.i.a.</strong>: Nico reacts, nudges Neeley once more.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: We’d like to see the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You gotta sign.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yeah… I remember that guy. Flew in special
from Langley. Bomb tech. Real nice fella – – Here it is. Fox. Nelson
Fox.</p>
<p><strong>257 nico</strong>: snatches the release form. Stares at the
signature, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>258 ext. lakefront - deserted section - day</strong>:
Neeley’s car parked in the boondocks along the lake.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: – Here it is, sir. Coming in from Langley
now –</p>
<p><strong>259 int. car</strong>: Neeley holds the radio mike, as if
about to say something. Nico shoves his gun against the guy’s
temple.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: – That agent has been with the Central
American desk, uh, since ’84 –</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Thank you. That’s what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Dump your shoes. Ditch your I.D. on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: So you think I’m a lousy cop, huh, Neeley?
Maybe I am. But I haven’t got my face buried up Washington’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Nobody buys me, Toscani.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Yeah? Then somebody pulled the plug on your
brain, pal. You didn’t come up with the second priest, did you? Or
Harrison’s dead aide. Hurry up! You heard the radio. The Agency’s
pushing buttons and bodies are dropping like flies. You assholes are
missing half the case!</p>
<p><strong>agent neeley</strong>: Listen. Toscani –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>260 ext. deserted lakefront - day</strong>: Nico drives off,
leaving the FBI man miles from nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>261 montage</strong>: with SCORE and V.O.</p>
<p><strong>int. police headquarters - day</strong>: From out of an
elevator and down a busy corridor march the brass, Deputy Superintendent
Crowder included. Lieutenant Strozah lags slightly behind. They enter an
auditorium where a large contingent of press, cameras ready, wait.</p>
<p><strong>int. condo complex - hallway - day</strong>: Jackson outside
an apartment door in a Yuppie-esque condo complex. She looks both ways
to be safe, then slides a credit card behind the lock. The door
opens.</p>
<p><strong>int. condo apartment - day</strong>: Jackson enters, looking
guilty as hell. She picks up a framed photo from a piano: the dead
Senator’s aide posed smiling beside a distinguished-looking man in front
of the capitol building. Jackson sets the photo down, starts rummaging
through desk drawers.</p>
<p><strong>crowder</strong>: The officer is alleged to be involved in
illicit drug trafficking, racketeering and kidnapping –</p>
<p><strong>int. convention center</strong>: Nico, in the crush of
convention-goers, pauses before a booth promoting a TV manufacturer. The
latest model TV’s are set up in a sales display, with visitors gawking
at the pictures of the church bombing aftermath.</p>
<p><strong>newswoman</strong>: Police sources also speculate that
Toscani may be connected to the suspect in the bombing of
St. Elizabeth’s parish church –</p>
<p><strong>newswoman</strong>: – the suspect is likely to be armed and
considered to be extremely dangerous –</p>
<p><strong>newswoman</strong>: In other news, Senator Ernest Harrison’s
presidential bid has…</p>
<p><strong>int. condo apartment - day</strong>: Jax stuffs a wad of
offical papers – including appoint- ment books, notes and tapes – into
her briefcase. At the apartment door, she looks both ways, then emerges,
starts away down the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>int. convention center - computer booth - day</strong>: Nico
in the crowd in front of the booth of a Japanese computer manufacturer.
Dr. Watanabe is the chief engineer at the booth, showing off some
high-tech equipment to several brainy looking executives. Watanabe
glances up, spots Nico. Nico makes a subtle sign to indicate he must
speak to Watanabe. Watanabe crosses at once to Nico.</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: So good to see you again, sir! Come back
near closing… five- thirty… we’ll place your order then.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Listen, Wat… you know I wouldn’t call in a
favor –</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: Of course not. Just because you kept a few
‘friendly’ tribesmen from cutting my heart out and serving it up as Pad
Thai?</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: The last six years I’ve been risking
nothing but money. It’s a kick to risk my ass again.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: The old Spook.</p>
<p><strong>263 omitted</strong>: &amp; 264</p>
<p><strong>265 int. jackson’s apartment - night</strong>: Jackson has
the Senator’s aide’s papers spread before her, cataloging them with
interest. The PHONE RINGS. Jackson picks it up.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: – Yes… yes, of course, sister, I know who
you are. – where… where are you?</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: – No way to access Covert Ops directly.
But Ornstein’s at Princeton, he’s got a database bigger than Langley –
If I can’t crack that turkey’s code, it’s time to hang up my rock and
roll shoes –</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: – ah, here! Here’s a little trap door.
Let’s see if we can wriggle up into – Personnel files! Operative
dossiers. Will that do?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s a start.</p>
<p><strong>267 full ashtray</strong>: Watanabe stubs out a cigarette.
Empty coffee cups all around. Nico paces, reading a hard-copy
printout.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fox has had a helluva career. ’69 to ’76,
Cambodia, Laos. Operation Phoenix. Operation Green Mountain. Operaton
Northstar. This is all Vang Pao, it’s all heroin –</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: You friend has found his metier.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Run personnel retrievals on all these
operations. I want the names of every company man who was on them.</p>
<p><strong>268 close - computer screen</strong>: A list of about thirty
names – mostly civilian, but some with military rank attached.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Altshuler. Cosgrove. I know half these guys –
Okay… now run me an update. Where are these fuckers now?</p>
<p><strong>269 nico - later</strong>: Pouring a fresh coffee, studying
the screen with Watanabe.</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: Central American desk. Central American
desk. Central –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Thirty names from secret drug operations… and
two-thirds of ‘em are in Central America. All right. Run these two
names: Bautista Salvano and Ramon ’Chi Chi’ Testamente.</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: Those street dealers you were talking
about? They’re not gonna be in here.</p>
<p><strong>270 close - computer screen</strong>: Official biographies of
Salvano and Chi Chi come up.</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: Well, kiss my ass. Both former Somoza
secret police. Recruited by agency, 1975. Trained Fort Benning, counter
insurgency…</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Where’s Fox’s printout? 1976… Fort Benning. He
recruited these pricks!</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: There’s nothing left, Nico. We’ve wrung
these files dry.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fox is here, in Chicago… or was here… …
Listen. Can this thing tap into airlines? Reservations records –</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: I can get you the ball scores, too.</p>
<p><strong>272 nico</strong>: As he finishes viewing the screen,
stands.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Five agents from Central American desk. All
trained assassins. All arrived in Chicago in the last week – and none of
them has left.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Thanks, Wat. You finally may have done some
good for your country.</p>
<p><strong>watanabe</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: To find a priest.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: How did ya find him?</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: The nun phoned me. She said two men had
been sneaking around the church. She sounded scared –</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: There’s more. I got the papers from that
senator’s aide’s apartment. Everything Harrison’s been working on. It’s
all at my place.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Once you’re inside, you’ll signal us.</p>
<p><strong>277 int. car - closeup on trembling woman</strong>: It is the
Middle-aged Woman who left the bomb, seen in Father Genarro’s church. A
police sketch of her was seen on tele- vision. She is looking up at the
third-floor window, getting instructions. She turns around occasionally
to see who’s talking to her.</p>
<p><strong>salvano</strong>: Don’t be scared. Your life depends on
this.</p>
<p><strong>278 close on driver</strong>: It is one of Salvano’s goons
we’ve seen before. He is checking his gun.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: Exusame, por favor. Tiene dinero
para…</p>
<p><strong>281 closeup - goon</strong>: He steps quickly, surely into
the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>282 closeup - bedroom door</strong>: It flies open. The goon
points his gun AT the CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>284 ext. apartment - pov from salvano’s car</strong>: The
light in the apartment window blinks twice.</p>
<p><strong>285 ext. tenement - street - night</strong>: From two cars
emerge the shapes of several men.</p>
<p><strong>286 ext. chicago street - night</strong>: Jackson’s car –
with Jackson, Nico and Lukich aboard – swings around a corner into a
traffic jam. The HORN BLARES.</p>
<p><strong>287 int. tenement apartment - third floor - night</strong>: A
STEREO SPEAKER BLASTS MUSIC from the front room. CAMERA PANS ACROSS
Bonifacia’s bedroom dresser. We see mementos of her life and a photo of
herself with Father Genarro with a group of children. CAMERA CONTINUES
TO PAN PAST Bonifacia’s bed, PAST Bonifacia’s body! CAMERA CONTINUES
DOWN TO the floor, where lies the lady who planted the bomb. They both
appear dead.</p>
<p><strong>290 priest’s pov - tv table</strong>: Atop its rickety
surface: a fearsome array of syringes and drug vials.</p>
<p><strong>291 back to father tomassino</strong>: He glances up from the
hypodermics –</p>
<p><strong>292 priest’s pov</strong>: INTO FRAME moves Kurt Zagon! We
see clearly the 15 years of aging since SE Asia. His face is even
scarier than when he performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon
prepares a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: You’ll be in heaven in a few minutes, padre.
But first I’m going to put you through hell.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: You came here to talk to the Senator’s aide,
didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: I tried. But you killed him
first.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Who told you about our plans?</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: This is from confession. I tell no
one.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: You wouldn’t lie to me, Father? It’s a
sin.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: If you spoke to anyone, tell me now – – and I
won’t have to use this.</p>
<p><strong>295 ext. tenement - night</strong>: The unmarked police car
pulls up, across the street.</p>
<p><strong>296a pov from car</strong>: In the shadows by the corner, a
hulking Latino man loiters.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: That’s an eyeball if I ever saw one.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’re our backup. If we come out running,
then you can shoot.</p>
<p><strong>297 ext. tenement - night</strong>: Nico and Lukich exit the
vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent building; he and Lukich start for
it.</p>
<p><strong>298 int. apartment</strong>: Father Tomassino is beginning to
come under the influence of Zagon’s chemicals. In spite of this the
priest’s spirit to resist is astounding…</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Speak to me, Father – who did you tell?</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: I know what you are. I know what
beasts you are.</p>
<p><strong>299 ext. adjacent building - roof of tenement</strong>: Nico
and Lukich emerge from the roof door, guns drawn. The roof is empty.
Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair creep soundlessly onto the
next roof. They cross toward the roof door like infantrymen, moving one
at a time from cover to cover, covering each other. They reach the door
that leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of the
enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door open –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: I want to know who you told.</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: I told them… you make the ninos…
see… castrating their fathers – raping… mutilating their mothers … And…
… and sometimes… to the ninos…</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: – Tell me the truth, Father –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: – Can we kill him? If you told anyone, about
our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it.</p>
<p><strong>father tomassino</strong>: Nadie. Nadie. Nadie.</p>
<p><strong>305 nico and lukich in hallway</strong>: O.S. we hear another
ELEVATED TRAIN APPROACHING outside. Nico kicks the apartment door in! He
and Lukich burst in, guns clutched two-handed.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Get him! Finish him!</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>308 intercut - elevated train</strong>: THUNDERING along the
tracks adjacent to the building.</p>
<p><strong>309 ext. roof - night</strong>: Nico highballs from the
stairwell as the tarpaper roof erupts all around him with GUNFIRE from
the floor below! He dives sideways, rolling to avoid the fire – He
recovers his footing in time to see Salvano and Zagon burst onto the
roof from the stairwell. Nico’s BULLETS miss them; they separate, taking
cover behind two walls at the roof’s margins. Nico is trapped – in the
open.</p>
<p><strong>312 angle - elevated train - moving</strong>: Nico lands on
the roof of the speeding “el” train, his momentum nearly carrying him
off the far side –</p>
<p><strong>313 nico - atop train</strong>: catches a railing, claws at
it. BULLETS rip into the train roof all around him –</p>
<p><strong>314 atop tenement roof - salvano and zagon</strong>: FIRE for
all they’re worth at Nico’s receding form.</p>
<p><strong>315 atop train - nico</strong>: crawls to the space between
cars, lowers himself down. He clings to the swaying chains.</p>
<p><strong>315a int. train car</strong>: Nico staggers through the
almost empty car and collapses on a bench.</p>
<p><strong>316 around corner - two police cars</strong>: hurtle INTO
VIEW under the El, SIRENS BLARING.</p>
<p><strong>317 back on tenement roof</strong>: Zagon and Salvano
scramble away.</p>
<p><strong>319 ext. el station - stairway to street - night</strong>: A
cleaner, more upscale neighborhood. Nico labors down the steps,
clutching his jacket to his ribs. Several affluent people look at him
oddly, he ignores them, keeps going – He makes his way up the street,
weakening, to a tasteful brown- stone. Nico climbs the steps in pain
–</p>
<p><strong>320 int. jackson’s apartment - bathroom - night</strong>:
Nico over the sink, shirt off, WATER RUNNING – applying a makeshift
bandage to his bloody ribs. We see Jackson’s make- up stuff along the
counter, feminine robes hanging on the door, law books around a reading
stand. Nico is in real pain, exhausted, weakening –</p>
<p><strong>321 living room - night</strong>: Nico at Jackson’s desk, its
surface spread with the notes and papers she got from Senator Harrison’s
aide’s place. We glimpse them: photos of Central American atrocities,
dead bodies, etc. He tries to study them, quickly, but his attention
shifts –</p>
<p><strong>322 insert - framed photos</strong>: Jackson with her sisters
and their kids, Jackson in law class, Jackson and Nico posing, smiling,
at the police shoot- ing range –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – Had to be a hero… another fucking hero. I’m
sorry Jax.</p>
<p><strong>325 omitted</strong>: &amp; 326</p>
<p><strong>327 back to nico</strong>: Nico scoops up the aide’s papers,
stands, wobbly –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – Senator… – – dumb fuck… think they’re gonna
let you put ’em outta business –</p>
<p><strong>327b closeup on</strong>: a bloody flak jacket rests upon the
gurney.</p>
<p><strong>jackson</strong>: You call Nico’s goddamn Uncle and find out
if he’s heard anything.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: You just shutup and take it easy, pal.</p>
<p><strong>328 int. taxi - night</strong>: CLOSEUP of Nico riding
through the wet streets.</p>
<p><strong>328a int. emergency room</strong>: Lukich is on the phone.
His shirt is off and he’s being bandaged. In the background Jackson is
also being cared for.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: We don’t know what happened to him, Branca.
Ya, she’s gonna be alright.</p>
<p><strong>328b int. branca’s safe house - night</strong>: Branca, a
bodyguard next to him, grimly puts down the phone. He looks
devastated.</p>
<p><strong>329 ext. driveway - branca’s safe house - night</strong>:
From the darkness, Nico appears, barely making it up the driveway. We
hear the sound of the CAB DRIVE OFF.</p>
<p><strong>330 ext. branca’s safe house - night</strong>: Branca and a
bodyguard come forward, grabbing Nico as Nico almost collapses.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: The motherfuckas got Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Lukich called. She’s not dead. She’s gonna
make it. She was wearing a vest.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That broad didn’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>332 int. branca’s safe house - night</strong>: Rosa has
pulled back the curtain from the second-floor bed- room window. She
witnesses the arrival of the doctor. On the bed behind her sleep Sara
and Julian. A bodyguard stands outside the bedroom door.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: It was picked up with your mail this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>335 back to nico and branca</strong>: Nico’s grim expression
shows he knows just what this means.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Don’t worry, they’re booked on an early
plane. They’ll be out of the country tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Oh my God, Nico!</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: He’s fine. The boy has ribs of steel!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Enough of your humor.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Leave them. Leave them alone.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: – You’ve got to do it, Nico. You know you have
to.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Listen to her, Nicola. Whatever you think of
him, Federico is family. He is our family.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Ever notice how clean babies smell? Like
nothing in the world has touched them yet.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: If you won’t go to him, I will.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Don’t push me like this –</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Branca can put us on a plane – but where can
we fly to? Tibet? The moon? There’s nowhere they can’t find us.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You don’t know what the hell you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: I’m talking about everything I’ve learned from
you in the past five years.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You know I can’t go to him.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Do you know why I love you? Do you know what
it is about you that I’ve always loved? Pride. It’s what you have
inside. You don’t live the way other people live. You trust what you see
as right and won’t let anyone or anything make you stray from it.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: But now that pride may kill all of us. You’ve
got to swallow that pride, Nico. Choke on it if you have to. Lay it
aside.</p>
<p><strong>339 another angle - nico and sara</strong>: Close together,
with their baby between them. Sara buries her face against her husband’s
chest. Nico’s arm goes around her. He holds her tight.</p>
<p><strong>340 close - nico - against wall - day</strong>: He wears a
suit and tie, a hat. All business.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is this the attorney?</p>
<p><strong>another man</strong>: You can come now, Mr. Carlucci.</p>
<p><strong>341 another angle</strong>: To reveal bars which slide
electrically to the side. A prison door opens, letting him through.</p>
<p><strong>342 angle - prison corridor - day</strong>: Nico, escorted by
a prison guard, walks down a long, blank hallway.</p>
<p><strong>343 nico</strong>: Waiting in a barren reception room.
Several benches, tables; heavy steel mesh over windows –</p>
<p><strong>344 nico’s pov - across room</strong>: A steel door opens on
the far side. Out steps a small Italian man in his seventies, wearing
the faded denim of an inmate.</p>
<p><strong>345 int. prison corridor - long shot - day</strong>: Nico and
the small man walk together down a long corridor, speaking occasionally,
the tension thick between them. Behind them, a discreet fifteen paces,
walk two armed prison officials.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: I am only an old man. An old man
with a cancer.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I don’t have much time, Uncle. So I must speak
plainly.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – For as long as I’ve been old enough to
think, I’ve hated you and hated everything you stood for.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I was so sure that you and I were on opposite
sides of the fence… and that you and your people were destroying this
country –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – The most painful realization of my life was
that the people I worked for and you are not far apart. – And there’s
not much difference between what you are and what I was.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: I will be candid with you. I
knew, probably before you did, that you would be coming to me. I knew
what you would ask… and I had every intention of refusing you.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: But it is a form of wisdom to
know when to cease relying only upon yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: You know, of course, that this
Senator Harrison will never live to make his speech tomorrow. You know,
too, that as long as this man… this torturer –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Kurt Zagon.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: – As long as this Zagon lives,
nothing I can do will guarantee your family’s safety. ‘Ecce non uomine,
ecce bestie.’ You know Dante? ‘These are not men, these are
animals.’</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: Memorize this address.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: Have you got it in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>349 int. admin building - reception room - day</strong>: The
old man takes his leave of Nico with a warm, if formal handshake. The
guards stand by, waiting.</p>
<p><strong>frederico larusso</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Carlucci. I trust
you will give my love to my niece, Rosa.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I will do that, Mr. Larusso. I hope you will
be well.</p>
<p><strong>350 larusso</strong>: nods: “Bene.” Then: without a word he
turns and exits back through the steel door.</p>
<p><strong>352 corner near branca</strong>: Hidden by a bank of phones,
Sara clings to Nico, holding him as tight as she can. When she releases
him, we can’t hear what she says, but it seems like, “Be careful, please
be careful.” Nico glances to Branca, who motions subtly to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>353 ext. o’hare - runway - day</strong>: An Air Canada PLANE
BLASTS skyward.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: You got the architect’s drawings? Wiring,
floor plans –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s all here.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: I could help you from here on.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: It’s not your business.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Grazie, tio caro.</p>
<p><strong>branca</strong>: Take care of yourself, Nicola.</p>
<p><strong>356 omitted</strong>: thru 360</p>
<p><strong>361 telescope pov - chicago skyline - night</strong>: CAMERA
PANS TO the apartment complex across the plaza. FOCUS ON one suite on
the topmost floor. Curtains are drawn on all windows, but through one
crack we glimpse a man pacing. The man wears a white shirt and a
shoulder holster.</p>
<p><strong>363 lower telescope pov</strong>: BACK TO the apartment
suite. Now another man crosses before the gap in the curtains. Wearing a
cowboy hat: Zagon! He’s laughing, pouring himself a drink at the wet bar
–</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Not even you can hit him at this range,
Nico.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: That wasn’t the plan, Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>366 nelson fox</strong>: covers Nico from behind with a
silencer-fitted .45. He glances to the briefcase and building plans, on
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Close range, huh? Never work. Place is rigged,
scanned every 35 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I was thinking of a mine on the roof.
Remote-triggered, when the chopper comes in.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Roof’s wired too. Sensors every fifteen
feet.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You can turn now. Slowly. Slooowly…</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I figured you’d do your recon from this
building.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’re looking fit, Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Getting a bit of a tire.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Your own tailor?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Hong Kong.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You’ve gone a long way.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Uh uh. Uhhh-uh… I know what you can do when you
get too close to a man.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I don’t believe you, Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: – What’s so hard to believe. I want to help
you, you dumb guinea!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fox the fixer.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: If I wanted to cap you, I’d have saved myself
this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I’d be
White House material.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Is that what Zagon is? One of your basement
boys?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Zagon’s a rancher. 4000 acres in Costa Rica.
Beautiful place.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Bought with what – opium from Cambodia?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: And a ton a week of coke from other places.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Which he funnels here through Salvano. With
the Company getting its cut.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Legal tender.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Still dodging appropriations committees, eh,
Nelson?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: That’s my job, Nico.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out,
stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage.</p>
<p><strong>367b int. lower corridor</strong>: Nico and Fox emerge from
the elevator. Nico lowers his hands from behind his head. Fox keeps his
gun out of sight as he and Nico step past.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: The Senator couldn’t be bought, could he? He
was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Keep walking.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: But the priest found out somehow and ran here.
You couldn’t do the Senator’s number ’till you knew if the priest had
talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was
in on it – and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.</p>
<p><strong>370 parking garage - valet station</strong>: Several guests
and diners wait by the cashier’s booth for their cars to be fetched.
Valets hustle with tickets. Fox and Nico come off the escalator.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: If your name was Joe Smith I never would have
caught it. But how many Nicola Toscani’s are there?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You got it off the arrest sheet.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had
wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn’t let ’em go.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy
trying to figure a code, I didn’t even recognize Zagon’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: So we kill our own senators now.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why not? The Romans did.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Are we the Romans?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: We’re an empire too.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin?
I’m trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep
under, no names, no numbers –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Doing what – processing heroin?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: You ‘consult.’ You ‘assist.’ You send checks to
your family. Zagon won’t touch you, you’ll be on the team –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: In five years you’re out, with a fat Swiss
account and a GS-15 pension.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: You know, Fox, right now in Israel they’re
trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our
country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people.
And probably they all deserve it –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – but you and I know a couple guys personally
who are responsible for the murder of at least what… 60,000 non-
military personnel. Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers,
doctors… women, children… and that’s just a sliver of it.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: We’ve wiped out entire fucking countries. And
not one agent –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Stop right there!</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: – not one C.I.A. agent has ever been tried or
convicted, much less accused of any crimes. You motherfuckers think
you’re above the law – Well, you ain’t above mine.</p>
<p><strong>371 a big car</strong>: SCREECHES to a halt in front of them.
Five men dismount swiftly. Salvano, Bad Dude, and two agent types from
the tenement… and Zagon! Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and
Fox, playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the
bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Well… well. What a team we have here.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: We’ve been looking for you, Nelson. I see
you’ve found our friend.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Thanks for the help, Fox.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: I didn’t bring him, Nico. I swear it!</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Have you two been sharing fond memories?
Reminiscing about the good old days?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Stay still! Don’t fucking move!!</p>
<p><strong>evening gown woman</strong>: Jack –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Bring in our friend, Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Be a good boy –</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Dive, Nico!!</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>373 ramp to lower levels</strong>: A valet rounds a corner,
unsuspecting, bringing up a car. Nico is on him like a cat, tearing the
poor boy from behind the wheel, leaping in –</p>
<p><strong>374 zagon and salvano</strong>: tear around the corner at the
top of the ramp. Both OPEN FIRE as –</p>
<p><strong>375 nico - in car</strong>: highballs straight toward
them!</p>
<p><strong>376 salvano</strong>: hold the trigger down, FULL AUTOMATIC
–</p>
<p><strong>377 nico’s car</strong>: Nico drops below the dash, driving
blind. The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART, both FRONT TIRES EXPLODE, the
RADIATOR BLASTS</p>
<p><strong>378 zagon</strong>: Reloading as Salvano FIRES.</p>
<p><strong>379 nico’s car</strong>: pinwheels out of control, its nose
facing away from Salvano and Zagon. The car BRAKES FURIOUSLY –</p>
<p><strong>380 nico</strong>: hits reverse, looking back over the seat
–</p>
<p><strong>381 nico’s pov - through rear car window</strong>: He sees
Salvano, his clip empty now, hurrying to wrestle a fresh magazine in
–</p>
<p><strong>383 salvano</strong>: A horrible death.</p>
<p><strong>384 nico - behind the wheel</strong>: BURNING RUBBER
FURIOUSLY, away from the wall –</p>
<p><strong>385 zagon</strong>: Reloaded, turning his gun toward Nico,
when –</p>
<p><strong>386 two uniformed hotel security guards</strong>: hurtle
around the corner from the escalators, guns drawn.</p>
<p><strong>first security guard</strong>: You there –</p>
<p><strong>389 zagon</strong>: scampers free. Nico gets to his feet,
bleeding. Nico is between Zagon and Zagon’s machine gun on the ground.
Zagon bolts for his car. Nico dives for the gun –</p>
<p><strong>390 car</strong>: Zagon floors it into a SCORCHING 360,
BLASTS up the exit ramp, out of Nico’s line of fire –</p>
<p><strong>391 nico</strong>: leaps into the other, half-destroyed car.
Its two front tires are flat, windshield blown out, RADIATOR POURING
STEAM. Nico does the only thing he can do: puts the pedal to the metal
in reverse, BLASTS across the ramp divider, takes off after Zagon in
reverse –</p>
<p><strong>392 on ramp - zagon’s car</strong>: Another car is coming
down. Zagon sideswipes it into a wall, keeps going –</p>
<p><strong>393 on ramp - nico’s wrecked car</strong>: Rear TIRES
CHURNING smoke, FRONT FLATS SCRAPING on their rims… he pours on the
speed –</p>
<p><strong>394 top of ramp - hotel access drive</strong>: Zagon’s car
whips out into the night-time commotion. Pedestrians, POLICE SIRENS O.S.
Zagon looks behind him –</p>
<p><strong>395 nico’s car - top of ramp</strong>: hurtles into view in
reverse!</p>
<p><strong>396 zagon’s car</strong>: is trapped by the traffic. Zagon
looks around wildly, then floors the accelerator. Zagon’s car bucks
straight up the pedestrian steps, onto the plaza! Strollers scream and
scatter as it fishtails wildly, careening toward the huge stone fountain
–</p>
<p><strong>398 zagon</strong>: leaps free, sprints toward the hotel
alley. Nico takes off after him on foot –</p>
<p><strong>399 ext. alley - rear of hotel - night</strong>: Zagon races
down the darkest of alleys, rounds a corner –</p>
<p><strong>400 nico</strong>: hurtles after him, gaining. Nico whips
around the alley corner, straight into:</p>
<p><strong>401 four armed agents</strong>: waiting beside a plain grey
TV remote van. Nico skitters to a stop as a shotgun, an M-16 and two
pistols cover him. Shotgun Agent raises his weapon to fire –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: No! I want him! I want him alive!</p>
<p><strong>404 int. basement room - night</strong>: Sweating, windowless
concrete. Overhead pipes. Churning machinery. As the CAMERA REVEALS this
airtight dungeon –</p>
<p><strong>pistol agent</strong>: – this is bullshit, Zagon. We got work
to do.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: All work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy.</p>
<p><strong>405 nico</strong>: in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of
him. One agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped
tight around Nico’s throat. Shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its
twin muzzles inches from Nico’s skull.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: We’ve got an hour before the honorable
senator. You’ve got to learn to take time, smell the roses.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: How are you gonna do him, Zagon? In a
motorcade? Or passing through a hotel kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: I’ve used these little beauties many times to
extract information – – This’ll be the first time I’ve ever used them…
just for fun.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Take his arms.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Hold him up!</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now
it’s where you’re gonna check out.</p>
<p><strong>407 nico</strong>: reacts instantly to the hypo – cursing,
sputtering under the choking noose. He twists wildly trying to free him-
self, but the agents’ powerful arms hold him.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: That’s it. Fight it, cherry. Fight it, so it
speeds faster on its way –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your
brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart –</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: That’s my boy. That’s what I was waiting for
–</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a
wise man learns from the mistakes of others – You should have killed me
when you had the chance, Toscani –</p>
<p><strong>408 zagon - against wall</strong>: On his feet again. He
reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife. Nico
confronts him – face battered, bloody – shaking, battling internal
spasms.</p>
<p><strong>zagon</strong>: Can you feel the chemicals, cherry? You can’t
fight ’em much longer –</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Long enough to finish you.</p>
<p><strong>412 main lobby - rear - nico</strong>: weaves wildly forward.
He drops to his knees. Guests react in astonishment and horror.</p>
<p><strong>412a jackson</strong>: is the first to spot Nico. She runs up
to him as he collapses.</p>
<p><strong>412b nico</strong>: looks at Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>413 lukich and neeley</strong>: reach Nico and Jackson.</p>
<p><strong>lukich</strong>: Is there a hotel doctor? Call 911!</p>
<p><strong>414 nico</strong>: passes out in Jackson’s arms. Behind them
we see a banner, announcing Senator Harrison’s address. From the
ballroom we hear CHEERS and APPLAUSE. A fiery address is being finished
inside. The senator is now leaving.</p>
<p><strong>417 buick station wagon</strong>: escorted by two police
motorcycles, pulls in. The press surrounds it as Lukich, Neeley,
Lieutenant Strozah and Jackson, her arm in a sling, disembark from the
car.</p>
<p><strong>418 reporters</strong>: shove mikes and cameras at the
senator and the judge, shouting questions. Lukich, Neeley and Strozah
clear a path for them.</p>
<p><strong>419 angle from inside house - through front window</strong>:
Harrison and Alspaugh fend off the questions, cross the path and mount
the steps to the house.</p>
<p><strong>t.v. reporter</strong>: – Senator Harrison has today issued a
statement calling for the appointment of a special prosecutor –</p>
<p><strong>420 int. nico’s house - day</strong>: Nico, propped up on the
couch, looking like hell, but de- finitely conscious and in full command
of his faculties. Sara, Jackson, and Rosa beside him.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Earlier this week, the Harrison Commission
delivered its report on the growing C.I.A. scandal to Congress…</p>
<p><strong>senator harrison</strong>: – officially-sanctioned deceit,
murder and corruption, will continue until these men are brought to
justice.</p>
<p><strong>422 nico</strong>: looks up as the real Senator Harrison,
Judge Alspaugh and the others enter the room. TV SOUND DOWN. Harrison
stops before Nico, taking a moment to look with respect and ad- miration
at the man propped up on the pillows.</p>
<p><strong>senator harrison</strong>: Detective Toscani. I wanted to
personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth
to finally come out.</p>
<p><strong>senator harrison</strong>: And this is Clayton Alspaugh of
the fifth circuit court.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge alspaugh</strong>: Are you sure you’re feeling well
enough?</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: If you’re ready to listen, I’m ready to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>423 close - stenographer’s hands</strong>: As the Judge’s
VOICE begins OVER, “slating” the depo- sitions, the stenographer’s
fingers start moving.</p>
<p><strong>425 ext. yard outside nico’s house - day</strong>: The press
corps, vans, neighbors – CLOSING CREDITS BEGIN.</p>
<p><strong>script processing department</strong>: 954-4632</p>
