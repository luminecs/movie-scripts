<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I will talk to you of art, for there is
nothing else to talk about, for there is nothing else…life is nothing
but homeless traveler on the RTD of art…</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Burn gas on the freeways, and whip your
sour cream of circumstance…flip at your channels and plod at your
monitors…</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Creation is, all else is not… what is not
creation is meatless sausage, and rice cake, let it all crumble to feed
the artist -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The artist is, all others are not, a canvas
is a canvas or a painting, a rock is a rock or a statue, a sound is a
sound or it is music, a preacher is a preacher or an artist - Walter
passes ART, seated with two attractive women - he rolls himself a
cigarette, nodding in approval to Maxwell -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Where are John Joe Jake Jim Jerk, dead dead
dead, they were not born before they were born, they were not born,
where are Leonardo, Mozart, Shakespeare, alive alive alive, they were
born -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Bring on the multitudes and the multitude
of fishes - feed them that you will be satisfied, nourish the artist,
stretch their skin upon an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so
that he may mold them, let them die, and by their miserable death become
the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark - that he
might take you in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder -
all that is comes through the eye of the artist -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: The rest are blind fish, swimming in the
cave of aloneness- swim on you mortal and muddling maddened souls - and
dream, of one bright and sunny island - some artist will bait a hook,
and let you bite upon it, bite hard, and die -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: In his stomach, you will feed creation!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Walter, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was just looking at Carla’s picture.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well that’s not what I pay you for, now is
it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well I was uh, just looking…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well do some looking around the room. I see
cups, ashtrays - let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Ah, your new head shot… I like it, very
much…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Do you have to be so cold to him?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: How ya doin’?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Alright we’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Anything new?</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came
in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn’t see much changing hands.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Is the manager cooperating?</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Yeah, he’s keeping an eye out, said he’d call
us if he sees anything. That’s about it for tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Alright I got you, man. It’s my turn for freak
patrol.</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: You know it. I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: So, do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: It’s perfectly adequate, as far as those
type of things go…</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I don’t think anyone gets what I said,
their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it
very much.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Well I’m overjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: “Let them die, and by their miserable death
become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark
-”</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: That’s word for word.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Is it? I’ve forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: You mean you don’t remember your own
poem?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I refuse to say anything twice - repetition
is death!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: When you repeat something, you are reliving
a moment, wasting it, looking at a shed skin - I only want new
impression, new sensations -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought you believed that life is a
homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I know that - I know that! I also believe
in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be
uncreative you might as well be dead…a walking machine, toiling in a
factory!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I worked in one of them. Back in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Walter, Leonard’s looking at you again.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That guy’s a class-A cracker.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Walter’s got a clear mind. Probably
something will enter it, feel lonely, and leave again…</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: I’ve heard you can find some cutting edge
pieces here if you keep an eye out -</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: I’d like to find something for our den,
something unusual -</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Well maybe these works might interest you
-</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: It’s our road kill series. I take the
pictures.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I do the research.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Yes, we’re interested in something with
some investment potential -</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Hey, this is no supermarket, there are no
aisles, it’s all in the attitude -</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Yeah that’s a dead soul way to look at it
-</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Nonsense. We have developed many a
rapport with struggling artists - we’re very supportive -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: “All that is comes through the eye of the
artist - the rest are blind fish, swimming in the cave of
aloneness.”</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: That’s very deep, and coming from a bus
boy too - WALTER “Feed them that you will be satisfied - the artist is,
all others are not -”</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Where have I heard that before?</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Are you a poet also?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh…no. No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, uh, I’m…working, I’ve been working on
something, it’s not ready yet.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: What is it, a crying clown?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Walter must have bought himself some
crayons.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Get out of here, man. We’re negotiating a
deal.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I am working on something! I’m going to show
you soon!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You’re starting to try my patience!</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Is he, uh?…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: About to be out of a job.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you done with these?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Yes, get rid of them…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT JABBERJAW - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What are you looking at? You want to get
shot?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Hello Walter. I want to tell you the
super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, OK.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter you look awful pale! What did
you have to eat today?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: If you were my son…why don’t you let
me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won’t take but a minute.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh no, that’s OK, I can fix myself
something. Besides, I got something important to do…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Oh by the way did you happen to see
Frankie out here, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, no, I didn’t see him at all.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: What’s got into that cat? Well if you
do see him, tell him I’ve got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut
for him -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: T-tell him that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: If you see him.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK Mrs. Swicker.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Good night Walter…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good night, Mrs. Swicker -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Now I have my muse…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT WALTER’S ROOM</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A canvas is a canvas or a painting. A rock
is a rock or a statue…a sound is a sound or is music…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Come on…you’re supposed to be a nose…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why can’t I make a nose!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No no no no -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Frankie shut up!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t believe this! How did you get stuck
in the wall!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Alright alright - calm down, I’ll get you
out -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hang tight Frankie, ol’ Walter’s gonna get
you out…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Frankie how’re ya doin’ in there?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh Frankie I’m so sorry…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Poor Mrs. Swicker… She had a nice fat piece
of ocean-fresh halibut for you…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Repetition is death, Frankie… DISSOLVE
TO</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Nourish the artist, stretch their skin upon
an easel, crush their bones into a paste, so that he may mold them, let
them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands,
that he might MAXWELL form an ashtray or an ark - that he might take you
in his magic hands and wring from your marrow wonder - all that is comes
through the eye of the artist -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where are the John Joe Jake Jim… Jerk…</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Dead…dead…dead…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’m trying to find a style of my own. Do you
really like them?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Oh yes…very nice…very, very nice…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hi Walter…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What are you doing here so early?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well I brought something, I wanted to show
you.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What is it, your laundry?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t worry about him…what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A thing I made.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Wow… Wow…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Leonard…look at this…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Where’d ya buy that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t buy it I made it.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You…made that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I said I did, didn’t I!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like this, maybe
Segal, but nothing with such… dichotomy… It’s very good, Walter -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Honest?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well, what’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Dead Cat!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Dead Cat?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well it sure looks dead enough.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You want to buy it, put it in the club?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You want me to buy Dead Cat? It’ll scare
people away.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t you feel it?</p>
<p><strong>leonard and walter</strong>: Feel what?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Don’t you feel what it’s giving off?
It’s…presence… come take a closer look…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Look at the detail, it’s so alive, and yet…so
dead…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Look at the expression on its face…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well…why did you put a knife in it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Got carried away, huh?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Alright, I’ll tell you what. I’ll put it in
the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we’ll split it fifty- fifty.
How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure! So I guess that means I’m an artist
after all.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Maybe so…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I wouldn’t give up your day job.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: All that is comes through the eye of the
artist…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Alright get a grip on yourself Now since
you’re here why don’t you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You really like it?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Of course…it’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I can barely contain myself. Now chop
chop!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you see my cat?</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Why, is he lost?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No, I uh…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You like my cat?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Yeah…it’s like out there, you understand
what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure. You want to buy it?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: No man, I don’t have the funds to be
buying various pieces of artwork, you understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: People seem to like my cat.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Enough already about it - get to work!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hey Walter, come here!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Congrats, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Walter everyone’s talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I saw your…cat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you like it Mister Brock?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Call me…Maxwell.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’d ya do it Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh, I just got some plaster, and fixed it
up.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Papier mache?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, no. Plaster.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Attention everyone! Everybody!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: As you pass through these yellow portals I
am sure you noticed on your right a small plaster figure, and assumed
this transfixed effigy to be the work of a master sculptor. Indeed, so
it is. And that bright, new creator is in our midst. He’s none other
than Walter Paisley, our very own bus boy, whose undiscovered hands of
genius have been carrying away your empty cups of frustration!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Remember him. His is the silent voice of
creation. Within the dark rich soil of humility, he blossoms as the hope
of our nearly sterile times.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Bring me a gimlet.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Hey congrats on the cat Walter. I wonder where
you got the idea of dead animals.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Huh ?</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Yeah, can you say plagiarism?</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Not only that, he copied us!</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Oh nonsense! Your works hit the viewer over
the head. They’re so…obvious.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: I get it Walter. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What do you get?</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Your work, the layers of irony.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: He made a cat.</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Outta plaster.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: See you later -</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: Righto.</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Where’s my mocha latte double grande!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone’s
really crazy about Dead Cat.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes they are, aren’t they? Look, why don’t
you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well I don’t know -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No, it’s Ok…you came in early. Besides,
you’re creating an incident. When people are applauding they don’t order
anything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Look, go home and…work on something. Make
another cat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t have another cat!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I’m sure
you’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A parakeet?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Go home.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK…good night Mr. De Santis!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Good night Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Wait - Walter!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello Mayolia.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Walter, you did something to me with your
work tonight.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: With Dead Cat?</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: With Dead Cat. Like a breath of fresh air.
I could just - babble on about it for hours.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Yeah. I really could. I’m not just saying
that.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: It’s like…you’ve turned on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: T-turned on?</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.
I want to be warmed by it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s really nice of you Mayolia.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Let me into your world Walter… let me into
that white hot inspired world.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I can’t. I gotta go home.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Well, I’ll go home with you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh no, I couldn’t do that. Mrs. Swicker
would start asking questions. She’s my landlady.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Isn’t there anything I can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t think so Mayolia.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: I want to be part of it, I want to inspire
you, I want to do - something!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t have to do anything!</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Then let me give you something then…</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Maybe this will give you some inspiration,
change your perception of reality…</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: I want you to have it. There’s a little
something for you in here…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Gee. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Let it inspire you. Maybe it will let you
think of me.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: If you have to go, go.</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Go and don’t look back.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why yes, that is one of my pieces… it’s one,
in a series…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: And I love you too Carla…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hello, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi. I know you! I’ve seen you down at the
Jabberjaw plenty.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yes, you have. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was going to make some pancakes, you can
have some if you like.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hm.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you see my cat?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah I did.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I also saw the girl give you this.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she’s a nice girl.
She’s kind of strange, though.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You like chasing the dragon, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Chasing the dragon? Whaddya mean? You sure
you don’t want a pancake?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You can cut the crap.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Police officer.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re like an undercover guy!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re in some deep shit pal, whether you know
it or not.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Huh?!!!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Possession of narcotics isn’t something we take
lightly, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: But I got a feeling you’re gonna cooperate with
me. Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends. Why don’t
you tell me about your connection.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: C-connection?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m not looking to pinch you! I don’t care
about you, or the girl. But you want to save your ass, you better start
telling me what I want to hear. Now!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Telling you what?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who’s the head honcho! Who’s providing the
smack connection!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Smack?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Alaska! What the heck’s wrong with it!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Haven’t you ever heard of smack! Horse! Junk!
Heroin!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is that what that is? I never seen any
before. I always thought that stuff was expensive!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oh, yeah. It can get real expensive.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wasn’t that nice of Mayolia to give me some
expensive smack.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who do think you’re dealing with, huh? I’m
willing to cut you a break, chief!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You are?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Good ol’ mild mannered Walter! Give it up. It
doesn’t fly with me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I- don’t know what you’re talking about!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You’re coming downtown with me, Walter. You’re
gonna come clean with me, you’re gonna name names or I swear to God I’ll
see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding
each other?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wait a minute! What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself,
use your head.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t do nothing wrong! That was
Mayolia’s! I didn’t ask her for it. I don’t know about any -</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Yeah yeah yeah - look! I’ve heard this song and
dance before, save your breath, you’re coming with me! Lou goes to turn
Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Wait a minute - I told you I didn’t do
nothing wrong!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Don’t give me a hard time Walter! You don’t
want to get me mad! You’re coming with me!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I ain’t going no place with you!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re gonna shoot me!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What are ya, deaf? Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: NO! NO DON’T SHOOT ME I DON’T WANT TO GET
SHOT!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Relax!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: YOU’RE GONNA SHOOT ME!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Walter shut up and relax!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: NO YOU’RE GONNA SHOOT ME DON’T SHOOT -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter are you alright? I thought I
heard some shouting a minute ago!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter open this door - The clanging
continues - Mrs. swicker jiggles the door handle - the door opens -</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: What’s all the noise in here!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Noise Mrs. Swicker? What noise?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Don’t tell me I didn’t hear a racket!
I’m an older woman and I don’t need to be upset and disturbed in this
manner!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was just straightening up the place.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Straightening up indeed! Are you sure
you’re not alone?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know
that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter have you been talking to
yourself again?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.
Somebody’s got to.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Walter, you know what you need is a
girl!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: She doesn’t have to be pretty… just as
long as she takes good care of you…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, I can take real good care of myself,
Mrs. Swicker!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Yeah I can see that! Look at this
place!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: It’s terrible! Why don’t you ever
clean it up!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: And when did you change these sheets
last! It looks like they’re alive!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends
later, and I have to take a shower!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Well why don’t you clean up this
dump!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: What’s the matter with you!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t mean to hurt you, sir… if you had
shot me, you’d be mopping up my blood now…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I couldn’t help it if I got scared. I didn’t
mean it!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s crazy…it’s crazy… I didn’t think I had
it in me… How’d ya do it, Walter…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He said go home and make something Walter!
Make another cat…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But I told him I didn’t have another
cat…</p>
<p><strong>art</strong>: No, nobody seems to know where he went… why
don’t you put an A.P.B. out and I’ll check on it from here… Right…Ok,
bye.</p>

<p><strong>link</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: I mean it’s like, you know, I do my art
because that’s what I am, you know? I’m an artist. I’m not like a
banker, you know. Like I create.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I know, man.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: But it bugs me when someone rips off our
ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell
us ours stinks!</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I know, man.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: I mean, screw them, you know? I’m just gonna
go right on creating ’cause it comes from here - you know?</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I know, man.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: And, man who is this dude? He’s like always
casing the joint.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I wonder what his deal is.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: I think he’s looking for you, man… it’s all
finally catching up with you!</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: No I think they’re looking for Walter, ’cause
he’s wanted for stealing -</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Jeez, take it easy Walter!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sorry about that Mr. De Santis!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: That’s alright Walter…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Put the tray down…have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: H-have a seat?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Have a seat -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I thought I’m not supposed to sit with the
customers…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Now why shouldn’t you, Walter? Things are
different now…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They are?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Of course they are, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You’ve arrived. You’ve been recognized.
You’re a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Leonard, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hiya Carla.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: What am I doing? I’m just telling Walter
the truth.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: A man came in here and wanted to pay me
fifty dollars for the cat. In fact, he took it home to show to his wife,
in case you’re wondering where it was.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You know what that proves?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What, Mr. De Santis?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It proves I’ve underestimated Walter’s
ability. His work has hit a nerve in the collective zeitgeist of the art
community. It has enormous realism - you can hardly tell it from the
real thing!</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Sounds like he’s busting your chops,
Walter.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Are you trying to be funny?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m totally serious!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: The question is what are you going to make
next, Walter? Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet? How about
making something out of the cockroaches in your room?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I-I already got a new one!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Great! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s a…full length life-size figure!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Murdered man.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Murdered…man?…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: When do we get to see it? WALTER Well…any
time, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Man that’s a trippy name, kinda like the
Warhol mayhem series…</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: I saw a statue once called The Third Time
Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Now what kind of statue was that?</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: I don’t know it was made out of driftwood and
dipped in sulfuric acid. It was out there…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well…why murdered man?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know, it just happened, I guess. I
didn’t mean to.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You didn’t mean to what?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, I mean it could have been something
else, but it just worked out that way.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: It’s called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with
the program.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah it was all just an accident.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yes…I’m uh…I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: You don’t look so hot… CUFF You must have had
some of the food -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I think he really is sick…</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: So who isn’t around here?</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: I tried to contact you by phone but I
couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Excuse me I have to make a call…</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: I want that cat. I’ll pay you one
thousand dollars - cash.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere…</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: What offers have you got for it? I won’t
be out-bidded. I’m a wealthy man and I don’t mind paying for something I
want.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I can’t talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: What do you want for it? Two thousand?
Three thousand?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No…look I’m busy…</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Listen to me…I don’t want to lose this
piece -</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I’m holding for Lieutenant Beldere!</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Listen to me, listen to me…I’ve been
collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you
something. This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X
factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the
hacks, and I want that cat in my hands. Are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Can’t you see I’m busy here?</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Alright you want to play hard… to insure
I get that cat I’ll give you five thousand dollars - cash, right here,
right now…</p>
<p><strong>plump</strong>: Two thousand for the cat, and a first look at
the kid’s next stuff.</p>
<p><strong>voice on phone</strong>: Lieutenant Beldere.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Someone has the cat just now but I’ll have
him back in a few days. And you can have it for five thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Alright…thank you sir, I consider it a
bargain.</p>
<p><strong>plump man</strong>: Call me when you’re ready… good
night.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Are you feeling better Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yeah, I’m feeling a lot better.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Listen, I’m going over to Walter’s after the
place closes. I want to get a look at Murdered Man. Do you want to come
along?</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: INT WALTER’S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Look at the size of it!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not really that big I got it on kind of
a stand…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, well, I’m a little nervous, I never did
a person before.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You can do anything you want if you set your
mind to it.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It’s hot in here…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You want me to open a window or
something?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Come on Walter, take off the sheet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Don’t you like it?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Like it? It’s a masterpiece. I’ve never seen
anything like it before… and I hope I never see anything like it again.
Walter smiles and looks at his creation -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I have to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Take it in…in it’s eloquence… modern man in
all his…self pity…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: How did you ever find it all in yourself,
Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It wasn’t easy.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Nothing…nothing at all.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: I’ve never seen anyone so… squeamish. Well,
what’s your opinion, Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Oh come on! Even you can see its value.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Do you think you or I could have conceived of
such a thing, much less have executed it?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Well then admit it, it’s a work of
genius.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I admit it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We can bring it down to the Jabberjaw.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: No. Why don’t you cover it up Walter…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Why don’t you cover it up, Walter!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: What’s wrong with you, why do you want to
hide it?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Well, I’ve been thinking… I didn’t realize
how much…talent Walter actually had. It would be wrong for us to show
them one at a time. Dead wrong.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: You’re right. We should build a collection
first.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: That’s it…that’s the idea! Maybe when it’s
big enough we can have a show!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A show?! Like this Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years
and years…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It will take years to make that many
statues. But your work would be featured.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: That’s the idea, Walter. It’s the only way to
gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be
there, it would be an event.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Yeah then you could unload - sell this
stuff for a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A show..how soon can we go?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: These things take time Walter… but for now
you’ve got to break out of this one…avenue you’re on…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Carla and I will guide you, help develop
and evolve your work…maybe lead you toward something more abstract…</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Abstract? With his talent for realism?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You see the direction his realism takes!
It’s unhealthy!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Look you said I was a genius! If I’m a
genius I don’t want to be a bus boy anymore! LEONARD Well maybe you have
a point there, you shouldn’t keep working at the Jabberjaw. Look…</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Now look - Dead Cat’s money in the bank,
I’m sure that man’s going to buy it, so here’s your half in advance -
twenty five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: And if you need more, I’ve got it, don’t
worry. I have faith in you Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Gee..twenty five dollars for something I
made!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Now you’re a professional!</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Good night, Walter. And keep up the good
work.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: But don’t burn yourself out, Walter. You’ve
got all the time in the world. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: What’s going on!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m an artist Mrs. Swicker! A professional
artist!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swicker</strong>: Good night…</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: One of the greatest advantages to modern
poetry is the overload of sensations from which to draw, everywhere in
our minute lives, our TV’s and our information traffic jam! The goal is
to filter those sensations to articulate our awareness! And I’m proud to
say my poetry is understood only by that small minority which
is…aware!</p>
<p><strong>attractive girl</strong>: Aware of what?</p>
<p><strong>mayolia</strong>: Not of anything stupid! Just aware!</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: There’s that weird dude again.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Man if this place doesn’t cool out I’m gonna
hang out somewhere else…</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Get a load of this -</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Hi Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Carla…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll have a Taft’s-Sorrel mineral water, a
piece of papaya cheese cake, and, and a grande cappuccino.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maxwell.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: I see the rewards of achievement have come
your way.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well I am starting to have some success now,
with my pieces…</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Man look at that get up !</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Looks like that cat paid off in spades.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Let’s check out the scene.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I was just suggesting to Walter that he
experiment with more abstract themes.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Why do you suggest anything to Walter? Are
you the spokesman for society coming to poke your stifling finger in his
eye!</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: And a hearty good evening to ya!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Oh now who invited these two, down from the
clouds?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Maxwell!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Clear the table and bring me a bowl, I may
be sick!</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: It’s Alice Ziobro, here to spread a little
cheer -</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Do you like my haircut?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: It’s enchanting.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Where have you been, Alice?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I was up in Seattle working on a video.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Oh yeah? For who?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Petroleum Function.</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah it’s for their new CD.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Don’t you work here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Not anymore!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: That’s right, Walter has sold his first
sculpture.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh. Really.</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: This guy’s a clown and he ripped off our
concepts.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Now he’s trying to act cool about it. Someone
needs to pop his bubble.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: And what project looms on the horizon,
Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I do life modeling, you know.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Would you like to do me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I just might.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’d be glad to help. For $50 an hour.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Never mind that. Walter’s going to try
something abstract.</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: There you go again! I may take my business
to the Snake Pit!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: As a matter of fact I was going to suggest to
Walter that he try a female figure. It would be a departure from the
mayhem/death theme. You really should, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: If you like, I’ll be your model, for
free.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I couldn’t. Not you.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Would you pose for me for free?</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Well, it all depends, Leonard…</p>
<p><strong>cuff</strong>: Man if you want to be a legit artist you have
to do nudes, nudes, nudes…</p>
<p><strong>link</strong>: Right. Ain’t no body of work complete without
some… nudes -</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Get these Philistines out of here!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh let’s change the subject I’m sick of
hearing about sculpture! No one knows how to do that anymore, especially
the bus boy from the Jabberjaw…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Who do you think you’re talking about!!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Look at you! Who do think you are. You’re
just a poser trying, and failing, to fit into the scene!</p>
<p><strong>maxwell</strong>: Strong words… …for such a simple mind.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I think this bit about him being this
discovered sculptor is a bunch of baloney and a cry for help.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s not true I am a sculptor!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Prove it! Make something out of this!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There! Flat Cake!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: If you were an artist you could have created
something!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m going home!</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Alice? You’re a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you
this evening.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: So you apologized! Good night!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Listen schmuck, why don’t you get out of here
and let me go to bed!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t finish talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well I’m done talking to you, what do I have
to do, draw you a diagram!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I decided to make a female figure after all!
I want you to pose for it.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well I’m touched. You’re serious, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Fifty dollars an hour, right?</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Well, if you’ve got the money, I don’t mind
posing. When do you want to start work?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: What, right now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Hold on…I’ll get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to</strong>: EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: It’s kind of dark -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You could use a little more heat in this
place -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s bad for the clay. You’ll get used to
it…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: I’m almost ready -</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sit in this chair, and I’ll pose you.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Do you like what you see?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Just stay like that.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That doesn’t look like very much clay.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh it’s enough…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Are you nervous, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: N-no…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Not even a little bit?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I already told you I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: When’s the last time you had a totally nude
girl in your room…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Um…</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and

me! I didn’t know you loved me until you kissed me.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: Walter, I really do like you. And I did kiss
you. But… that was because of your work.</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong>: There’s more to being in love than just
that.</p>

made that statue of Alice?!</p>

but there is no way we’re ever going to get…together. You know what I
mean?</p>

friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if
Walter Paisley is born!</p>
