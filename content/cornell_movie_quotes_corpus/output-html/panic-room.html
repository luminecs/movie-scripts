<h1 id="panic-room">panic-room</h1>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: – seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep,
forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement
apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait
for the car…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No cars. Feet are faster.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: How many more do we have after this?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: None, there’s nothing else, you know how
tight the market is.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: This is it? I told you on the phone, I have to
be moved in in two weeks. Sarah, please don’t bounce that here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom, it’s the sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh, that miserable little prick is already
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: One day you will learn to respect other
people’s time, Lydia, one day you –</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait
for us!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: This is the middle of the house, the entry
floor, living room’s over there. The kitchen floor’s below us and
there’s two bedroom floors above.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s an enormous amount of space for the money
and I’ll be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I don’t have to tell you there is an acute
shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly
unique property.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No ball, kid.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Working elevator. Mr. Pearlstine, the previous
owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life. Highly unusual, the
elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Will they take asking price? I need a two week
escrow and I’m already approved for the loan.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: What say we see the house before we dicker,
hmm? I have to warn you, this is exactly the response we expected to
get. It’s a very emotional property.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Who taught you to negotiate?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s not like Saks’, Mom, you don’t have to
pay the price on the tag.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m sorry. Apartments, and… money, and… this is
more my husband’s area.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Was. His area. I’m not very good at…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Things, and if I can’t prove to my soon to-be
ex-husband that I can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live
in the next fourteen days, it’s going to get ugly between us.
Uglier.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It would be so lovely if I could shot the
property before I leave!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Top floor. Two bedrooms, one bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have
you. Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: He’s talking about Bernard Pearlstine.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Master bath.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: The hotel guy? It’s been in the papers
lately. His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a
total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or
something, now it turns out they can’t find half of it. Somebody took
something didn’t belong to them!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I hardly see how family gossip is germane to
showing the property.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Stop calling it the property, you sound
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Master closet.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Could the child please stop that?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: And we emerge in the master bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Something’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I don’t know, doesn’t that corner seem funny to
you?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: I was waiting to see if you’d notice! On
caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s called a panic room.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep,
in medieval times.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh, I’ve seen these…</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: It’s quite in vogue in high end construction
right now. One really can’t be too careful about home invasion.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Hey, this is perfect for you… Absolutely!
You’re a woman, you’re living alone now. Your alarm goes off, or you
head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone’s broken into
your home in the middle of the night. What are you going to do? Call the
police and wait until they get here on Tuesday? Traipse downstairs in
your sexy little underthings and check it out? I think not!</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Reinforced steel core walls. Buried phone
line, completely separate, not connected to the house’s main line and
never exposed throughout the house’s infrastructure or outside the house
– you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation
system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you’ve got plenty of fresh air
for as long as you like. And a bank of video monitors –</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: – covering almost every corner of the
house.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Makes me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Ever read any Poe?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I don’t think so, but I love her album.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No, Edgar Allen.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: The furniture guy?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What’s to keep them from prying open the
door?</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Steel, four inches thick.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Everything’s spring-loaded, even if the
power’s out it’s fully functional.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Old Bernie didn’t miss a trick with this
room, did he?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: And with kids like he’s got, no wonder he
wanted a place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: That’s highly inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I said open the door.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: My room. Definitely my room.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: That door is a safely hazard.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Infrared. Like the beam in an elevator
doorway. Won’t let the door close if something’s blocking it.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Watch.</p>
<p><strong>evan</strong>: Push that button for me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Too many stairs.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Got us in here, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shoulda got an apartment.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Well, I know that now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: 478-0150.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Battery’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: The phone works. Hey, I hooked up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The crowd goes wild.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: 478…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: 0150.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Perry’s Pizza, please hold.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fuck her too.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I agree. But don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: “Tom’s throat felt so dry and tight that it
was a moment before he could make any sound come out.”Dad!” He croaked.
“I’m - inside - the - machine!” “Great Scott!” The elder scientist
gasped. He dashed across the laboratory and switched off the
repelatron’s motor. “What happened, son?” “The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
Get a solvent, quick – you know the formula!”</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Bypass non-ready zones… shunt, enter, zone
number…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Bypass non-ready zones… ah, shunt, enter, shunt
again, zone number… wait…</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: A woman and a little girl, both asleep
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: They’re not supposed to be here!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: This was your department, Junior.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: They’re not supposed to be here!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: That’s why the key didn’t work, they
changed the locks.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Fourteen day escrow, man, that’s almost
three weeks! They shouldn’t be here for another week! They don’t own
this house yet!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Exactly how is fourteen days almost three
weeks?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Fourteen business days. Escrow is always
business days.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: I mean, right? Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: You’re an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Watch your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: It’s okay, Raoul.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Who is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Raoul is cool. That’s all you need to
know.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: This is insane. I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We can still
handle this. Can we still handle this?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: It’s just the woman and the kid?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Unless Daddy comes back later.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Daddy’s not coming back, she’s in the middle
of a divorce, it’s just the two of them. We’re okay, here. We can do
this, right?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You’re fuckin’ A we can do this.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Not with me. Not with people.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Forty-five minutes. That’s all you said you
need. That’s like nothing.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: She’ll call the cops, they’ll be here
before I get unpacked.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: So we keep an eye on her. Raoul can totally
administrate that part.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I don’t want Raoul to administrate that
part.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: They won’t get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What about us? What if she has a gun?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Raoul, what in God’s name do we do if she
has a gun?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you
insult him? Hey, who’s the idiot? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Where did you get this clown?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: I met him at the tables, same as you. And
frankly, I’m grateful we have a little muscle right about now.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What tables? I’ve never seen him
before.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Different tables.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: The fuck did you bring a gun for?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Peace out.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: We can’t do it without you, Burnham.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: It’s still a good plan. It’s just… got a
twist.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yeah. Kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Not if we keep ’em here. You can’t kidnap
somebody in their own house. It’s just breaking and entering, unless we
take ’em someplace. Or something like that, I’m pretty sure.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Pure idiot.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: I am. I’m an idiot’s son. An idiot’s
grandson. I’m third- generation idiot. But for once in my life I had a
good idea, and I’m not giving up so easy. You are? Are you actually
telling me that for the first time in your life you’re gonna throw your
cards on the table and go home early? I can’t believe my eyes. Fourteen
million dollars upstairs, Burnham. You’ll be out of the hole. Baby,
you’ll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for
the next twenty years and still shit green. Come on, Buddy. One more
hand.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: No face.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Top floor, get the little girl and keep her
there. I’ll bring the woman up. Gimme.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Stay here. Nobody gets past you.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Wake up… wake up…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Wake up…come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: People. In the house.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’s going down.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That room!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. you gotta…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It doesn’t work?!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Different phone line, I never hooked it up!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Tell me… tell me they’re not in there…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Can’t hear a thing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do they want?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I don’t know. Rob us. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do we do?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What if they get in here?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: They can’t. They can’t get in here. No. They
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I heard you.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Feel okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Shaky?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Chills?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Huh uh.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: The police are on their way.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I suggest you leave.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: How’d he know that?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Take what you want and get out.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: “What we want is in that room.”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They’re coming in here, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No, I told you, they can’t. It’s not a
possibility.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What do you know about this room?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: We’re not coming out. We’re not letting you in.
Get out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Say fuck.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: “Get the fuck out of my house.”</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Get the fuck out of my house!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Answer.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh, please.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Conversation’s over.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Got her right where you want her,
Junior.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: When you said you’d let ’em go I thought
she’d come running right out for sure.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Shut up and let me think.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I’m afraid to let you think, Junior. Things
get worse when you think. Oh, that’s gonna help.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: What if she called the cops?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: She didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: She said she did.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: She lied. Cops woulda been here by now if
she called ’em. Besides, Junior cut the phones.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: What the fuck is funny about this?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: God.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: There is not one thing funny here.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Who else but God could think this shit up?
I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I
gotta figure out how to get in. God, man, He just loves the irony.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Yes. Yes, it’s all terrible ironic and
amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Can’t. Whole point. Can’t get in the
room.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Make her come out. And when she does,
that’s when we gotta be careful. She can’t get out of this house. She
can’t even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here
and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don’t want Joe Pesci
here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.
That’s a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs
of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven. So we’re gonna seal
the place up. They wanna hole up in here? Fine, we’ll help ’em. Make it
impossible for them to leave. Once they come out of that room.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: And why exactly would they want to come
out?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Workin’ on it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Hey. Relax, okay?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I mean it, lie down. You get your adrenaline up
and you know what’s gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you freaking out?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Little bit. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Small space?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Don’t though.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What am I, a five year old?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why did the chicken cross the road?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I don’t know, why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: To prove he wasn’t chicken.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What the hell are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: … locking us in…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Not here… not here… someplace else… someplace
else…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom?! Mom!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom, please!!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I am. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m here. I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: We’re fine. We’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: He said open it.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Just sending a message. She’ll get the
point.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: We ain’t playin’, here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What, what, what is it?!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: On the floor! Get on the floor!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Look, don’t be stupid…</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: We’re trying to scare them, not kill
them!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: They’re coughing.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: They’re gonna die in there!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please
have the balls to follow through with a good idea? Think about it, what
would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come
out?! Huh? We’re just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes,
forty-five fucking minutes! The worst that’s gonna happen is they pass
out, we drag ’em out here into the fresh air, and they’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we
supposed to get into the room if they pass out?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Cut it back a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: No fucking way.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: He’s right, we can’t get into the room if
they’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Neighbor!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: We’re gonna talk. Downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You stay. Make sure she don’t come out.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Morse code?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Where’d you learn S.O.S.?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: “Titanic.”</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Got him!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Yes, yes, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re never getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: We’re not gonna do anything about him, he’s
fine.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: If you think I’m gonna let my half of the
fourteen million bucks slip away because of –</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: “Half?” What did you, take a nap in math
class? Three people, three shares, one third. Four point six six six
repeating.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I’m just saying, the man is a problem. And
he’s your problem. Wasn’t me idea to bring him along.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: That’s right, Raoul, it wasn’t your idea,
none of this was your idea, it was mine, it’s my family we’re ripping
off, it’s my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my
idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask
a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one! Me, me, me, I, I,
I, at no point did I say “you” or Raoul,” got it?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: He puts his hands on me again I’ll bury a
slug in his ear.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: No, you will not, because without Burnham
there’s no way in hell we’re gonna get into that safe, so as far as I’m
concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you
won’t lay a finger on him, you understand me?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Don’t take no tone of voice with me,
Homes.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: What is this shit you’re talking all of a
sudden? You’re a bus driver, “Homes,” you live in Flatbush, so please
don’t start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I
saw that movie too,</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: … the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Yeah, but where’s the third guy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not in the bedroom. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: If it looks like I can’t get back, just close
the door.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Close it!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Oh, hell…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What’d she get, what’d she get, what’d she
get…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh, no. No, no, no no no no no…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh come on, come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I don’t think we’ll be talking on our cell
phone from in there…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Wires…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Phone…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: … wires.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I saw something, I saw…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: … phone wires!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I may not have hooked up the phone in here, but
I hooked up the main line, and there’s a jack at the base of this wall
outside, I saw it!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Say, while we’re on the subject of
phones…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: When I said cut the line, did you cut the
main line at the junction box in the basement like I said, and which I
repeated, or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: I, uh, I…</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: … hit a little snag finding the one in the
basement.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Strip ’em, expose the ends, try blue first,
blue is phones!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Blue is phones?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Yes, no, I don’t know, do ’em all!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: God damn it!</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: 911 emergency –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m at 26 West –</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: – please hold.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Call Dad!</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: On it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Listen to me! There are three –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Hello? Don’t… are…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’ll know we’re in trouble. He heard me, I
said “There are three…”</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He won’t even know who it was.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What would you think, in the middle of the
night? I mean, three what, three bears? He’ll call the police.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He’s just across the park, this is why we got
places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we’re still
a family, he’ll help us…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He –</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: He WILL.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I was trying not to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m dizzy and thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: She’s never coming out.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: And we’re never getting in.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Do me a favor and don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Jesus, what was I thinking?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Come on, come on… stay with me… you gotta
drink…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit
here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta
bring your blood sugar back up, okay? Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m dizzy, not deaf.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Hey, she’s still a smart ass, excellent sign.
Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Huh uh.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that’s
all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and
you’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What if I keep dropping?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Not an option.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What if I do?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: We’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: The hell we are.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Hey man, after all we went through I am not
walking out when we’re this close.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Close? Are you insane? We’re nowhere near
close! Fuck this, I’ll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they’ll
find the floor safe, and I’ll inherit the shit. Little piece of it,
anyway, it’s better than nothing.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Here. For your time.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Five hundred bucks here.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Nobody leaves.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Observe.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: We’re not leaving. I’m getting in that
room, and I’m opening that safe.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Lookin’ doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out
of ten for attitude.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What if I spazz out?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No biggie, we’ve been through it a dozen times,
I just jab you with the Glucogen.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where is the Glucogen?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh, you know, it’s uh… it’s in the little
fridge in your room.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Hey, quit apologizing, you’re starting to sound
like Grandma. You’re not gonna have an attack. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Would you wait? Would you please just wait
a minute?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: You walk out that door and you lose your
share of the money.</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>junior</strong>: Adios.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Nobody leaves.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Oh God… oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You should see the look on your face.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: The fuck did you do that for?!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Fuckin’ asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives
his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds,
thinks he’s a tough guy, thinks he knows me. You don’t know one thing
about me!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What the h –</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Who’s the clown now? Huh?! Who’s the fucking
clown now?!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Me. I am.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Burning me. It’s burning my eye.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I have the gun.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What? What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: What do you think? Get us into that room.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You can. You’re full of ideas. You just need
to squeeze one out.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You got till the count of three. Then you end
up like him.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: One. Squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: This is ridiculous…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Two. Squeeze harder.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I can’t just…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Th –</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Okay, okay! Okay.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You got an idea?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I got an idea. I gotta check
something.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Okay, look. I know you can hear me. Your
wife and kid are in there. You’re gonna get ’em to come out. Or –</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Or I can’t stop what he’s gonna do. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh God, oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You gotta jab me, Mommy…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: If you leave the house, we’ll kill her.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: If I see a uniform in the house, we’ll kill
her.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh… oh…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You understand?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I just… I just need forty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Saw my face, man. Saw my face.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: – cine, she needs the MEDICINE!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: It’s gonna be cool, kid. Be outta here
before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Hurry up, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: The hell does she want?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I don’t know, she keeps screamin’ the same
thing over and over.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Drugs. She wants drugs. What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Oh, man…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I need…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … ’jection…</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: An injection?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: That stuff?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Can you do it yourself?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Well, I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: I don’t fucking believe this. You gotta
wait.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little
more, and your mom’ll give it to you. You can wait a half hour, can’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Yeah. She can. She’s fine, she’s just like,
tired, she’s gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Tell me the truth, okay? What’s gonna
happen if you don’t get this?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Coma. Die.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I understand. I’ll give her the shot.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You’re wasting your fucking time, man, you’re
wasting my time. You don’t know how to do this, and the longer we stay
in here, the more likely she’s gonna lose it and call the cops!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Are you gonna open the safe?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Then shut up and get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Don’t look at me.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Okay, kid, all I know about this is what
I’ve seen on TV, you gotta talk me through it.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Okay. No talking. No problem. TV don’t lie,
right?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: You seem like a good kid. Your mom… only
saw her for a second, but, woah. Beautiful, huh?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Hey, nod or something, show me you’re still
alive, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Attagirl. That too tight?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: You guys are pretty rich, huh?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Yeah, you don’t think about that stuff.
Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: I know, I know. I really screwed the pooch
this time. I never did anything like this before. Break into somebody’s
house? Not even close. Bad cards, Kid. I swear to God, I been on the
wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards. House. Car. Wife.
Those are some seriously bad cards. And still, every time I pick up a
fresh hand I swear to God, the rush comes so hot and prickly I feel it
right down to my toes because this time, this one time, it might be
there, this time it might be that hand, that perfect hand, that monster
hand. And you thought you were sick.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Feel better?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Woulda been a hell of a dad.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: She’s okay. Now sit down and wait.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Congratulations. You saved her life for ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Police.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You called the police?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: You… scared…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Don’t. Say. A word.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Holy shit… holy shit…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: She’s fuckin’ crazy, she killed the kid! She
just killed her own kid!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: It’s not her fault, it’s not her fault, the
guy must have called them. Look, look, look, she’s telling us.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: She’s gonna handle it.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: She better.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What are you guys – what time is it?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: ’Bout four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: We got a call…</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Somebody called you?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Can we come in?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: We’d like to come in.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No, you can’t come in.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Can we come in?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Stop asking me that. I’m fine. Who called
you?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: You don’t look so good.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the
morning and then tell me I look like hell? Of course I look like hell,
you don’t look so hot yourself, Jack. I’m freezing here, thank you for
checking, can I go?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Your husband says you said “There are three…”
right before you got cut off.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Oh, that phone call…</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Ma’am, if there’s something you want to say
to us right now that maybe you can’t say to us right now, maybe you just
want to make a signal, by blinking a few times, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: That’s something you could do. Safely.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Man, you are good! You mean, like, if somebody
was in the house or something? That’s great, they really train you guys
these days, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No. I’m fine. Cross my heart.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: May I ask what the rest of that sentence was
going to be?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: The sentence that started “There are three.”
What was the rest?</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Okay, look. My husband and I just broke up.
It’s my first night in the new house, and I was feeling a little lonely
and a little drunk. The sentence, if you insist on knowing, was going to
be “There are three things I’ll do for you if you come over right now
and get in bed with me.”</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: But thank God I came to my senses before I said
all that and hung up instead, so nobody would ever know what I was
thinking, unless, of course, two policemen showed up in the middle of
the night to interrogate me about it.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: You want her to show you which three things,
Rick, or should we just go?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: She saw my face. The kid too.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: That’s your problem.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: That’s their problem.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Let me fucking finish this so we can get
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You finish. Then we finish.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: – posed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You’re here with me, you’re already on the
hook for one. Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know
that.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Get the fuck away from me.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: The kid in here. The other two when we come
out.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: You know how this gotta end.</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: They stay in the house.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: Fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>meg</strong>: No camera, no camera, no camera…</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sorry. Can’t control it sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing,
young lady?!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: The walls are steel, right?</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Not that one.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Hey man, it’s the neighbor’s house, who
breaks in through the neighbor’s house?!</p>
<p><strong>raoul</strong>: We’ve got the Kid! WE’VE GOT YOUR KID!! What
the fuck is she thinking?!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: She’s got your gun, that’s what she’s
thinking! The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Almost there…</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Put your hands up.</p>
<p><strong>burnham</strong>: Monster hand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I mean, uptown is close to Dad’s place, but
somebody at school said the Village is really cool, so… I don’t know,
it’s so great to be close to the park and everything… What do you think,
I mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?</p>
