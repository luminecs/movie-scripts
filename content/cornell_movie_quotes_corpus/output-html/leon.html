<h1 id="leon">leon</h1>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: aka The Professional</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: OK. Good. Now you can assemble your
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: The rifle is the first weapon you learn to
use, because you can keep far from the client. The more experience you
have, the closer you get.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No. Always take it off at the last moment,
because of light reflexes. They’ll see you in two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Relax. You must feel at ease.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: OK, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here, this is the light scoop for night
shooting. There, you fix client’s distance… How much to the bench down
there in the park?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Huh… 500 meters?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: 130… 140…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: How can you say it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Look. When you can see his fingers, it’s 50
meters. When you just see his hands, it’s about 80 meters. When you
distinguish arms from body, it’s 120-130. When you see nothing more than
a shape, you don’t shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five
to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.
You can’t miss a client. Never… If the task is delicate or the risk is
too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What, for example?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know
weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic
the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I
plastic.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What if you can’t approach the car or he
changes car?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Rocket launcher.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Oh really? But can you miss the car?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Wow! It’s brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah… Come on, have a little training.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Who’ll I aim at?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Whoever.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No women… No kids….</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Begin from a steady target. It’s easier.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: The fat man down there, on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Try again. The same.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Bull’s-eye.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come on, now a walking one.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good! First shot!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yeah, but I didn’t get him, I got his case
and now he’s behind the tree. What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s not serious, it’s just training. You have
to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve
precision, you’ll train, but on cardboards.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: OK.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, try a running guy.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: The yellow and pink.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: OK.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Shit! It’s hard when he runs!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t lose him! Concentrate. There, reload.
OK, keep calm. Calm, breathe deeply. Look at his movements. Imagine
you’re running with him. Breathe… Hold your breathe… His movements…
Now…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Did you see? First shot! It’s good, isn’t
it? Did I learn well?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Codes!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: For codes, there are two solutions. You have
to choose depending on your needs. First case: you have time. You need
the code for a later time. So, you wait for night, you get a box with
soot powder and blow a little on the keyboard. He does it and pulls out
a screwdriver.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Then you break the little lamp to be sure the
client can’t see anything. You wait for someone who gets inside, so you
have just to see which numbers he touched. Once you know the four or
five digits, you have to try all combinations; once per hour and not
more than a minute to do not get found.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here, wires need the code. Always four
wires.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: May I…?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Pardon. Let pass.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me, but… What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I teach to the girl.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Do you teach her how to break buildings’ doors,
don’t you? Don’t you give a shit about me? Get away before I call the
Police! The man is very nervous, searches in a pocket, then pulls out an
anti-aggression bomblet. He’ll have no time to use it: Leon pulled out
his silenced gun. A shot to the hand and the bomblet takes off. Shot’s
energy makes the man turn around. A second shot in the back makes the
man get over the parapet and disappear in a decorative bush, almost
without noise. Mathilda is immobilized. Leon looks around, then
resumes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So… the wire which starts from the bottom of
the metal part and then, you try the other three wires, one by one.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Simple, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s up? I don’t feel you’re
concentrated.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: It’s incredible! How did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: There, the guy… How did you do that,
without even touching him? Without noise. It’s like you put him away…
How did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: It was brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Look! Even the wall, nothing stops him. The
movement goes on. He uses everything: soil, wall, his rush, his weight.
Life is movement, death is a part of it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So, you have to let the client finish the
movement he started. It’s better, he thinks about other things and he
can’t see death’s arrival. He’s got no time to suffer. He isn’t
surprised. He’s got no time even to think. He departs without realizing.
He departs in the movement he started.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …It’s brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s restaurant</strong>: Leon sits in front of Tony. From
his position, he can see the window on the street.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s a long time, Leon. You missed two nice
contracts, you know.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …You moved too, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same
floor?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Not at all.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s better… You see, it’s my turf, so I don’t
want contracts I’m not informed about, on my turf. I’m not opposing, but
the least they can do is informing me, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon
would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Dirty work, and I kill no women and no
kids.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: That’s what I later told myself! No, Tony,
forget Leon! It can’t be him, he likes too much his job to make such a
slaughter!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Tell me… The money I earn and you keep for
me…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Do you need money?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No… Just to know… Because it’s a long time I
work… And I never did anything with my money… I should do something.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s true, you’re right… Did you meet a
woman?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Pay attention to women, Leon. They are
dangerous, you know?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah… Well… I don’t know.. I don’t know
any.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Listen, think about what you want to do, but
don’t worry, your money is there and it’s safer than in a bank… Banks
are robbed every five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Anyway, you can’t have a bank account, so the
discussion is finished.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Why can’t I have a bank account?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’ll explain you, Leon: they’ll ask you to
fill in a lot of forms and you can’t write and they’ll ask you your job,
your employer’s name and you can’t tell them: My job, I’m a hitman and
my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant’s menu.
That’s why you can’t have a bank account!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But your money is there, Leon. When you want,
you ask me. Take…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Take…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, I don’t need them…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Take them, you never know… If you want to have
some fun. Take, it’s a gift.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ve got a hit perfect for you. I kept it for
you. To be made alone. That’s what you like. Don’t move, I get the file.
Manolo! A glass of milk for Leon!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Keep away. He looks suspicious. A bad guy,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: OK.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I have to put on my glasses… My sight is worse
and worse… I’m getting old… Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Not easy. Armored car, isolated home,
bodyguards all time. I don’t know what he trades, but it’s a good hit
because I’ve got three contracts on him… Three times eight thousand for
Leon. Good deal, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I write client’s data on the back. You have to
be quick, he’s going to quit the city at the end of the week. With the
contracts on his head, I don’t think we’ll see him again.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I come back later for details. I’ve got
something to do and… I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come on, get down!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: You were scared, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I was nervous, that’s all! Where is the
guy?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I killed him… and cut him and ate all of
him… I left nothing for you!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Let’s go home!!!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: We’d a nice walk!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Leon? I think I’m falling in love with
you.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Anyway, this impressed you!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: It’s strange, being in love… It’s the
first time for me…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: How do you know it’s love, if you’ve never
been in love before?… It may be friendship… or the love you can have
with a brother or a father… How can you know?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Because I feel it.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Here… in my stomach… it’s hot.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I always had a knot… No longer…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, I’m… I’m very happy you’ve got no
more stomach ache, but… this doesn’t mean anything. I’m late for work
and I don’t like being late for work.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda? May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes… You can come in.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Take it, please.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I… I’ve got a contract… I’ve got to go now.
It’s urgent. …So, you stay here. You don’t move. About telephone, I let
it ring once then I call you back, else you don’t answer, OK?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Why don’t you take me with you?… I’m
ready, now. You said I learn very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Quick doesn’t mean “ready”. And you can’t
discuss, we said. Right?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Go on learning like this… Then we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: May I go to the cinema?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: For musicals? That’s part of the job!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, you can’t go out.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: During my absence, you have to work on a very
important thing you badly lack: patience.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You see, five minutes ago you said you loved
me and now you hate me… but I prefer this!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I hate you because you depart without
kissing me. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Did you lose your key, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No… I just thought if I’d lost anything…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: And did you forget anything?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah… But “forgotten” doesn’t mean lost</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: How are you, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’m sick with practicing, that’s it…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: I see. You’re good, because I didn’t
hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to
lessen noise.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Huh? That’s smart!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’m used to it. Not everyone likes
music.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yeah, true. But what does your father
exactly do for living?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Composer.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Huh, that’s good!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yeah, but he’s not exactly my father…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …No… he’s my lover…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’m going to have a walk… I’ll come
back.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda’s old building</strong>: Mathilda slowly gets to her
floor. In front of the door, a thin yellow “no entry” police strip. A
cop is distractedly guarding the hall; he’s talking with a young black
girl. Mathilda gets in her apartment unnoticed. She gets in her room,
recovers her teddy bear and her Polaroid. Then, she gets in the
devastated living room. There’s dry blood almost everywhere. In the
corridor, she raises one of parquet’s boards. A big roll of 100$ bills
is hidden beneath. There is a small check-book too. She carelessly puts
everything away. Noise in the apartment. Mathilda crouches down.
Stansfield gets in together with two more guys. Mathilda can see them
without being seen. Stansfield is evidently not at ease, he’s justifying
his actions in front of upper-rank officers.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: So, the guy was there, he’d hidden a
shotgun behind the tent, here. His woman was armed too.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Where were the kids during first shots?</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: I don’t know… that was very fast. I
didn’t see him pulling out his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Did you follow the procedure? Who got to
the door?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The fact you’re a public officer doesn’t give
you the right to do whatever you want! The narcotic had been following
this guy for two years. They had a lot of information about him. Your
quick lonely action upset them. It’s normal they asked for an
inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: I give a shit about the narcotic
department! And if you’ll go on searching in this shit, you’ll fall in
it. You can find me at my office… 2702.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s routine, why are you doing this to us?</p>
<p><strong>in the street</strong>: Stansfield gets on a car and departs.
Mathilda stops a cab and gets on board.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: May you follow that blue car, please?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Do you also want music and skids at every
turn?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No, I want you to drive smoothly, get your
100$ and tell me what the last question was.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What’s that man’s name?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Why do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: He forgot his money… My mother’s got a
pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl,
and I can’t let you in. But if you leave me his money, I’ll give him it
myself.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Give me his name, I will mail him.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Office 2702.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Yeah… How do you know it?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …I heard he said… That’s all… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …It’s for you… It’s a gift.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Would you like me to open it? …I open it! …Do
you like it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …You can leave whenever you want. I don’t
refrain you.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …This is what I don’t like, you see: you
don’t refrain me, but at the same time I can’t get out!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do you think you learnt patience today?!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …You stayed home, not bad. A good start.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’ve been out all the time, stupid!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I got home to get my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Here. Not 8000. They’re 6800. I hope you
will credit me for the missing 1200. Furthermore, I’m going to make your
work easier: the guy is Norman Stansfield. Office 2702 at FBI, 5th
Avenue, 68th Street.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And… How do you know all this?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Are you calmly telling me you spent the day at
FBI?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No! I can’t come in! I remained outside!
And why do you mind this? You’ve got client’s name, money’s on the
table: it’s a good contract, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Not taken.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Well… Then may you rent me your gear for
the day?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I never rent my gear.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Why are you doing this to me, Leon? Why
don’t you take me with you for contracts? If you teach me, we’ll can do
mine together! That would be good, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, nothing is the same, after you kill
someone. Your life changes forever. You’ll can never cancel it, neither
from your memory, nor from your criminal record… You’ll never sleep
again like before, Mathilda.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: If you knew, Leon…! I killed one thousand
in my head… And this never disturbed my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: OK… And if it’s you who gets killed? …Then?
Talking about other people’s death is easy, but what about yours? She’s
here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second.
Because it was your day, your hour, your second…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Painful, isn’t it? You don’t like talking
about death because you’re like everyone: you fear it…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Well, it’s this fear that makes you live.
It’s because you fear death that you live with so much tenacity. It’s
because of it that you bear what’s unbearable. You can live in a hovel,
on lots of trash, everything is better than death and the fear you have
of it. But me… Leon… I don’t fear it any more… They look at each other
for a moment. It takes a long to lose it, this fear, but once you lost
it… You are free… And just then you can start working properly… Because
you can work on other people’s fear, play with it… Because “kill or get
killed” have become just words… Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …You can’t pretend to make this job, until you
get beyond this stage. The day you get free of this fear… Not
before…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Leon… I have no fear… It’s so.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: OK…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: One shot ahead… I start.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Love or death. She gets the barrel in her
mouth and looks at Leon. A tear drop on Leon’s front. She pulls the
trigger. Nothing. She puts down the gun. Leon stands up, turns around
the table and embraces her. He holds her tight. She’s surprised. She
kindly pushes Leon back, to look at his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Am I ready?</p>
<p><strong>morning - a few days later</strong>: Leon and Mathilda in a
’50s building. Slightly luxury. Leon checks emergency exits, then gets
in front of a door. He moves his hand along door’s border.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m looking for chain’s position. Sometimes
you can’t see it, but you can feel it… Here.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I ring and you make him open, OK?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Good morning, Mister… It’s Danielle!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Huh! You made an error, baby. I don’t know any
Danielle.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …I got lost, Mister.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Huh? Move back, baby, I can’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: It’s not me, it’s dark here… and I can’t
find the switch.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Mister… I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Huh? Don’t move, baby.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Open your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good… Safety, now. The second shot. Mathilda
approaches the man and shoots again. Maybe too low: a squirt of blood on
her dresses.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here it is! Look at your dresses, now! How can
you walk in the street, now?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s true… But a first contract, it’s an
exception.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: And… May I kiss you, like in the movies,
may this be an exception?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …I’m going to kiss you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, stop, please!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Come on, let me do. Just a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Stop. Everyone is looking.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they’ll
notice us.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Tongue, please.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, that’s enough! Sit down, now.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …You don’t believe me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: When I say I love you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, don’t resume, please. ….Change
subject, OK?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …OK. I love you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda?!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when
you had your first contract?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …17.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Beat you!</p>
<p><strong>another day - another apartment - rain outside</strong>: The
building is a little more modern. They arrive in front of a door.
Peephole. Chewing-gum. Shears. Ring. Routine. But today nobody replies.
Leon nods. Mathilda rings again. Again nothing.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Stairways cover. Mathilda pulls a gun out of
her jeans and gets in position near stairways. Leon pulls out a metal
plate and slides it beneath the door, breaks the lock by the crowbar.
The door is virtually intact. Leon gets in, weapon at hand. Leon moves
in along the corridor. Mathilda is at the entry, now.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Shit!! We’d found him. We waited for him to
get upstairs and he got out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What shall we do?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I think.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Piddle. She smiles and looks for the
bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a
man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the
wall, without moving. She doesn’t dare passing before the open door
again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Why didn’t he close the window?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Because he didn’t get out!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: He’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: It’s cool departing this way… warm…
music…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: There are better things. You see the
importance of the “moment”. Ten minutes early or late, he’d have seen
death. He’d have suffered it. This way, he already departed. Without
knowing.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …I’d like knowing what he’s listening
to…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Later.</p>
<p><strong>another building - another day</strong>: Mathilda and Leon in
the corridor of a banal building. Leon offers a chewing-gum to Mathilda,
who accepts it. She’s listening to a walkman. Leon sweetly pulls the
headphones off her head.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: OK… I like it. It gives me the rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Excuse me, Mister… I’m looking for Mister
Rubens’ apartment, but it’s dark out here and I got lost…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …One second.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Come on, little stupid? Is it enough or want
some more! Then? Come on, show me your face! Come!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did you think you could get me by such an old
trick?! The gum trick, I played it before your birth, idiot! Come on,
show me your little fucking face! The gum trick! Huh! I go.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The ring trick? …Come on, little idiot! Show me
your famous trick. Come on, I’m waiting! Come!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …Shit.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: This is the ring trick.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s restaurant</strong>: About 4pm. Restaurant is desert,
apart from Dino, who’s keeping books at his usual table. An elegantly
dressed man gets inside. He’s forced to put away his sunglasses because
of the feeble interior light. He looks nervous. He sits in front of
Tony. He’s a little surprised.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Tell me, there’s nobody in the restaurant:
you’re not forced to sit at my table?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Rinaldi… Rinaldi… What region do you come
from?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Messina.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Emilio? Due grappe! …Why the hell did you come
here?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Rightly… I came here to recover.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: But… He works for your same employer?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t give a shit about. I
trade at left, at right and that’s dangerous in there…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s a little out of the world coming to visit
me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn’t the usual procedure…</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: I know… But I’m a little pressed.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Giancarlo… Rinaldi.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Is he still alive?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Yeah… And still in Messina. He’s my
uncle.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Huh? Are you Alfredo’s son, then?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: No… Dino’s.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: He’s dead, five years ago…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Have you ever been in Messina, son?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Yes… Twice.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Did you fish in Messina? The “pesce
spada”?</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: It’s a specialty down there. It’s a fishing
boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin,
a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: A lookout above, one below, two fishers and a
captain. A lot of people, for such a small boat like that. They depart
to the sea, sometimes for days, never sure they’ll get something.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: I think I will get back in Messina this
summer… It’s too long I haven’t been there.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You’re right, son. You must care the links
with your family, always. It’s the only important thing in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: …Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Salute.</p>
<p><strong>rinaldi</strong>: Salute.</p>
<p><strong>new apartment - decrepit</strong>: Leon prepares his tools.
Mathilda sits on the windowsill. Leon wears his overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, hadn’t you told that bullshit to the
receptionist, we’d still be in the hotel, I make you notice.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: That wasn’t bullshit, I said we love each
other.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah!… Anyway, I don’t like hotels. Too much
people, everyone’s got the key… I don’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I prefer apartments… Furthermore, there are
always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Friends? You’re crazy! In my building,
before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn’t get one, or they
just cared video games and you couldn’t get one, no more.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re darkening the picture, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: A little…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yeah… There’s a lot on TV.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, then watch television!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I won’t be long, Mathilda, OK?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s too big.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yeah… I’m just good for left-overs!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Risky business, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …You’re young, Mathilda… You still have a
chance to get out. You can’t give up this chance. You have to protect
it. There’s a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: There are just two things I’m interested
in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda… There’s equally a lot of other
things!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Huh, really? What? Come on, I’m
waiting!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Nothing, I tell you! Everything else reminds
me a big yogurt: warm and rancid.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, excuse me… It’s the yogurt that made me
laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: You’ve just to love me and I’ll be the
happiest woman around.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah, I know! But for the moment you’re not
yet a woman. So, be patient… I need time… And you too. You have to grow
up.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I don’t grow up any more. I just get
older.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I won’t be long. Two days at most,
promised.</p>
<p><strong>no more rain - sun rays over the city</strong>: Mathilda is
at a public phone.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Good day, Madam, may I talk with Jenny,
please?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: HEY!! But what did you do?! What happened??
It’s months you’ve disappeared. Everyone thinks you got killed, at
school, above all since some FBI guys got to school and asked a lot of
questions about you!</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Yeah, pal! And I didn’t say anything, I said
I don’t know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid
Raphaella?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: She told them you wanted her things and that
she wasn’t surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Asshole. But she won’t miss anything,
that. You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Good, what are you going to do? Do you come
back?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No… I can’t… I got tired. I want to live
my way.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know
him?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: I can’t believe it! “Yes I think”… How she
kids me! I can’t believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: Well… Did you sleep with him or not?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No… Not yet. He’s very shy… and very
sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>jenny</strong>: …Good… But what’s special in him?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …I don’t know… It’s true he touches me. I
love him.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’ll miss you, Jenny.</p>
<p><strong>tony’s restaurant</strong>: The old Tony at his usual table.
Three little boys in front of him. Their hands on their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Don’t peep, OK? Attention…</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You can look!</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: Happy birthday!</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You’d better talk good, son, because, for the
moment, I’ve got a quite bad opinion about you. Norman smiles.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: I respect your business, Mister Tony.
Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result. It’s
right this that makes me nervous, now. I hope you’ll excuse my temporary
bad mood?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Then…</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: Do you recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: …Even his mother wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: I’ve got an offer for you: you keep your

to do nothing aren’t bad, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind
of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear.
They’re lonely, worse than wolves.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: May we have this wolf’s name and
address?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: These guys have no place. They change
virtually everyday. And his name… It’s a surname.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: …Come on, I make you a favor. Tell me
which is the one you love least. I’ll kill him first.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You know, boy, I know their parents very well;
I think they won’t appreciate your sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: It’s good he had no family. Come on,
speak, now!</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: Else, I’ll have to ruin this
birthday.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: Thanks Tony. Justice will be grateful
for your precious collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: …Would you like me to call the police,
for this little incident?</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>new building</strong>: Mathilda sits at stairways’ end, in
front of a long corridor and a small court. Five kids, about
13-year-old, play baseball in the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: You’re the new one at 5th?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Shall we explain her everything, ok? This
will avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: You can’t sit here like that.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Huh? Why?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Because you have to pay. It’s like a
parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It’s the rule…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …And how much is it?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Ten dollars… A month.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Got the change for 100?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …It’s not serious… It means I’ll pay ten
months in advance.</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: …OK… Good.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Can I sit on the stairways now?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Huh… Yeah, yeah… Of course.</p>
<p><strong>a kid</strong>: …Would you like a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes… Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>the kid</strong>: A little draught?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No thanks… Never alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>later - in the court</strong>: The kids and Mathilda play
baseball. The ball gets to Mathilda. A little too fast: she avoids
it.</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: …Bitch! You’re really nil! Come on, get
away! Get back to your stairways!</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: You fear a ball?! I can’t believe it!!
Gals!… Come on, let’s play, not a game for gals!</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Good, let’s have a break, five minutes.
Poly? Cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Look, the fearful’s got a game for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …You can show me your balls! Russian
roulette, you know?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I live in here…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: No entry for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I live in here.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: When I say no entry, I mean “no entry”.</p>
<p><strong>in the apartment</strong>: A plain clothes detective sits in
front of Mathilda, who’s crying on her couch. Evidently, the cop’s
waiting for her to stop crying, for interrogation. He looks at his
wristwatch.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m here, I’ll never leave you again,
Mathilda, never. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I love you so much, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I love you too, and I don’t want to lose
you.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Can I have a word with you, Mister? Are you her
father?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Well… The kids. They didn’t want me to
play baseball. They said I’m a fearful gal.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Poor darling, and then?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Well… I proposed them to play roulette…
Like we played… …And I lost.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t cry, Mathilda, please. Take. Prepare
your case and we get away for a while, OK? We change neighborhoods! Come
on, go, I wait, OK?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come on, prepare your stuff, we move in a much
calmer place, you’ll see. Near the country.</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: …I’ve been following the guy for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>commander</strong>: May I know this typhoon’s name?</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: …Leon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes… Alright.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well… I don’t know, suddenly, the make up… All
this… How are you? Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Of course! I’m fine! I put on your
beautiful dress, I slightly made up… I tried to get beautiful! Don’t you
like it?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: So say it!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Don’t you drink?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I prefer waiting for a while… I feel it would
go the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …No…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Don’t you like me?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: You know, girls think about their first
boyfriend for a long time… I imagined him with grizzled hair, elegant… A
little like Georgia’s father. Georgia is a classmate of mine… Kinda guy
makes you feel sure! Cool, isn’t it? Leon nods yes, without really
knowing what he’s saying “yes” to. My mates told me the first time they
made love was awful. They had pain everywhere, afterward… But that’s
because they made it with men they didn’t love. In fact, they did it
just to show off, at the beginning. Later, they liked it. …Like
cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: How many girlfriends did you have?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Well… 1… 2… 10… 100… 1000? How many,
approximately?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Mathilda, I don’t feel like talking about
this.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Why? Did you have too many and you fear it
may shock me? I won’t get shocked. I’m used to this! My father was a
true pig. He fucked the bitch I’d as mother all around the apartment.
Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex
behind it! And my sister, if you didn’t sleep with her, you’re
building’s exception!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Stop, Mathilda! Don’t talk like that!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I talk because you don’t talk, Leon. I
declare my love and you say nothing. That’s why I’m nervous and I can’t
stop talking. Tell me you love me, or you don’t love me, or you love
someone else. ….But tell me something.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I had a girlfriend… A long time ago. Before
coming here, in my country. I was 14-year-old… We flirted like kids… Her
father didn’t want her to meet me. My family was not very
respectable.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Then? You didn’t give a shit about her
father, didn’t you? You met anyway?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …He killed her, a bullet in her head…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …That’s awful. I hope you killed, that
asshole?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed
him to make ten steps… No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By
telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my
father, who worked for Tony. …I was 17. Then, I never left the city… And
never had another girlfriend…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Leon, I don’t know life very much… I just
know I love you… And love is stronger than anything else.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Maybe… Sure… But… I’m scared, Mathilda.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Don’t fear, Leon. You mustn’t fear love,
when it’s this beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: …Because you deserve it, Leon…</p>
<p><strong>morning</strong>: A beautiful morning, like one wishes
everyone to be. Leon in the bed. It’s the first time one sees him in a
bed and, furthermore, he sleeps. By his side, on a small table, a gun.
You never know. On the other side, Mathilda looks at him, smiling,
because he’s almost nice while he sleeps. She starts moving to stand up.
Leon abruptly wakes up. His hand reaches for the gun. He sees Mathilda
and the room. Mathilda puts a hand on his chest and kindly forces him to
lay down.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Did you sleep well?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …I never really sleep.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Huh, yes? I forgot! …When you fake
sleeping, you’d better not snore!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Like a baby!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I go looking for some milk for breakfast…
I come back. …I love you, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You… You knock the code, when you come back,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Three times, then two times.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: May I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: What do you do, with the money you
earn?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Nothing, for the moment.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Maybe it’s the time to do something, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I don’t know… Getting far away, the two of
us, for example… And forgetting all this…</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I’m gonna buy a globe, you’ll see. Bronx
isn’t even marked, so much the rest is big. …Think…</p>
<p><strong>inside the building</strong>: Mathilda comes back with her
milk. She gets out of the lift and a hand covers her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Is he alone?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Does he expect you?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Have you got apartment’s keys?</p>
<p><strong>the boss</strong>: Is there a code, a way to knock the door
or something?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Don’t fear.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I have no fear.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shit! We need reinforcements! Maximum! Come
on!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t expose your back! Turn!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: Why did you unleash the pipe, I don’t
know?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It will take them five minutes! How long ago
did they arrive?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I don’t know… Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good! Snipers can’t be in position.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …Ten minutes at least… Not five.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: How shall we get out now, Leon?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Let me work. We’ll get out, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: But… Leon? You’ll never get in it! It’s
nearly too small for me!?</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No! I don’t want to leave you!!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Mathilda, listen!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: No, no! I don’t want to go! I don’t
want!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Listen to me, shit! We’ve got no chance to get
out together! Alone, I will get out! Trust me! I’m in perfect shape,
Mathilda, now! I slept well! I love you! I’m happy! And I thought! I’ll
get all the money Tony keeps for me and we’ll leave, OK? Together! We’ll
leave tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: You say it just to calm me!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it’s
true! You’ll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK?
We’ll go where you want! I swear, you’ll see, Mathilda!!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come on, go! Don’t let them find you! I finish
this work and we meet at Tony’s, OK? Spread your arms to do not fall too
fast. So, good. At Tony’s! One hour or two, OK? I love you,
Mathilda!</p>
<p><strong>mathilda</strong>: I love you too, my darling.</p>
<p><strong>apartment</strong>: A wounded cop, mask on his face, gets out
of the apartment and out of the smoke cloud.</p>
<p><strong>a boss</strong>: Get downstairs, guy, get down!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s deep. You’d better get down to the
ambulance, they’ll care you properly. A cop chief doesn’t recognize
Leon.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: 3rd district? …A mess up there, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Let him breathe five minutes!! Would you
like me to take you down?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Let me put my mask on. I breathe better with
it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yeah, right. Get down and wait for ten
minutes. I’ll get to check you, OK?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: OK.</p>
<p><strong>in the apartment</strong>: A cop’s checking out the
apartment, he pushes kitchen’s door and a grenade falls to his feet. The
explosion shakes the whole corridor. Cops crowd it. Below, Leon exploits
the moment to stand up and discreetly walk downstairs. Floor after floor
without problems.</p>
<p><strong>right hand</strong>: It’s alright! We got him! It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Shit! Never seen anything like this
before!</p>
<p><strong>another</strong>: He almost fucked me, furthermore!</p>
<p><strong>stansfield</strong>: He killed Richmond, my boss, two days
ago… And Rinaldi too! We’ve been on him for months.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Nice shot.</p>
