<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Agnes!… Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: I’m just going to put something here to
stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister. She’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Here they are now.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: Martha, it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What about Roger? He’s free.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: They want a woman.</p>
<p><strong>lyon</strong>: All you have to do is meet with her once or
twice… then tell the court she’s insane.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you dictating my position to me? We’re
getting into some sticky legal territories here.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Martha, all we’re saying is, no-one wants this
to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown… least of all me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Eve, she strangled a baby!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Nobody is interested in sending a nun to
prison.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: We’re not telling you what to decide Martha.
We’re not even telling you to take this.</p>
<p><strong>lyon</strong>: Is there any reason why you feel you shouldn’t
take it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Today’s my birthday. I always make bad
decisions on my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hi, it’s Helen, calling to tell you that
Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm her appointment at nine o’clock
tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: Hi Martha, it’s Roger. Can you call me at the
hospital. I’d like your opinion on a case. Oh, bye the way, happy
birthday. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hi, Marty it’s Helen again. I cancelled
your Wednesday afternoon appointment so you can visit with your mother.
Bye bye.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Bonjour, I’m Doctor Martha Livingston,
I…</p>
<p><strong>mother superior</strong>: Doctor Livingston I presume? I’m
Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn’t call Mother if you don’t wish. Most
people find it uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well… I…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’m afraid the word brings up the
most unpleasant connatations in this day and age…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes… I…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You can call me Sister.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: … Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You must have tons of questions. You
may smoke if you want to. Just don’t tell any of the Sisters.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You were a smoker?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Two packs a day.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I can beat that.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Unfiltered.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who knew about Agnes’ pregnancy?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: No-one.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How did she hide it from the other nuns?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She undressed alone… she bathed
alone.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Is that normal?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How did she hide it during the day?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She could have hidden a machine gun
in here if she had wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Didn’t she have any physical
examinations</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: We’re examined once a year. Her
pregnancy fell in between the doctor’s visits.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who was the father?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I haven’t a clue.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What man had access to her?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: None as far as I know.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Was there a priest?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes, but I…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Father Martineau, but I don’t see him
as a candidate.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Could there have been anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Obviously there was.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you didn’t try to find out who?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Believe me, I’ve done everything
possible short of asking Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why haven’t you asked her?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She can’t even remember the birth. Do
you think she’d admit to the conception?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Look, someone gave her the baby.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes, but that was some ten months
ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do
with this trial.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why do you think that?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Don’t ask me those questions dear,
I’m not the patient.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well I’m the doctor. I’m the one who’s going
to decide what is, or is not important here.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Look doctor, I don’t know how to tell
you this politely, but I don’t approve of you. Not you personally…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The science of psychiatry.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Exactly. I want you do deal with
Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won’t hold up under any
sort of cross examination.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I am not with the Inquisition.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: And I am not from the Middle Ages. I
know what you are! I don’t want that mind cut open.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hello. I’m Doctor Livingston. I’ve been
asked to talk to you. May I?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You have a lovely voice.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I just heard you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: That wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Was it Sister Marguerite?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hasn’t anyone ever told you that before?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Let’s talk about something else.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What would you like to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Anything… may I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: First thing that comes to your mind?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: God! But there’s nothing to say about
God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Second thing that comes to your mind.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Love.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Have you ever loved anyone?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, who in particular?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Right now?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, have you ever loved another man…
other than, Jesus Christ?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, there are so many.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well do you love… do you love Father
Martineau?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, yes!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you think he loves you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, I know he does.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: He’s told you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No. But… when I look into his eyes, I can
tell.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’ve been alone together?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Often?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: At least once a week.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you like that?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where do you meet?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: In the confessional.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau outside
the…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: You want to talk about the baby don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Would you like to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I never saw any baby… I think they made it
up.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why should they?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you remember the night they said it
came?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No. I was sick.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How were you sick?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Something I ate.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Down… there.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I went to my room.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I got sicker.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: In the middle of all the pain?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where did the baby come from?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: What baby?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The baby they made up.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: From their heads…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Is that where they say it came from… ?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No, they say it came from the waste paper
basket!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where’d it come from before that?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: From God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: After God… before the waste-paper
basket.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I… I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, how are babies born?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Don’t you know?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes I do, but I want you to…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t understand what you’re talking about…
you want to talk about the baby… everybody wants</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Then let’s talk about something else…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No… no, I’m tired of talking, I’ve been
talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything… nobody
listens to me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No… no, I don’t want to answer any more
questions.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Would you like to ask them?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Just that… you ask and I’ll answer.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: What’s your real name?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Martha Louise Livingston.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Would you like to be?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Not at the moment, no.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Do you have any children?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Would you like some?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I can’t have them any more.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’ve stopped menstruating</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Why do you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Does it bother you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No questions.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one
day I’ll become obsessed with something else, then I’ll stop smoking… Do
you have any more questions?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Where do you think babies come from?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: From their mothers and fathers of course.
Before that, I… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Well I think they come from… angel lights on
their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies
start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in
down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there.
I don’t know where good babies come out. And you can’t tell the
difference… except bad babies cry a lot… and they make their fathers go
away… and their mothers get very ill… die sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you know a Marie?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No… do you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Well… what do you think? Is she
totally bananas or merely slightly off centre… or maybe she’s perfectly
sane and just a very good liar.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What’s your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I believe Agnes is different.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: From other nuns… Yes I… I’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: From other people! I believe she is
not crazy, nor is she lying.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How could she have a baby and know nothing
of sex or birth?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Because she’s an innocent. She’s a
slate that’s hasn’t been touched except by God.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: In her case it isn’t. She’s had very
little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when
her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She’s never been out there
Doctor. She’s never seen a movie or a television show. She’s never even
read a book.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: If she’s so innocent, how come she murdered
a child?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She didn’t! This is manslaughter, not
murder. She didn’t consciously kill that baby. She’d lost a lot of
blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: So, someone else could have done it.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: No… not in the eyes of the
police.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And in your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’ve already told you what I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That she was unconscious, yes! So someone
easily could have come in the room and killed the…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You don’t really believe something
like that happened do you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s possible isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: One of the other nuns found out about the
baby and… and wanted to avoid a scandal.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s absurd!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That possibility never occurred to you?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: No-one knew about Agnes’ pregnancy.
No-one. Not even Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: You have been listening to Mostly Music
from Montreal. This is CBC Radio.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Is Father Martineau in please?</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Wipe your feet.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Pere Martineau… ???</p>
<p><strong>father martineau</strong>: They arise at five in the morning…
and they’re in bed by nine at night. Even if a man could get to them, he
would probably find them praying. That’s why I see that the real
question is not only how he got in, but when.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you’re the only man to see them?</p>
<p><strong>father martineau</strong>: I promise you Doctor, even if I
had the inclination, how could I possibly catch her? She would have to
be a very slow and patient nun. Ah no… they’re a very special and rare
people those Sisters. Only a few of them left in this modern world,
consecrated to the praise of God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hello, Mama … brought you something.</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: Shut up, I’m trying to watch this.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s your favourite…</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s Martha, Mama. There you go.</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: Marie brings me icecream too you know.
Chocolate… my favourite.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I thought cherry-vanilla was your
favourite.</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: Not any more… now I like chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you have a good week Mama. Are they
treating you all right?</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: You know Martha never comes to see me. You
watch it, she’s going straight to hell… after all the things she said to
me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman… has an
abortion. I knew that one wouldn’t work out. Not like you Marie. You got
married to God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Marie’s dead Mama.</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: I remember when you was a little girl Marie.
You come back from the movies and you’d say - Mama that ending was so
sad… and I’d tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a
vault in Hollywood. And you believed me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Mama, that wasn’t Marie, that was me!</p>
<p><strong>mama</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I… I’m Martha, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>sister anne</strong>: The convent was built for over fifty.
Not many of us left… just us and the chickens.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How do you survive?</p>
<p><strong>sister anne</strong>: Oh, we own the land around here. But we
rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some
vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well that’s a lot of land. You must have
help. Do you have field hands that help you?</p>
<p><strong>sister anne</strong>: No. We work the land alone. No-one but
Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sister Anne, which was Agnes’ room?</p>
<p><strong>sister anne</strong>: Oh that one there, in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The one up on the third floor?</p>
<p><strong>sister anne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: This convent is locked solid. The
only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn’t let Christ
in after dark.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, it’s been known to happen in the day
too. Maybe Agnes went to him.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh come on, you’ve talked to her. She
doesn’t even know how babies are born, let alone made.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: When did you first learn about her…
innocence, the way she thinks?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Shortly after she came to us.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you weren’t shocked?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I was appalled, just as you are
now.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She stopped eating completely…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: This was before her pregnancy?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: About two years before.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Agnes, it has come to my attention
that you have stopped eating. Why is this?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’ve been commanded by God.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: He talked to you Himself?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Through someone else?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She’d punish me.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: One of the other Sisters?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because I’m getting fat.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, for Heaven’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I am, there’s too much flesh on me.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m a blimp.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why does it matter whether you’re fat
or not…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: … You needn’t worry about being
attractive here.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I do, I have to be attractive to God.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: He loves you the way you are.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No he doesn’t. He hates fat people.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who told you this?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It’s a sin to be fat.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Look at the statues, they’re thin.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: That’s because they’re suffering… suffering
is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who tells you these things?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer
the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s not what he meant.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I… I am a little child but my body keeps
getting bigger and soon I… I won’t be able to fit in, I… I won’t be able
to squeeze into Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place
where…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No… I mean… I mean look at these. I’ve got to
lose weight, I’m a blimp.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh my dear child.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: God blew up the Hindenburg. He’ll blow me up,
that’s what she said…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Mommy I’ll get bigger and bigger every day
and then I’ll pop but… but if I stay little it won’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Your mother tells you this?… Agnes
your mother is dead.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: But she watches… she listens.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Nonsense, I’m your mother now and I
want you to eat.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No I don’t… the host is enough.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: My dear, I don’t think a communion
wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Of God.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes, of God.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m being punished.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Dear Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It started this morning and I can’t get it to
stop.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why didn’t you take her to a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: It was healed by the following
morning and she started eating again…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She had a… a hole in the palm of her hand!
She could have bled to death.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She has it now.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I know what you’re thinking, she’s a
hysteric pure and simple.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Not simple, no.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I saw it. Clean through the palm of
her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s being doing it for centuries. She’s not
unique, she’s just another victim.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: God’s victim. That’s her innocence.
She belongs to God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And I intend to take her away from Him.
That’s what you’re afraid of isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You bet I am.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Here you are. Don’t let anyone know where you
got them.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Last Tuesday, I didn’t eat all of my lima
beans… hid them under my spoon.</p>
<p><strong>father martineau</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I thought… thoughts… about…</p>
<p><strong>father martineau</strong>: Speak up, I can hardly hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I thought ugly thoughts about Sister
Marguerite.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: Would you tell me why the hell this is
taking so long.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Look there are a lot of unanswered questions
here.</p>
<p><strong>lyon</strong>: Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to heal
and play detective. Who do you think you are?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I know my job. Don’t tell me my job Lyon. My
duty as a doctor is to…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Martha, you have to make a decision on her
sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of
law.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No… no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see
fit.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The longer you take to make a decision, the
more difficult it will be for us.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The bishop is breathing down our necks.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And the sooner she goes to prison, the
better off she’ll be?</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t believe this. I don’t bloody believe
this.</p>
<p><strong>lyon</strong>: Well the bishop will be very upset about
this.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’m fighting for this woman’s life, not some
bloody bishop.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You liked Sister Paul?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She was kind to me. She told me I was
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What else did she tell you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She said all of God’s angels would want to
sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where’s that?… I promise I won’t tell, would
you take me?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she
climb up here often?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No, only when she felt like it. She brought
me up here last winter and the next day she died.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No wonder… wait… Agnes… Agnes how do you
feel about babies?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, they frighten me, I’m afraid I’ll drop
them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they
land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that’s
why I don’t understand things.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Numbers… you can spend your whole life
counting and never reach the end.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t understand them either. Do you
suppose I was dropped on my head?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I hope not. It’s a terrible thing to be
dropped on your head.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, I’ve got to give up smoking. Agnes …
wait a minute… Agnes slow down.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She said you could see the whole world from
up here. But it looks much better far away than it looks close up.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: And sometimes I get under here… it makes a
wonderful sound.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What happens if the bell rings and you’re
under there?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Oh, it’s even more wonderful then.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s like hiding from my mother when I was a
little girl.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes…
have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No. There is nothing else. Just being here at
night helps me sleep.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You have trouble sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I get headaches. Mommy did too… oh, but she
wasn’t stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She knew what was going to happen to me.
That’s why she hid me away.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How did she know that?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Somebody told her.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: You’ll laugh.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I promise I won’t laugh. Who told her?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: An angel, when she was having one of her
headaches.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did your mother see angels often?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you believe she really saw them?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No, but I can never tell her that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why not? Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She’d get angry.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, did you love your mother?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you ever want to be a mother
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I could never be a mother.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Well I don’t think I’m old enough and besides
I don’t want to have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because I don’t want one.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: If you did want one, how’d you go about
getting one?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: From someone who didn’t want to have a
baby.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Like you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How would that person get one if they didn’t
want one?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: A mistake…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, how did your mother get you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: A mistake… it was a mistake…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: If you’re trying to get me to say that she
was a bad woman and hated me and didn’t want me but that’s not true, she
was a good woman, a saint…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, I don’t believe you know nothing
about sex…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I can’t help it if I’m stupid.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: … that you don’t remember getting
pregnant…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Not my fault.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: … and that you don’t believe you carried a
child.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What the child?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Everything… I don’t have children.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Don’t touch me like that! You don’t touch me
like that, I know what you want from me, you want to take God away. You
should be ashamed, they should lock you up people like you.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You hate us don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Nuns… you hate nuns.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I hate ignorance and stupidity.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: The Catholic Church…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I haven’t said anything against the the
Catholic Church.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Catholicism is not on trial here. I
want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn
this case over to someone else…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How dare you tell me to run my affairs!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: It’s my affair too.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How dare you think I’m in a position to be
pressured…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’m only interested…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: … or bullied or what ever you’re doing. Who
the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for
the way you treated this child.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She is not a child.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And she has a right to know that there’s a
world out there filled with people who don’t believe in God…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: ??? … virginity, right Mother? Poverty,
chastity and ignorance is what you live by.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was
married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have
grandchildren… surprised? It might please you to know that I was a
failure as a wife and mother. My children won’t even see me any more,
that’s their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I’ve passed
on. And don’t tell me I’m making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Then help her.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I am…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No, you’re shielding her. Let her face the
world.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: What good would it do. No matter what
you decide it’s either the… the prison or the nut house and the
differences between them are pretty thin.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: There’s another choice.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Aquittal.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge
would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: All right, what do you need.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Answers.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: When would Agnes have conceived the
child?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, some time in January.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you remember anything unusual happening
at the time?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Earthquakes?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Visitors to the convent.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you have a… a diary or a day book?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Take at look at it.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, Dear God…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: The sheets…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What sheets?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, Dear God, I should have
guessed…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: … I should have suspected
something.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Sister Marguerite says you have been
sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: In the medieval days the nuns and monks would
sleep in their own coffins.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: We’re not in the Middle Ages,
Sister.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It made them holy.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: It made them uncomfortable. And
if</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Then tell me. Where are your
sheets?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I burnt them.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: They were stained.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: How many times have I burned into
your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that
menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed
of.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes, Mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Mean it!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: A few years ago one of the Sisters
came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old
to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had
been reminded of that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It’s not that… it’s not that…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It’s not my time of month.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Should you see a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t know what happened
Mother, I woke up… there was blood on the sheets, but I don’t know what
happened. I don’t know what I did wrong, I don’t know and I should be
punished.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That was the beginning, the night of
the conception. That’s why she burnt the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>sister</strong>: PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there
and many of the other nuns singing hymns.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: The twenty third of January. On that
night one of our elder nuns passed away.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sister Paul?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes. I don’t remember where Agnes
was. I was needed in the sick room.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Well you’re probably right about that. It
certainly can’t help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued
for any length of time.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why do you call it an investigation? I never
have.</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Your mother was a resident of Saint
Catherines home before you moved her.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What does this have to do with..?</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: And you had a sister who died in the
convent.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who told you this?</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Do you still go to church?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What business is it of yours..?</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Oh, we just wonder if you can be very
objective about this case.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Look, Father, ah… just because I don’t
subscribe to the… to the beliefs you subscribe to…</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: But what you believe makes no difference
to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t understand. Are you expecting me
to..?</p>
<p><strong>monsignor</strong>: Well somone’s got to suffer for this
Doctor. You’ve got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, I’m here because I want to help
you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m not sick.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But you’re troubled… aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: That’s because you keep reminding me. If you
go away then I’ll forget.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you’re unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Everyone’s unhappy, you’re unhappy aren’t</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Answer me! You never answer me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sometimes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Only you think you’re lucky because you
didn’t have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that
maybe weren’t always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad,
not her.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m always bad.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I breathed!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If
you can’t answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did… did she hit
you? Did she make you do something you didn’t want to? Did it make you
feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it… did it hurt
you? What did she make you you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She’s dead isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She can’t hurt you any more.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She can.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She watches… she listens.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, I don’t believe that. Tell me. I’ll
protect you from her.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: … makes me…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: … take off my clothes and then… she makes fun
of me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She tells you you’re ugly?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And that you’re stupid?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That you’re a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She says my whole body’s a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because she says if I don’t watch out I’ll
have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How does she know that?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Her headaches.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: And then…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She touches me down there with a cigarette.
Please Mommy, don’t touch me like that any more. I’ll be good, I won’t
be a baby any more.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do
something. I want you to pretend that I’m your mother. Oh yes, only this
time I want you to tell me what you’re feeling, alright?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Please! I want to help you. Let me help
you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, you’re ugly!… what do you say? Of
course you do. Agnes, you’re ugly!… what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you pretty?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, you’re stupid.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you intelligent?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m not mistake, I’m here aren’t I. How can I
be a mistake if I’m really here. God doesn’t make mistakes, you’re a
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it’s alright, it’s
alright, it’s alright, it’s alright, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Do you really love me or are you just saying
that?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I really love you.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: As much as Mother Miriam does?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: As much as God loves you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes? Who? Mother Superior?</p>
<p><strong>elderly nun</strong>: ???</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elderly nun</strong>: Look into the convent records.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sister…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, Good afternoon Sister, I… I’m looking
for some biographical data on Sister Agnes, and Mother said I might find
it here.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You lied to me</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Your niece!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I didn’t tell you because I didn’t
think it was important.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No, it just makes you doubly</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I never saw Agnes until she set foot
in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her.
And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me
if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And Agnes’ father?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: It could have been any one of a dozen
men from what my sister told me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Like keeping her home from school?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Listening to angels?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She drank too much. That’s what
killed her.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you know what she did to her?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I don’t think I care to know.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She molested her!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, dear God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: There is more here than meets the eye isn’t
there? Lots of dirty little secrets.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh God, if only I’d known.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why didn’t you? You knew she was keeping her
home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I knew that after the fact.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why didn’t you do anything to stop her?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Because I didn’t know…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Larry…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Marty, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Larry there’s got to be something
missing.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do
you want?</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What? You think that the girl is
innocent?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You got to be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Larry…</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: What’s the matter with you, you’ve seen the
reports. It’s a cut and dried case.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Maybe there’s something that’s not in the
report that should be.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: You’re too involved Marty. Jesus look at you.
Why don’t you turn this case over to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: If I find anything I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Hi Marty, it’s Helen. Mrs Davenport</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hallo, Doctor Livingston. My name is . I’m
doing a Sunday article on Sister Agnes for the Gazette. I would
appreciate it if you would give me a phone call on 942-2424.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: Hi Marty, it’s me. Listen I just talked with
Detective Crawley who was at the convent. She said that there was one
thing that bothered her that didn’t make it into the report. The waste
paper basket. The one in Agnes’ room. None of the other nuns had one.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>larry</strong>: … her that didn’t make it into the report.
The waste paper basket. The one in Agnes’ room. None of the other nuns
had one. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’ve gotten the court’s permission to
hypnotise her.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: And my permission?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’d like yours too.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: We’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Don’t deny it!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I haven’t decided yet.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The woman’s health is at stake.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Her spiritual health.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I don’t give a damn about her spiritual
health.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I know you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Sentence her and be done with it, that’s
what you’re saying and I…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: An unhappy woman…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She’s happy with us and she could go
on being happy if she was left alone.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Then why did you call the police in the
first place Mother, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Because I am a moral person.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Bullshit yourself!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Catholic Church doesn’t have a corner on
morality…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who said anything about the Catholic
Church…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You just said…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: What the hell has the Catholic Church
got to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Nothing…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: What have we done to hurt you? And
don’t deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?
Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when
the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today.
So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a
car when you were fifteen and you couldn’t because it was a sin?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It wasn’t sex. It was a lot of things, but
it wasn’t sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was
run</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Stupid woman… and that’s all?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That’s all? That’s enough! She was a
beautiful little girl.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: And what has that to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I wasn’t. I wasn’t. She was the pretty one.
She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I
was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know
what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot
Livingston.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: So you left the Church because you
had freckles?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No, because I… yeah, yeah I left the Church
cause I had freckles.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: When I was a child I used to hear my
guardian angel. She sang to me ’till I was six years old. That’s when I
stopped listening. But I remember the voice. A few years ago I looked at
myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. Not even of
Heaven. Not even of God. And then one evening I saw Agnes standing
by</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: My sister died in a convent. And it’s her
voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: No, it reminds me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Would you like one? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’d love one.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’m out of prac… … practice.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: All right?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Fine thanks…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you suppose the saints would have smoked
if tobacco had been popular back then?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of
course but, well Saint Thomas More…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Long, thin and filtered.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and
stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. And of course</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hand rolled.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Even Christ would partake
socially.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Saint Peter?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Pipe!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Mary Magdelen?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, you’ve come a long way baby.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: And Saint John would chew
tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Right. What do you suppose today’s saints
are smoking?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: There are no saints today. Good
people yes, but extraordinarily good people… those I’m afraid we are
sorely lacking.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you think they ever existed?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you want to become one?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Become? One is born a saint.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well you can try, can’t you, to be good?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes, but goodness has very little to
do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a
little crazy. But… they were still attached to God. Agnes has that
birth.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you think Agnes is still attached to
God?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Listen to her singing.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’d like to begin.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Begin what?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Would it stop you if I did?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: May I be present?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Then let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re listening to a chorus of angels. The
music surrounds you like a… warm and, comfortable pool of water. And
while you’re sleeping, you’re going to be able to recall, all the things
that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my
hands, you’ll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Doctor Livingston.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: To help me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Good. Would you like to tell me why you’re
here?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because I’m in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble
Agnes?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m frightened.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Of telling you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But it’s easy. It’s just a breath with
sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I had a baby.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How did you have a baby?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It came out of me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you know what was going to come</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you want it to come out?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because I was afraid.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why were you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Because I wasn’t worthy.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: To be a mother?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: May I open my eyes now?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How
did the baby get into you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It grew.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What made it grow? Do you know?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Would you like to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did anyone else know about the baby?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Will she be angry?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She made me promise not to.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who? Who made you promise? It’s alright
Agnes. It’s alright. Let’s go to your room. It’s the night about six
weeks ago when you were very sick.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh don’t be, I’m here. It’s alright. I want
you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I ate.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Fish… … brussel sprouts.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You don’t like brussel sprouts?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I hate them.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: We went to chapel for vespers.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Hm hmm.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I left early because I wasn’t feeling very
well.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Someone’s following me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Sister Marguerite I think.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the
baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that
night.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: My bed.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: A crucifix.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Above the bed? Any… anything else? What do
you you see, something different? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: A wastepaper basket.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you know who put it there?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What do you think it’s there for?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: For me to get sick in.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you ill?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I feel as if I’ve eaten glass.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I have to throw up…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t know which one</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Of me. Oh… God! My God… Water… it’s all
water…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why isn’t anyone coming?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: They can’t hear me that’s why. Oh God… I
don’t wanna…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Stop her!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Go away, I don’t want you here.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Is someone in the room with you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No… don’t hit me please…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Stop this, she’ll hurt herself I’m
not going to allow this.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: NO… no… I said leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Alright Agnes… it’s alright. One, two three…
It’s alright… it’s me, Doctor Livingston, it’s alright, alright.
Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Frightened.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Do you remember what just happened?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That’s good. Do you feel well enough to
stand?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: There you go. It’s alright, it’s alright,
it’s all over. It’s alright Agnes, that’s right, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh… very interesting I guess… Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That’s how he got in… or she got out.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh excuse me, what did you say?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Nothing. May I take some notes?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Oh yes,</p>
<p><strong>office girl</strong>: checks her lipstick in the reflective
metal walls. The lift Sisters get off.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Is the Doctor in her office?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Ah, who shall I say is calling?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: General MacArthur.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just a minute please, you can’t go in
there.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It’s… it’s alright Helen, just close the
door.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’ve just met with the bishop. We’re
taking you off the case.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: If we want to hire a psychiatrist for
Agnes. we’ll find our own, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: One that will ask the questions you want
asked.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: One that will approach this matter
with some objectivity and respect.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: For the Church?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: For Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You think she’s a saint?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She’s been touched by God, yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and
bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn’t be
touched. Give me a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: The father!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why must he be anybody?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: My God, you’re as crazy as…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Stop laughing, I don’t say it’s the
truth, I’m saying…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How ?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well give me a reasonable explanation</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: A miracle is an event without an
explanation. If she’s capable of putting a hole in her hand without
benefit of a nail, why couldn’t she split a cell in her womb?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: This is insane.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: There as no man in the convent on
that night and no way for any man to get in or out.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You’re saying God did it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But how did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: You’ll never find the answer for
everything God did.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I thought you didn’t believe in miracles
today Mother?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: But I want the opportunity to
believe. I want the choice to believe.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But what you are choosing to believe is a
lie because you won’t face the fact that she was raped… or seduced… or
that she did the seducing.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She is an innocent.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything
that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two,
three, right down the line.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s what you believe she is? The
sum of her psychological parts?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: That’s what I have to believe…</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Then why are you so obsessed with
her? You’re losing sleep over her? You’re thinking about her all the
time. You’re bent on saving her. Why?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: There’s a tunnel out of the crypt into the
barn. Did you know about that? There’s an answer Mother. That’s how she
got out.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s crazy. How could she find out
about it?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Somebody told her.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Who? That tun… that tunnel hasn’t
been used in fifty years.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh, would you stop lying Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why would I lie?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Because it’s murder we’re talking about.
Aren’t you concerned about what she told us about the other person in
her room.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I’m concerned about her health.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who was that person Mother? Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: If you believe this is murder, it is
the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not
Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: All I want is one more week.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: Why? You’ve done nothing to show any
progress.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes, that’s because I’m getting to her.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: You’re getting to all of us Martha, let’s
face it.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’ll have a decision by next week.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: It’s gone on long enough. You’re out.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh Joe… Joe she didn’t kill the baby.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: You have proof?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’ll have it.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Next week.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: No, no, no…</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Tomorrow… tomorrow, I’ll get it by tomorrow.
I will.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: Yes, demain</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: This is permission to take her
apart.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Hasn’t she had enough?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I have a few more questions to ask her.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: My God, but you’re determined.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who knew she was pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Why do you insist upon pressing…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Is it because she’s a nun?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Did you know she was pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And you didn’t send her to a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I didn’t guess until it was too
late.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: For what? An abortion?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Too late for what?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I don’t know… too late to stop
it.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: The baby?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: The scandal…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You went to the room to help with the
birth.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She didn’t want any help.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You hid the wastepaper basket in her
room.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I didn’t hide it. I put it there for
the blood and the dirty sheets.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And the baby.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You tied the cord around its neck.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I wanted her to have it when no-one
else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left
it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood
and I panicked.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Before or after you killed the child?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: I left it with her and I went for
help.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I doubt that’s what she’d say.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Then she’s a liar.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I want you to remember if you can a night
last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She said Michael.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What did she mean?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: The statue. She had shown it to me the day
before.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And the passage to the barn?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: So I could go to him.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How did she know about him?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She’d seen him too.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: From the belltower the day she before she
died.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: So she sent you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you frightened?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Hallo…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: … where are you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Is it you?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Halos…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: … dividing and dividing feathers and starts,
falling, falling into the iris of God’s eye. Oh… oh!… it’s… it’s so
lovely… it’s so… blue… yellow… blood wings, brown, blood…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: His blood… my God…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It’s bleeding… I’m bleeding… my God it won’t
stop, I can’t get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes… Agnes…</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Stay away from me…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of
God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: He frightened you and he hurt you. It’s not
your fault. It’s his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop
him from doing this to other women.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Not your fault…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes who did you see?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I hate him…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Of course you do. Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I hate him for what he did to me.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: For what he made me go through.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, who did this to you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: God! It was God. And now I’ll burn in hell
because I hate him.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes you won’t burn in hell. It’s alright
to hate him.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Agnes, what happened to the baby?</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: She can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What happened to the baby?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: It was dead.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: It was alive wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>mother miriam</strong>: Oh, don’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Wasn’t it!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Mother Miriam was with you wasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: She took the baby in her arms?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: You saw it all didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: And then… what did she do? Agnes what did
she do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: She… left me alone with that little thing,
and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it’s my
mistake, not Mommy’s. God’s mistake.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I put her to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: H… how?</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I tied the cord around her neck… wrapped her
in the bloody sheets… and stuffed her in the trash can.</p>
<p><strong>leveau</strong>: In view of the situation as it now stands,
and the testimony given here this morning, it seems quite clear that the
defendant was in no manner responsible for her actions. It is therefore
the judgement of this court that she be returned to the convent of Marie
Madeleine where she will be cared for under proper medical supervision
by a visiting physician.</p>
<p><strong>agnes</strong>: I stood in the window of my room every night
for a week. And one night I heard the most beautiful voice imaginable.
And when I looked I saw the moon shining down on him. For six nights he
sang to me, songs I’d never heard. And on the seventh night he opened
his wings and lay on top of me. All the while he sang - Charlie Sweet…
