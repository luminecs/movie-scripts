<h1 id="book-of-shadowsblair-witch-2">book-of-shadows–blair-witch-2</h1>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m…scared…to close my eyes–</p>
<p><strong>heather donahue</strong>: –I’m scared to open them. We’re
going to die out here–</p>
<p><strong>deborah roberts</strong>: –she’d be a much happier camper if
she’d lived to see this weekend’s grosses–</p>
<p><strong>deborah roberts</strong>: In only its first week of wide
release, “The Blair Witch Project” has taken in a whopping 36 million at
the nation’s box office. Not too bad for an independent film that was
reportedly made for less than the cost of your average Buick–</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: –lines to see the new film stretching
five blocks long down Houston Street–and this was for a 10 a.m.
show–</p>
<p><strong>young man #1</strong>: –to get the holy sh– –scared outta me,
man, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>young man #2</strong>: I heard last night they had people
runnin’ screamin’ out of the theatre–</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: …the kid…Mike…he was turned around
towards the wall ’cause that’s what that guy in 1940 made all the little
kids do before he killed them–</p>
<p><strong>teenager</strong>: Just a movie, baby!</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: ….no…it was real, what we saw ….wasn’t
it?–</p>
<p><strong>mary hart</strong>: –whatever you want to call it, “Blair
Watch” is definitely the Cinderella story of the summer, if not the
century, with now an 80 million dollar gross in just two weeks–</p>
<p><strong>30ish guy</strong>: –save your money, it’s all bullshit hype!
Blair Witch sucks!–</p>
<p><strong>stoner</strong>: –all repeat business, dude–I know morons
who’ve seen the stupid thing like three times in one day.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: How many times have you seen the
film?</p>
<p><strong>stoner</strong>: Like maybe five. But not in one -ing
day–</p>
<p><strong>maltin</strong>: –it taps into our universal primal fears: of
the boogeyman, of the things that go bump in the night– there’s
something out there, you can’t see it, and it’s coming for you–</p>
<p><strong>young man #1</strong>: –I’ll tell you what was scary: trying
to keep my lunch down. If that stupid camera jiggled one more time–</p>
<p><strong>young man #2</strong>: –some guy the row in front of me
actually did toss–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: –it was just so real–</p>
<p><strong>geeky guy</strong>: –it was real–</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: –you gotta be kidding me– there’s
people out there think “Blair Witch” was real??–</p>
<p><strong>man in suit</strong>: –the story of the three students was
fiction. The legend of the Blair Witch is, apparently, true,
however–</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: –the brass tacks of the matter is,
love it or hate it, “Blair Witch” has escalated from being merely
another cinema success story to a genuine nationwide phenomenon–if not
obsession. Profits from merchandising tie- ins going through the
roof–</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: –the official “Blair Witch” web- site
now having received 75 million “hits” to date–</p>
<p><strong>diane sawyer</strong>: –with that web-site, in just a matter
of a few weeks, begatting dozens more web-sites, with chat rooms so
packed with fans and foes you’re lucky to get a cyber-word in
edge-wise–</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: –the truth is, this movie’s probably been
the best and worst thing ever happen to this town. The good thing–well,
take a look down East Main there–</p>
<p><strong>sherif</strong>: –we’ve got people pouring in here like it’s
Times Square, some of ’em all the way from Europe, Japan. A whole lot of
money being spent. The bad?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: There used to be a sign on it, “Welcome to
Burkittsville.” They showed it in the movie. Somebody wanna show me
where it is now? I swear to God, these people, they’re coming in and
making off with every- thing isn’t nailed down. There’s two other signs
I had to take down myself, put away for safekeeping ’til this whole damn
thing’s finally over.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: When did you think that’ll be?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Just pray we get to see it this
lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Can’t seem to find ’em.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: Gotta be around here somewhere– right here’s
where Heather stood in the movie.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: We’re trying to find the graves of those
seven kids Rustin Parr killed.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: Lotta dead kids–just can’t find any died
later than like 1867.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: What do you think all these candles are
for?</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: I wouldn’t touch ’em.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Nothing much we can do–just enforce the
curfew. Which is dusk, for both the cemetery and the Black Hills
Forest.</p>
<p><strong>teen #1</strong>: This is what you call “striking gold.”</p>
<p><strong>teen #2</strong>: Fifty bucks a pop minimum back in
Philly.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: There seems to be some controversy
whether or not any of this actually happened.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That what actually happened.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: The three kids who disappeared,
everything that was in the movie, the whole Blair Witch legend.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You’ll excuse me–</p>
<p><strong>artisan executive</strong>: –the only statement we feel
comfortable making at this time is: we’re happy the film’s been such a
success; we grieve with the families of Heather, Josh and Mike. Now, if
you’ll excuse me–</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: –this is the only reality I know: we’re
averaging about four lost rubberneckers a week up in these woods.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Get outta these damn woods and go home!
There is nothing in there!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You want to turn that shit down just a
hair??</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Shit? This is from “Josh’s Blair Witch Mix,”
man!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Down or off–you’re giving me a migraine.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just trying to set the mood for the
mission–get the “feeling.”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Only thing I’m feeling is homicidal.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hold this.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: The wheel.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: The bitched-out babe in back here is one
Anna Tassio–we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room,
we all did–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –Christ almighty–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –but she was nicer then–sweeter– she hadn’t
vomited twice already like today–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –it’s called “morning sickness,” asshole–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –a six week bun in the oven–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –Cotter, just turn the camera off?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend,
Nick Leavitt–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –turn the camera off–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –they’re from UMass, doing some kind of
fucking term paper–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –Graduate Thesis–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –about the Witch–</p>
<p><strong>voice from back seat</strong>: –she doesn’t exist–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –you got that right–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –and if she ever did–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –which she may have–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –bullshit–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –she wasn’t a witch–we embrace nature, not
evil–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –thank you, Heather Arendt–and arend’t we
glad you’re here–a real witch–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –fuckin’ A right–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –Cotter–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –a Wiccan–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –turn the goddamn camera off!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re not making Blair Witch II here.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: And let it be known–before we even get to
Burkittsville–it’s gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie–for
half the cost–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –which’d be about ten bucks–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –and unlike the first one, every second of
it’s gonna be true! “Blair Witch: The Real Story!”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Cotter?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I’m not finished.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re all going to be if you don’t hit the
brakes.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Jee-zuz!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re a complete fucking idiot, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was
s’posed to be driving!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You drive, I’ll handle the video, okay?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Bye-bye–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This isn’t about us.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Right. And the check’s in the mail.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Cheery little place.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s like traveling back in time.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows
over a burning witch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They never burned witches in this country,
they hanged them.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Whatever–all I know is the persecution’s
going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory
bullshit like this fucking movie–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –hey: check that out!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: ’Thought those all got stolen.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Guess they thought it was safe to put some up
again.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Think again.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Somebody wanna hand me that claw hammer in
back–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Get busted on your own time. We’ve got a
schedule to keep.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly
you got your ass kicked as a kid?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a
stop: there on the left.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Why are we here?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we
should meet her.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Whatzername–the “psychic” Anna hired.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Domini. Domini Von Teer.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What’s she look like?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No idea, just talked to her on the ’Net–she’s
very good.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: So says her website.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: She <u>is</u>–she’s helped solve a bunch of
murders: Arizona, New Mexico–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –how old?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I dunno, probably right up there, based on her
resume.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Then there she blows.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Terrific–and I was afraid I wasn’t going to
get laid on this trip.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s not whatzername–it’s Mary Brown.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park
Bible Psycho?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were
real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –whatever; that’s her.</p>
<p><strong>mary brown</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just came over to say hello.</p>
<p><strong>mary brown</strong>: It’s five bucks for signin’ something;
ten for signin’ a Bible; twenty, you want to take a picture with me. Any
kind’ve conversation, that’s subject to negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I don’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Thanks just the same. I think we’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>mary brown</strong>: Heather’s not.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mary brown</strong>: Heather. I saw her. Elly Kedward’s hands
were on her throat, and she was sucking out the girl’s insides with her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Heather from the movie.</p>
<p><strong>mary brown</strong>: Heather.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Been a pleasure meeting you; we need to
<u>go</u> now.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I take it back–she <u>wasn’t</u> an actor.
She’s a nutjob.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: That’s what Josh and Mike said.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Shut-up.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Domino? Domini Von Teer…??</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Present.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Domini?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’re you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Trying to find the energy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Inside the grave?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: To stand up–I’m exhausted. Been on the road
since yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: You want a hand?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I want amphetamines.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Beer and weed is what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Both. Now.</p>
<p><strong>boy kurth</strong>: May 28 ’00 </b> HEATHER Sweet place to
take a nap.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Strange girl.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: So, I hear you’re from New Mexico!</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Her father’s Sheriff of Taos County.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Sometimes. Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Guy who killed all the kids in the ’40s.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: “The Voiiiiices made him do it.”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The Witch’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: She <u>wasn’t</u> a witch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I hear voices all the time.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: What is all this shit?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the
places where there’ve been alleged Blair Witch “sightings” –the Parr
House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: See what turns up–which I guarantee will be
nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –or incredibly fucking naive.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hey, folklore–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –<u>myth</u>–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –doesn’t just pop out of thin air. It spins
off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –or one huge attack of group hysteria.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Either way, maybe there’s a book in it, and
they both make a ton of money.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a <u>serious</u> sociological study.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: The four of you really have too much spare
fucking time on your hands, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: And what’s your excuse for being here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She got <u>paid</u>.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I thought the movie was bitchin’.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Wait a sec!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He really is a fucking idiot.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Didn’t we already <u>do</u> this hill?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Terrific: an hour, we’re already lost–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Cotter?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Okay, but–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –now there.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Oh. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Where they found the backpacks and all the
film a year later.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil,
ash, and compost layers.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Yeah, that was a cluster-fuck for the
mind.</p>
<p><strong>nick/heather</strong>: If it happened at all.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Mike! Miiiiiiike! Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re not only an idiot, you’re a goddamn
<u>child</u>.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Why does everyone here but me have have a
gigantic stick up their ass?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Hey! Check this out!</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Look at those marks–just like in the
movie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ancient runes–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –what the fuck’s a “rune”?–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –chalked just hours ago by ancient
adolescents. It’s called vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What is <u>this</u>?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Oak?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. What’s it doing here in the middle of the
foundation?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Growing. This place burnt down 50 years
ago. Trees happen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look it’s right here–from the Blair Witch
“Dossier”–the sketch the anthropology students made of their dig when
they found the backpack.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s a sapling–<u>this</u> mother’s got to
be three hundred years old, minimum.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s a <u>sketch</u>, Anna–it’s not to- scale
cartography; the tree was not the kids’ focus–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –do you <u>agree</u> it’s that <u>old</u>,
Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay, fine, whatever, yes–it’s an <u>old</u>
tree.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Why don’t you just cut it down and count
the goddamn rings–who <u>cares</u>?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Because it means the tree is older than the
house.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So whoever built this–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –brother of Rustin Parr’s maternal
grandfather, somewhere after 1858–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –<u>whoever</u>–they built an entire house
<u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room.
Somebody like to explain that to me?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty
Parr.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, <u>c’mon</u>–even you have to admit this
is weird.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No–<u>this</u> is weird.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –sacred and occult Scotch Tape.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Rusty Parr had the right idea on child
care.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your parents didn’t have a <u>bigger</u>
one?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It was <u>free</u>–I recall that was the chief
selling point for you.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know, Nick, you’ve been something of a
total asshole the past few days.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Pardon me, I’ve had a few things on my
mind–like putting this safari together.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Like how weirded-out you are with this
pregnancy thing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s just leave it at: it was one hell of a
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You don’t want it though.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Your body, your call.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why is there no “our” here?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Could we take this up later–like indoors,
without half the world listening?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You feel no need to get married or
anything.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Anna–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –fine, later, fine.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Sonovabitch!!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nice tent.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hadn’t even opened the thing since Cub
scouts.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Never would’ve guessed.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: So where the hell am I going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: If you’re looking at me, look
elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I’ve got the Panasonic Portable DVD
player.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What movies?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Ask me what I don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What I never could figure about the
movie?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Three people: two guys, a girl– sleeping in
the same motel room, the same tent night after night.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No fucking.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Made no sense. Scared out of their minds,
and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips.
Nada.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No sense at all. I’m a little stressed.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Try a long walk.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Oooh. Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Ah, Domini?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You planning on sleeping out there?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Not planning on sleeping at all.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Oooh. Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I figure I lie here long enough, maybe he’ll
swoop down and carry me off in his talons.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We should be so lucky.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Butt-ugly owl.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …see if it’s alive–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –shit–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who’s James?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You said the name “James.”</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Baby names?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know. Nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You want me to scooch over next to you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: This place is like a regular K-mart of bad
vibes, ain’t it, pal?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Please, someone, help me–</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: –somebody, please!</p>
<p><strong>heather donahue’s voice</strong>: Josh?!?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Heather???</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Heather?? Josh???</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Heather????</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: They’re pulling my teeth out!!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Wha’ the–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –o-fug-me–</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Heaaaaather???</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’re you, crazy??</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What’re you, nuts?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>stoner #1</strong>: Check this out: Burkittsville’s Funniest
Home Videos.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Jesus-Jesus-Jesus–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What the <u>fuck</u>?!?</p>
<p><strong>stoner cameraman</strong>: Hey, that’s 50K worth of hi-tech,
chickee.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You gave me a fucking heart attack!</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Oh, and you boogied all the way up here
to get a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #3</strong>: We just made your every dream come true,
darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Get <u>out</u> of here!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What’re you doing with all this shit?</p>
<p><strong>stoner #4</strong>: Shootin’ “Blair Witch II,” man– what’s
your excuse?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Shooting “Blair Witch II.”</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Oh, dude, I don’t think so–that is just
<u>not</u> happening.</p>
<p><strong>stoner cameraman</strong>: This is <u>our</u> gig.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #3</strong>: We got <u>jurisdiction</u>, man–we got
fuckin’ <u>permits</u> to be here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, yeah? Let’s see ’em.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #4</strong>: They’re, uh, like, in the car.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Let’s put it this way: one of us is
going, and it’s <u>you</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s the hassle here?</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: You and the Brady Bunch,
Mr. Scorsese.</p>
<p><strong>stoner cameraman</strong>: You’re interfering with the
commerce of independent film!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: They’re making “Blair Witch II,” too.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No problem, just give us ’til dawn and we’re
gone.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Look, guys, we’re cold, we’re tired we’re
<u>shook</u>–we just want to get out of here as soon as there’s light.
We saw something up at Coffin Rock today–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –or someone–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –scared the living shit out of us.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know, I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –yeah, a hand or something–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –coming out of the water–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –stop it! Stop talking about it! I’m gonna
freak!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I just wanna go <u>home</u>.</p>
<p><strong>stoner #3</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>stoner cameraman</strong>: You didn’t get it on tape,
didja?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Tried, but–</p>
<p><strong>stoner #2</strong>: Strip it down and ship it out! Coffin
Rock!</p>
<p><strong>stoner #4</strong>: Any other voices or noises you hear
tonight–it ain’t us.</p>
<p><strong>stoners</strong>: Heather??? Mike???? Somebody???
Please????</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They were never seen again. Their footage was
found a year later– underexposed and useless.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How’re the cameras doing?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Due for a re-load and battery check. I’ll
get on it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: ’Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the
night just ended.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Join the club.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, everybody grab a coat, and pull up a
rock for a night of witch-watch.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Something….really twisted…is going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Jesus…wha’ happened…</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Oh, fuck me! Oh, Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: What happ–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –they’re all gone!–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –and none of ’em were mine! I-am-so-fucked,
I-am-so-fucked– where the hell was everybody???</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Asleep–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –what happened to the goddamn
“Witch-watch??”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –I dunno, I just woke up–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –last thing I remember were those four
clowns shooting the movie–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think
stole the stuff!?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah. Got to Coffin Rock, found zip, and came
back, ripped off the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u>
off.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Smells Like Teenage Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of
fucking dollars! You pricks! I’ll see you in fucking court!!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Not the only things missing, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s almost a year’s worth of work!
Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus….</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: At least you still have the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –no, I think they’re all in there.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Sonova<u>bitch</u>!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Those ours?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: My handwriting on the face labels.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: How’d you know they were–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –hunch. Just sort’ve saw ’em there.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: My ass–you saw those four fucking baboons
put ’em there!</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Cotter, I think she’s right. Why would those
guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other
stuff and leave the tapes?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Spite.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They were making a movie–if they were going to
steal anything it’d be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything
they didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I don’t think it was them.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching
equipment to make her own sequel?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Well, please keep me fucking informed!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Those four guys–it’s the only thing that
makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This is a goddamn disaster. Let’s just pack it
up and go.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I want to see the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And what do you possibly think you’re going to
fucking see there?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No idea. But if that’s all we’ve got left–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –nothing left to play ’em on, honey.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh, sorry, right.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: You can be goddamn sure, though, I’m going
to be looking at every second of ’em when I get back to Baltimore–I get
proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We’re ticketed to fly back from Baltimore,
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hey, I got a whole editing suite in my
loft–more the fucking merrier.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Pointless.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: 403 41st Street, kids: home.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I dunno it’s safe to even get out of the
car.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: By day? No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What about night?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Not a great idea. Especially ’cross the
street.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Druid Hill Park.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s a joke?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: That’s its name. A pastoral glade gamboling
with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a
week.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let’s get inside.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: First enormous brick warehouse on your
right.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter
on the ground floor– carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection
and grinding and–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Cotter: shut up.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: All I need–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Get inside quick, they’ll stop.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Too busy eating us?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Baltimore’s cheapest burglar alarm.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Had the door jimmied a few times. Nobody’s
yet made it inside.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Mi casa y su casa!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Su casa y shit-o hole-o.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hey, hon’–this is what pays the rent and
tuition.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Running a junk yard.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: English.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying,
selling–sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up,
sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Looks like business is booming.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: There’s some stuff that’s hard to part with.
Editing’s stuff’s up there–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –stairs are back through the kitchen–and a
ton of bedrooms, you wanna dump your stuff or catch a nap–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think we get the gist.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We’ve looked at half of one tape.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: There’s four other angles, man, we haven’t
even–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –great: we can watch Domini sleep for
hours–or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a
deer’ll dash by!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: For once could you just sit down, shut up, and
give something a <u>chance</u>?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’re leaving–case dismissed for lack of
evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we’re going
to graduate with no thesis.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not going anywhere, ’til–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hey, <u>chill</u>, man–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –there’s something <u>here</u>, Nick–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –fuck <u>you</u>–<u>all</u> off you–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –now c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Get your goddamn–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –oh, Jesus–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I need to go to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: She lost it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Any number of reasons–pick one, it’s as good
as the other.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was out hiking, camping the past two
days–that’s what did it–<u>I</u> killed it–</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: –doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to
remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best– it meant
something was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Something was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Look, this is not my field of expertise. You
seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let’s keep you overnight and
have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I guess–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Mrs. Leavitt–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –I’m not staying here!</p>
<p><strong>intern</strong>: Let’s talk to your husband–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –he’s not my husband!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Where are my clothes??</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We’ll stay overnight, get a hotel–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –Cotter’s–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –whatever you want, no problem–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –still go see the OB in the morning–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –no.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Nick. Do what she says.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Sleep.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville,
in the woods, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What? That made her lose the baby?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Something. Someone.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Who? What?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Women miscarry all the–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –no.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: This is a little nuts.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Turn the tapes back on.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack,
something.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’d be up on your shoulder, maybe your
lower back.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Then I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, knock it off, willya?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You wanna keep it down, she’s trying to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Sorry, I didn’t think we were making that
much noise.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s not a real “funny” time for us, okay?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No….it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Christ <u>almighty</u>–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’s going <u>on</u>?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nothing. I dunno–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –you should get back into bed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I guess, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was that you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just now?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just…try and go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I get dreams. I don’t like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’d you dream?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced.
Giggling.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: This’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: There, what? I didn’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Back it up, rewind, whatever you call
it.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’d you see?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Motion. Stop there. Play it again.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –there! In the tree.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Whatta you got, telescopic vision?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Still don’t see it–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –that blur, right by that branch.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Okay, a blur.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Can you zoom it or something, make it real
close, real big?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I’m the ebay Boy, remember? I can’t exactly
afford that kind of equipment.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Who do you know who can? Where do we go?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: For a blur?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: There is something <u>there</u>–don’t ask,
just trust me.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Can’t you like just divine it?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: If I could do that, I’d be at the goddamn
racetrack, not here.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the
whole thing blown-up, enhanced–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –go!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Four in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Cotter’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: He’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for
fingerprints the second he gets back.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: At least go drink it somewhere spilling it
won’t drive him to suicide.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What is it you thought you saw on that
tape?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Still working on it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Elly Kedward?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: No. Elly Kedward’s not the problem here, I
don’t think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch–</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You’re gonna owe me the rest of your life,
bud.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Beta Cam’s still coming back tomorrow,
right?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –hours before–</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: –Christ, they find out I let you have it for
the weekend–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –no one’ll ever know.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You mind me asking: why the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: The, uh, blur there.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Looks like a rope.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Does this look like a person stand there to
you? Domini…?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dad…?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: ….I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: So lemme see it.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just let me get my coat off–I had eight cups
of coffee, I’m wired for sound here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where <u>is</u> it?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I got the tape enhanced–and I managed to
sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he’s gonna kill me when he finds out
about the camera.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Gimme it!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Still looks like a blur, only bigger.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: My friend Sid said it looked like a
rope.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: That’s the <u>reason</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Why she kills children.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: The witch?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: It’s not about witches, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Someone want to tell me what’s going on–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –and we brought it back with us!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: It touched me, don’t you see it now?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Its fingers! Here. And <u>here</u>–</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: –and here and here and here!</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: I don’t know how to stop it! I don’t know
how to kill it! But it’s here right now!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is,
we’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: That’s why she kills children.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know, I know–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They put their palms in the blood. And then
they press them on your skin.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You gonna be alright?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Sure. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No big deal. I’m just trying to
understand.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Get some more beer.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I think you closed the bar again. I’ll have
to go out.</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: Go to the store. When you get back, I’ll try
to make sense of it for you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’re you afraid’s going to happen?</p>
<p><strong>domini</strong>: That they’ll start touching us inside our
heads.</p>
<p><strong>check-out clerk</strong>: Sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Miss?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You have a phone?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Just outside–</p>
<p><strong>operator’s voice</strong>: You have a collect call from
Heather. Will you accept the charges?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Mom…?</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I was just calling, I know it’s been a long
time–</p>
<p><strong>mom’s voice</strong>: –what do you need this time,
Heather?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nothing. It’s nothing like that. I just
wanted to know if Dad–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Mom…? Mom??</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: She wants me to talk to you,
Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Who <u>is</u> this??</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Your mother’s pastor.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What happened to my Dad??</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: There was an accident early this
morning. Another car. Your father’s injuries were fatal.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I’ll tell your mother not to expect you
at the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where’s Domini?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: My room, asleep, last I checked.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Domini…?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well, she’s got to be <u>somewhere</u>
here.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No one’s been in or out since you left.
Would’ve heard the dogs.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Domini??</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Domini!!!!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Fire escape??</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dominiiiiiiii!!!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: She would’ve had to have a key, anyway, to
lock the deadbolt behind her.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how
because she’s not here!!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Parents. She might’ve called–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Taos, New Mexico. The Sheriff’s Office,
please….thank you.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Good morning, Sheriff’s Office.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von
Teer.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: He’s in a meeting. Could I have
him–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –it’s urgent!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Could I tell him what it’s
regarding?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: His daughter, for God’s sake– I need to
know if he’s heard from her this morning.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: …the Sheriff is a widower. They never
had any children.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: ….Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m talking to Taos, New Mexico–</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: –yes–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –the Sheriff’s Office–</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: –yes, Ma’am, can I help you with
anything else?–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –his name’s Von Teer! His daughter’s named
Domini!–</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: –thank you for calling–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m glad she’s dead. She brought the thing
that killed my child.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What did you see here that I can’t see,
damnit!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What is it that scared you so much?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Finally got her back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nick, what you should do is get her back up
and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesus, you don’t think I know that? You don’t
think I’ve tried? She won’t fucking <u>go</u>– she won’t leave this
place.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: She’s off her fucking rocker–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –I know!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, I know. It’s…alright. We’re all a
little–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –a <u>lot</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Okay. Hypothetically.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think….there could’ve been something up in
those woods that Anna–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –it’s not a could’ve–there <u>was</u>,
Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused
my father to die, and it’s here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>.
And I don’t have one single idea in hell what’s going to happen next,
just that it’s going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And
then the other. It’s going to get into our <u>brains</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s explanations. Rational explanations
for everything that’s happened. We’ll drive ourselves crazy if we keep
obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That feels good. Lower–down into my
neck.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t know what it is, but there is
something <u>happening</u> here, and it’s starting to scare the living
shit out me, and look, I’m just <u>not</u> going to argue the point
anymore–you want to stay here, stay, but I’ve got to get the fuck out of
here, and I’m begging you to come <u>with</u> me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then I’m going–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –no, you’re not. You love me too much. You
don’t want to see them kill me.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: This could be something right here, do you
think it’s some- thing, Heather–?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –but that could be just a shadow, I think
it’s a shadow, it’s nothing, Heather, do you think it’s nothing–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s about the tree, it’s something about
the tree.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –the goddamn <u>tree</u>, Domini, for
chrissake, <u>what</u>?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to
the same kind of trees.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –I look and look in the tree, all I ever
see, he’s always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Cotter, where can I get on-line?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all
the time–fucking owl–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Cotter?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Fucking owl!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You think it’s possible the tree in the
Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No idea–goddamitt!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Boy Kurth.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Heather, does that look like Domini
there?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Down there in the Park.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Domini…?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Not the place you want to announce your
arrival.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: How’s she going to know where to–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –things got a way of finding <u>you</u>
here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s <u>freezing</u>.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Next time try putting on shoes–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What the fuck–??</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: The moon trying to shoot down through all
these trees–can make things funky–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –I saw what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Yeah. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the
woods with–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u>
with–200- something miles from here–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Domini!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, Jesus, what happened, are you–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Be it still alive, James?</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: –then <u>finish</u> the job, lads!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: What the fuck you do <u>that</u> for??</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –and one of the little boys, his name was
James. As in the boy James <u>Kurth</u>–the first child to disappear
from the town of Blair after they banished Elly Kedward.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I dunno it’s anything. It’s a name Anna’s
mentioned–from her dreams.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I can’t handle this anymore.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: How much of that stuff you guys been
smoking?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Enough to keep sane.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark
into something else.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Spare me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation–and a
round-the-clock obsession with the occult–hell’ve a recipe for a
mind-fuck.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Except we seem about 18 times more together
than you.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I’d strongly advise you to join us–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –before you lose your emotional lunch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yeah, what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Atta boy–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We are being fucked with here, someone or
something.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Domini.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Why in the world would <u>she</u>–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –why in the world would she just fly the coop
in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I think it’s time to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nobody’s going anywhere–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –hell, I don’t think I’m ever leaving this
place again–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –one of us, all of us–I have no
idea–brought whatever this thing is back here. We’re not going to go out
there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We’re gonna figure it out,
we’re gonna bring a goddamn <u>end</u> to it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Domini’s the only logical explanation.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We’re not dealing with fucking logic
here!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: It’s Domini, it’s not Domini, I don’t
care–all I know is <u>I’m</u> not dealing with
something–<u>anything</u>– snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we
did in the woods– surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody
monitoring those cameras every second. There’s something, somebody here,
I want to see ’em coming.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought all your equipment got stolen.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: All the shit that was worth anything, yes.
You’d be amazed, though, what you can get free on the ’net.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: That’s good! Tie it off!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –Jee-zus!!!–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –Christ!!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I can’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t! You’re making me lose my grip.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I’m coming! I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just hold on!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just let it go, I’ve got you!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What’re you nuts–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –it’s less than four feet, just–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –shit!!!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –don’t move, don’t even breathe–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Jesusjesusjesus….</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Yeah–<u>please</u> don’t do that again.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I could see up your dress.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Gothic rune–the letter “S.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Or a blood blister–or a bruise.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Must be that blue collar life we all
lead.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s a “j.”</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: For “James?”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Goes right along with these two.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Put ’em together that’s a “k.” James
Kurth–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows
what-else we could have picked up in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You <u>know</u> what we picked up in the
woods–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No one ever comes here.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Have to open the door to find out.</p>
<p><strong>voice behind the door</strong>: Cotter…? Cotter…?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: ….I’ll….go.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: I know you’re in there, you piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: You have to go.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We’re both
in a world of shit here!!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: It’s my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: I can’t let you in.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I should check on Anna.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Check the monitor, she’s <u>fine</u>.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s far from “fine.”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re needed here–keep watching–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –f’chrissake, Heather, it’s not like the two
of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –I don’t trust anybody, not even me,
anymore–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –shhhh! #5, there’s something up there!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: One of the printers.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No. We <u>all</u> go.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Anna–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –fuck Anna!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: No, you–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –it’s for you. Came through email. How it
started printing without a command, though–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –it’s the “Blair Witch Cult”–a copy– some
pages from–one of them on the site must’ve gotten my message–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –who?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Doesn’t say–it’s just these pages.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: “taken by the witch as they were marked by
her–first Jamie Kurth when the stain appeared on his brow that next
summer–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: “for t’was said he and Jon Edmunds and
other boys who found Elly Kedward still on her tree in the snow. Poking
her with sticks finding her still living. Taking her bonds and noosing
them to her neck, hanging her from her tree until she perished.”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s the little boys. Elly Kedward didn’t
die from “exposure” out there: she was executed. “Killing Elly Kedward,
but not the witch herself, who floated from the mortal husk–”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: “It’s why the witch kills children.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I thought all witches were benign and
good.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Not this one.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I need you to talk to me, talk to me about
the dreams–about James, the other boys.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t…I don’t understand them myself.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Try, please, Anna–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u>
boys–just like Domini.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A coward too. That’s why she had to go.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What happened to her, where did she go?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t know–just that she was afraid–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Anna–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My eye, is there something in my eye?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Not that I can see.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Closer. Lift the lid and look– it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Closer.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Remember….what Mary Brown said– she could
see the witch’s hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Anna’s the witch.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What the fuck’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Does she have marks, Nick–like the ones we
have, that Domini had?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Does she, goddamnit??</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Not that I’ve seen–but that has no
meaning–that means nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Maybe whatever they are, they just haven’t
appeared yet on her?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You really believe that?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s <u>possible</u> for chrissake–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –the marks appear, then you disappear. Like
the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full
bloom–and mine <u>are</u>!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Mine, too. And so are yours, pal.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Like a blueprint for disembowelment.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is
not the goddamn witch, that’s insane!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Then just give me one of your explanations
that all three of us’ll buy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t….</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I want to see something!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The clothes–take ’em off– I want to see every
square inch–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –no, what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Are you marked like this??</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I see for proof positive you’re the goddamn
witch–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You killed Domini, didn’t you, witch??</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not a witch, you’re all crazy!</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Just say you are–we won’t hurt you–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –we’ll just make you go away, so you can’t
hurt anyone else–</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: –like you hurt the baby–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –what’re you saying?? I didn’t have anything
to do with–</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: –the witch kills children–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I haven’t killed any–</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: –Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –my God, Nick???</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just say the words, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please! Please…? I haven’t done anything.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Bullshit! Talk!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nick!!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Out of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’re you <u>doing</u>??</p>
<p><strong>cotter</strong>: Hang you like the witch you are, unless–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –Nick!!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Confess!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Alright! Fuck you, fuck all of you! I’m
her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Oh, Jesus, no–</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next
to die, asshole!</p>
