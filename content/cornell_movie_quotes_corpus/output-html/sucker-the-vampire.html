<p><strong>reed</strong>: They don’t advertise for vampire henchman in
the newspaper. That’s in the special magazines… and then you don’t
believe the ads. That was my profession. Ex-roadie. Ex-nurse.
Ex-henchman. Sushi, that’s what I always called ’em cause he liked to
leave ’em in the water like a cold fish…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, I know. This! This was
the night. See, there’s Anthony. You can’t really see him, but man is he
singing!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: See, now there’s Seth. Seth… well, he was
always kind of a jerk to me really…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh! That… that is Miss Helsing! I remember
her. I remember her because that was the night, well, Anthony broke up
the band, can you believe it? Yeah. She’d been coming to the shows for a
couple of months. I knew Anthony wouldn’t like her, cause you know, he
likes blondes, but I thought maybe for Seth. I thought Seth might like
her…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: With the benefit of hindsight, maybe it wasn’t
such a hot idea.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: It was good. For a last performance.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s it, just like that?</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: We’re getting too big, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Who are you man, Perry Ferrel? Things are
going great, we’ve got offers on the table.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Which is why we have to fade out.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Anthony, think about this. We’re not huge. We
don’t have a CD. We’ve got another couple months of obscurity. So what’s
your problem?!</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: You’re my problem right now! If you want to
run the risk of being discovered, do it with another band.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well? Say something, Tobin! I know you don’t
want this to end either!</p>
<p><strong>tobin</strong>: Anthony’s right.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: See it this way, now you can pursue other
avenues, do what ever you want</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t want other avenues! I liked this! This
is my ultimate chick magnet.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: The discussion is over.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m really gonna miss this.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You guys are so great. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: I mean, your songs. They’re so deep. I’m not
sure I totally understand all of them, but you can just tell. You
know?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why are you called Plasma?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s kind of an inside joke.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Is that some sort of sick pun?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh. Um, I’m gonna go now.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: You’re leaving?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh. Yeah. I gotta be at work early tomorrow
and everything.</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Well, it was nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh… I’ll see you again.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Uh. Yeah. Bye. Bye Seth.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: I was wondering if you’d like to come back
to the house with me. There’s only so much of this I can take, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: It was nice meeting you both.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Bye, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I thought they would never leave.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Where do you think they’re going?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Probably back to Anthony’s.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Wow. I bet he’s got a great place. Where
does he live?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’ve got a nice place. You wanna go back
there?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Why don’t we go with them?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Well, to tell you the truth Seth, I was
hoping to end up with Anthony tonight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What! Lead guitar’s not good enough for you?
You gotta have the lead singer?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Take it easy, Seth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You want me to prove something, I’ll prove
something! I’ll be the best you ever had, bitch!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Don’t bet on it.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re gonna mace me? You have no idea what I
am, do you?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Stupid bitch. See, there’s something you don’t
know about me…</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Yeah. And what would that be?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: You’re a vampire? Do tell.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Holy water.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: See, I was hoping to take out Anthony
tonight, but I guess you’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It hurts! Oh Jesus, it hurts!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: What do you say, Seth? Why don’t you save
me a little footwork and tell me where Anthony lives.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Have it your way.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Go to hell!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Thanks, I think I’ll pass. Why don’t you go
on without me. And when you see your buddies down there, do me a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Tell them Vanessa sent you!</p>
<p><strong>sandy</strong>: Aren’t you gonna come in?</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: My key. Got stuck. Indeedoor.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Hurry up. REED Okay.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Reed.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: She’s in the pool.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Finished?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>anthony</strong>: Goodnight, Reed.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Um. Okay. G’night.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: This is Tuesday. Sunrise at five
twenty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Buckles!</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Where in god’s name have you been?
I’ve got a patient waiting who needs his temperature taken, right
away.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, I’ll be there in a sec.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: You’ll be there now, Nurse
Buckles.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I just gotta take care of this..</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Leave it, someone will pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No, no..no..no..</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Leave it!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Stupid jerk.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Oh, Nurse Buckles? Use a rectal
thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Now, now. There, there. This will only
hurt for a moment. We don’t want to get any viruses, do we?</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Nurse Buckles, would you restrain her
please?</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Nurse Buckles!</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Tammy, right?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: This is Ogo-Pogo. He helps me, to be
brave.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: You hold him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Now, that wasn’t so bad, was it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Okay, Tamara. We’re all finished. Go
on out and meet your mom.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: That was well done, Nurse Buckles.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: I hate shots.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Yes. Well, you handled that like a
professional. I’m very pleased.</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Be that as it may, you are still
unreliable. And I mean this; if you are late once more, I will be forced
to replace you. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>dr. pez-huoy</strong>: Good. Then I’ll see you tomorrow.
Eight A.M.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Okay, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Hi, Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Reed! You scared me. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Nothing. Just getting ready to go home.
Thought I’d stop by and say hi, see what’s new.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, it’s been an interesting day. I’ve done
three celebs.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Movie stars.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yep. One for gonorrhea, one for herpes, and
one for the whole cupcake… all STD’s.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You watch “Baywatch”?</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: California. The land of sun, surf and sexually
transmitted diseases.</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: See, now this is the perfect opportunity for
me to explain about some of the things that I did for Anthony that
weren’t in my job description; like interior design was my main attempt
to create a feng shui in his place…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: He was a sailor, he loved the sea, he loved
ships and I love them.. he made me love them and he got this thing which
is hand blown and he won’t put it out and it’s beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>reed</strong>: And I still don’t know what hand blown
means.</p>
