<h1 id="el-mariachi">el-mariachi</h1>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this
is?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Moco… What the hell do you want after all
these years?</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: We’ve got a lot to talk about. I’m just a few
town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought
I’d give you a call, amigo.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: That’s sweet of you, asshole. I don’t suppose
you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of
money.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Yes, I figured you’d want your money, my
friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out
soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really
need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you’re running quite a
business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you
well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I could stay in here and earn peanuts compared
to what you owe me if I were to get out. So, yes, I want you to help me…
my friend.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Soon my friend, soon. I’m sending you some
people in a few days to get you.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Really? Well, that’s more like it. Just like
the Moco I used to know.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Just hang in there my friend. I won’t forget
that you have been a big part of our success. What’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: There’s something going on outside. Is this a
double surprise? Are you getting me out today, Moco?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: There are two men here with guns. Did you send
them?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I’m still here, Moco. And so are your little
friends. But not for long. They have something they want to scream to
you. Listen close, because you’re going to repeat it to me when I come
to visit you.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What do you want to drink?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Refresco.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: No hay musica?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’m a mariachi. A good one. I play
beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I could add a little class to this place.
I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work,
and I can guarantee bringing in more customers.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Tell me, why would I need one little
guitar player when I’ve already got a full band?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: There you see? Either I can pay one guy
to sound like a full mariachi band…</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: … or I could spend the same money only
get one little guitar player… Understand?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You want to earn a living? Get a real
musical instrument.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What the hell is this, mariachi day?
There is no work for you here!</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Bartender… one beer.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: In a bottle, wey.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I’m looking for an old friend of mine. His
name is… Moco. Do you know where I can find him.</p>
<p><strong>main mean dude</strong>: You can sometimes find him here. He
owns this place.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: So you know him?</p>
<p><strong>main mean dude</strong>: We work for him.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Hold it please.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Get me Moco!!!</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Da me telefono.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Pit bull?</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Yeah, pit bull.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: All of them? How long ago? OK, What
does this guy look like?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: … carries a guitar case… And what was
he wearing?… all black…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Don’t worry, Moco. We’ll find him, and
we’ll mess him up real good.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Gracias se�or…</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Callate, hombre!!!</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Viejo, if you see anyone new in town,
carrying a guitar case, dressed in black… you can call this number,
OK?</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: And if I don’t call, you’ll kill
me…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude</strong>: No. I won’t kill you… he will…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Pit bull.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Yeah, pit bull.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I need a cheap room for a week, and I’d
prefer to pay you in a few days, after I’ve found some work.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: S�, later…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Thank you, friend.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Uh, excuse me se�or? I forgot, I need a
small deposit…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: You can trust me.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: I am very sorry, se�or. But… how much
can you spare?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’ve only got a few pesos… I plan on
finding work in town.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Oh, that’s enough for now, sir, thank
you and… enjoy your stay.</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: 127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!!</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Cuidado, viejo!</p>
<p><strong>viejo clerk</strong>: Pendejos!!!</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: He wears black!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much
refresco?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I just killed four guys.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Wait a minute… what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Domino.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Wait a minute, Domino! It was
self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’m new in town. I don’t know everyone!!!
I have no friends here… and no enemies.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Thieves?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: No way. They were well-dressed men. I
checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value,
except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when
I left my room, but they didn’t. They were only interested in killing
me.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: So why do you come here? You want to get me
killed?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I need a place to stay until I figure this
out. They’ve got me mixed up with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: And you’ve never seen them before? Not even
in another town?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Are you saying they followed me, a
mariachi, here? What for?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Maybe they hate your music.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Maybe you were singing in another town, they
hated your voice, and now they’re trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Are you going to help me, or am I gonna
have to die on your porch?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I have a room upstairs. My room. Don’t touch
anything. I’ll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Thank you. I’ll never forget this.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Good morning, Domino.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Give me the phone. I have to call
Moco.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: It’s not as bad as it looks. Domino,
has anyone come through here? A stranger, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: This is a boder town. I get strangers all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Dressed all in black, carrying a
guitar case?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Well, he shot me… and has killed ten
of Moco’s men… all in one day.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Aren’t you gonna call your boss?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: I have to tell Moco that he got away
again… So, you better give me a drink first.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Moco, he got away. Shot me in the arm.
Killed La Palma. Pepino, Sunday. This guy is one slick maricon. Yeah.
Also, I didn’t get a look at him. So, unless he’s still carrying that
guitar around and hasn’t changed clothes, I won’t even spot him, and I
don’t think he’ll be that obvious…</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Don’t worry. If there’s one thing I know, it’s
that he’ll always wear black and he’ll always carry that guitar with
him. It’s his signature. Besides, that’s not a guitar he’s carrying.
It’s a guitar case full of weapons. Find him.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Que paso?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: I screwed up. The guy left his guitar
case in the hotel room. We chased him out, but he came back for the
case.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Maybe he loves his guitar. It’s probably an
antique.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: It wasn’t a guitar. It was a guitar
case full of weapons that he uses on his victims. Adios, I’m gonna take
a nap. And thanks for the drink.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: If you see this guy, call us.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I thought I told you not to touch
anything.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Sorry. I needed to relax. I can…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No, it’s alright, Finish up. Do you want
shampoo?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Yes, please.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’m a musician!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: No! My guitar!</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: We’ll see…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You’re very modest, Mariachi…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You told me you killed four men, when you
really killed seven. Or were they still breathing even you shot out
their hearts?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’m a mariachi…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: … not a murderer…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Aren’t you going to watch?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I told you… I am a musician.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Play it.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: W…w…what?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: What is this place? That treats me like a
murderer? They’ve all got their heads up their butts… Even this
beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss her or hit her…
Or both?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You’re a mariachi, all right. And a good
one.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I think this is the best I’ve ever played.
You… inspired me.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Hire me.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’m good. Hire me to play in your bar.
I’ll work mostly from tips. But, I need steady work.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I couldn’t pay you. I have no money.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: This fancy place and you have no
money?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: It’s the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I’ll work for room and board, then.
Please, I’m desperate.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Will I have to keep a knife at your balls to
get you to play like that?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Not if you’re paying me room and board.
Please… until I find a permanent job.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You won’t find a permanent job in this town…
but OK.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: You’re going to need a better sense of humor
than that, if you’re gonna work for me, kid.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: Yes? One moment please…</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Amigo! I’m glad I’ve reached you! You’ve not
answered all day. Killing ten of my men must have been very time
consuming!</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I’ve only killed six! You were always bad at
maths, Moco. I guess that’s why you never paid me half of the money. You
thought it all belonged to you.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: I knew half was yours… I got greedy, my
friend. It’s my nature. But you!!! You are modest! You’ve killed ten of
my men!! I know, because I’m having them buried in my yard right now.
With my dogs and cats.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I killed six. But don’t bother counting so
soon. The number will triple by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: I’m sorry things turned out this way. My
friend. I got greedy. I should never have tried to kill you. It would
have been cheaper for me to pay you. Now I’ve got to find ten new
men.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I tell you what. You give me my money, and I
won’t kill any more of your men… And I won’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: No, it’s too late for that. We’re going to
have to see this through.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Just like the Moco I used to know. Still
wearing white?</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I think you should change clothes. I’d hate to
ruin a white suit with your stupid blood.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I need to get my money back from that
hotel. I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with that
jacket and that case you could be killed. Leave that stuff here.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I never go anywhere without it. Take care
of it.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Hi. It’s Domino.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: I know who it is… Dolly into Moco.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Can I get something to drink or eat?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: One beer.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: In a bottle, wey.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Isn’t there a girl that works here?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Yeah, she owns the place.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: She owns it, now? Then she is Moco’s girl?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: So-so. She’s onto this new musician.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I just saw a guy with a guitar case like
mine. It’s him they want.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: No, he just ordered a drink.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I don’t look anything like him…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #10</strong>: Is this the guy?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: I’m not sure…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: What’s in the case?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: My guitar.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Yeah? You’re one of those old-time
mariachis, huh?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: OK, let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: If it’s a guitar like you say it is,
we’ll never bother you again…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: If it’s not…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: … then we’ll spray paint this street
with your brains.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Sorry….</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Look, as long as you don’t carry the case
around, they’ll leave you alone. It’s that guy they’re after.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I better put this upstairs…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: That’s him…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: That’s him…</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: I’m sorry we left…</p>
<p><strong>rat #2</strong>: … We didn’t know what to do…</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: … We figured you could defend
yourself!!!</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: You thought I could defend myself…</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: … against three armed men…</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: … using this?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: My case got switched with some maricon
mariachi!</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: Where is this mariachi?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: He’s dead by now… So, I want you to go look
for my case.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Leave me a wepon.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: That was disloyal of you to leave me out
there. You should be as loyal to me as you are to each other.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Are you loyal?</p>
<p><strong>rat #2</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Are you loyal?</p>
<p><strong>rat #2</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Then shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: You are loyal, are you not? SHOOT HIM. Or I
shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: You said we should be as loyal to you as we
are to each other. I couldn’t shoot him, for that would be as disloyal
as shooting you.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Very good. Now go find my case.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Where were you when he came into the
bar?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I was on the phone, talking to a friend that
knows what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Did you mention me?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No… He told me the man in black is Azul.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: If his name is Azul, why doesn’t he wear
blue?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I don’t know… Anyway, he’s killing the men
of the town drug dealer. The dealer’s name is Mauricio. But he’s known
as Moco.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: And Moco is sending these men to find
Azul. So, why do they chase me?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: They have never seen Azul… only Moco knows
him. My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears
black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Couldn’t you tell your friend that there
are two people like that in his town? One is a killer, and one is a
mariachi.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Only special people can talk to Moco.
Besides, you’ve killed a few of his men, now. Your best option is to
keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case
until this is all over.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: He got away… but I got a good look at
him.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Coca, Caca, Beto were killed.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: He won’t get away again, Moco. I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Are you always closed Monday nights, or
did you close since I can’t play my guitar tonight?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Mondays are my day off. Want to play a
game?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Come see me.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I don’t feel well. I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Have you ridden the bike?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No… I’ve got to go…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: I can’t figure out something. You tell me
you’re poor. Poor family. Yet you’ve got this place.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: This place is a gift.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: From who?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: From Mauricio.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: From EL MOCO? The man trying to kill
me?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He’s not trying to kill you, his man had you
confused with Azul.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Same thing.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Look, you now how if you want to impress a
girl, you send her flowers, candy, jewelry until you win her love?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: If one present doesn’t work, you keep
sending bigger and better things until you win her or you’re broke?</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Correct…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then
jewelry, then he gave me a job at his saloon, then he gave me the whole
saloon… etc.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: He’s still giving you things?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He’ll never run out of money.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: And you accept it all? What’s the last
thing he sent you?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: A motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He wants me to ride out to his ranch when
I’ve decided to be his. He thinks he’s close to having me.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Is he?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: He was.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: So, you really are from a poor family.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I remember when I was growing up, we were so
poor, that my brothers and sisters and I all slept on the same blanket
stretched out across the floor. We had to sleep in a circle, with our
fingers in each other’s ears, to keep the bugs from crawling into
them.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Ay, wey…</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Here’s a little bit I’ve saved. I want you
to go get a new guitar.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Take it, stupid. I’m not saying go by the
best one, just a temporary one so you can play again tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: That’s him…</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Loco, he’s headed your way… black
pants, white shirt.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Where did he go, Loco?</p>
<p><strong>loco</strong>: He got in my truck.</p>
<p><strong>mean dude #5</strong>: Take him around the block.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: That’s not him.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Where’s my case?</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: We couldn’t find it.</p>
<p><strong>rat #2</strong>: We heard they caught you and were taking you
to Moco’s ranch.</p>
<p><strong>rat #1</strong>: … so we came to see if it was true.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: They caught the mariachi.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: One beer.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: My guitar case.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Where’s Mariachi?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Where’s my case?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: If you want your mariachi back, come with
me.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Why will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Because you know where Moco’s ranch is… I
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: You help me, I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: Mauricio!!</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Play along…</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Open the gate or she’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: I’m sorry he used you to get to me,
Domino.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Azul, let her go and you’ll get your
money.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Moco, give me my money or I ruin your clothes
with her blood.</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: What have you done with Mariachi?</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: The musician your men confused with
Azul.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: So that’s why you were busy that night…</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: … you had that little monkey climbing all over
you.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: After all I’ve done for you, this is how you
treat me?</p>
<p><strong>domino</strong>: I never asked you for anything until now.
Let Mariachi go.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: I swear I’ll kill her!</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: No you won’t. I will.</p>
<p><strong>azul</strong>: All I wanted was my rightful share. But you’ve
got to kill everybody.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: You feel sorry for her, don’t you? See, that’s
why you can’t ever be as big as me.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Because you have too much heart.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Stop here.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Domino!!! We’re leaving!!! Right
now!!!</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>mariachi</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: She gave the case back to that guy. She
left with him to find you.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Bring that musician out here so he can be
reunited with my Domino.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: He’s gone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Find him!!</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: So you’re the little mariachi that came to
town, killed my men, and stole my girl…</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: You are very talented.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: I bet you play the guitarra real well,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>moco</strong>: Now get the hell off my property and take your
hand with you!!!</p>
