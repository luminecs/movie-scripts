<h1 id="alone-in-the-dark">alone-in-the-dark</h1>
<p><strong>p.o.v. creature:</strong>: Tomething chases Young Edward
through the dark forest. Its P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on
him.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’s going on, Adams?</p>
<p><strong>deputy adams</strong>: Twenty kids live at this orphanage,
Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: After the power went out, I went to
check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them.
They just disappeared…</p>
<p><strong>ext. forest - later</strong>: 3 3</p>
<p><strong>3a 3a</strong>: Deputy Adams comes through the trees and
emerges into a clearing in the woods.</p>
<p><strong>ext. shed - moments later 4</strong>: Deputy Adams shines his
flashlight around the outside of the Shed.</p>
<p><strong>int. shed - moments later</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>ext. orphanage</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>deputy adams</strong>: Sheriff! I found one! White, male,
about ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He’s in a utility shed maybe
half a mile from the orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>int. shed</strong>: 7 7</p>
<p><strong>deputy adams</strong>: Are you okay, son? Are the other kids
around here?</p>
<p><strong>young edward</strong>: I don’t know… I don’t remember…</p>
<p><strong>deputy adams</strong>: Why don’t we start with your name? Do
you remember your name?</p>
<p><strong>young edward</strong>: Edward… Edward Carnby.</p>
<p><strong>int. airplane - day</strong>: 8 8</p>
<p><strong>small boy</strong>: Did you have a nightmare?</p>
<p><strong>small boy</strong>: You ate cheese with dinner. My mommy says
cheese gives you nightmares. Want to see my coloring book?</p>
<p><strong>small boy</strong>: I think there’s a vampire living in my
closet, but my mommy says vampires and ghosts aren’t real. She says
there’s nothing to be afraid of in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Your mother is wrong. Being afraid of the
dark is what keeps most of us alive.</p>
<p><strong>small boy</strong>: Everybody else tells me not to be
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: That’s because they don’t know the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>ext. airport terminal - day</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: So, maybe you’re thinking I’m an asshole,
trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. But that’s where you’re
wrong. Because I’ve got my reasons. There’s a world around you that
you’ve trained yourself not to see. You’ve willfully closed your eyes.
But your fear of the dark is not a weakness. It’s there to protect you
from things you’d better pray you never see. My eyes were forced open a
long time ago. Now I know. Just because you can’t see something, doesn’t
mean it can’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>13a 13a</strong>: Behind the wheel of the taxi sits JAMES
PINKERTON . His face is drawn, grim. He wears dark sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>13b 13b</strong>: The two taxis drive through traffic.
Pinkerton’s taxi lags a few cars back, but matches Carnby’s taxi move
for move.</p>
<p><strong>13c 13c</strong>: The CABBIE , manic bordering on crazy,
steers through traffic.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: You travel light.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Trust me, I’m carrying enough baggage for
the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: That’s pretty funny, man. What do you
do?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: You really want to know?</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Yeah, man. Hearing about my passengers’
lives keeps the job interesting.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m a paranormal investigator.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: Get the fuck outta here!</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m an effective solution to unusual
problems.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Speaking of which, that taxi’s been
following us since the airport.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: No shit? Want me to lose him?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: If you can…</p>
<p><strong>13cc ext. city streets 13cc</strong>: Carnby’s taxi
accelerates down the street, pulling away from Pinkerton’s taxi.</p>
<p><strong>13d 13d</strong>: A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS,
open shops, and produce stalls.</p>
<p><strong>cabbie</strong>: I’m trapped, man!</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’ll draw him away…</p>
<p><strong>13e 13e</strong>: Pinkerton comes CRASHING through the
display window, landing in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass.</p>
<p><strong>13f 13f</strong>: Carnby stands in a crowd of BYSTANDERS,
watching in surprise as Pinkerton exits the Bakery, his expression
fierce.</p>
<p><strong>13g 13g</strong>: Jars of different shapes and sizes
containing a variety of medicinal herbs and other such substances are on
display.</p>
<p><strong>13h 13h</strong>: Carnby BURSTS out of the Herbalist Store’s
back door, exiting out into a small, cluttered Alley.</p>
<p><strong>beat cop</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>13j 13j</strong>: The refrigerated Ice Factory is filled with
neat rows of ice blocks. FACTORY WORKERS mill about, transporting the
blocks of ice through the Factory.</p>
<p><strong>ext. museum - day</strong>: 17 17</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/main hall - day</strong>: 18 18</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Got another delivery, Ms. Cedrac.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I don’t have anything scheduled. What museum
was it transferred from?</p>
<p><strong>delivery guy</strong>: For Dr. Hudgens, from Dr. Hudgens.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It’s probably an error. It must be for the
big Abkani show.</p>
<p><strong>delivery guy</strong>: Abkani? What the hell’s Abkani?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Ancient Native American civilization. They
were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years
ago, they just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>line</strong>: You’ve been reading up.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Not much else to do around here at night.</p>
<p><strong>delivery guy</strong>: Says here it’s not to be opened by
anyone but Dr. Hudgens.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This is Aline Cedrac. She’s the assistant
curator.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: We’ve got Abkani artifacts coming in from
museums around the world. Until Hudgens gets back, I’m doing all the
cataloguing anyway.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where is Hudgens anyway? The show opens in a
few days.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Off on another archeological goosechase. He
thinks he’s finally found the Erebus.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: So he sticks you with the work. At least it
keeps your mind off your boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>line</strong>: I’ll be in my office if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>delivery guy</strong>: What was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Damn it… I shouldn’t have said that. Her
boyfriend’s been missing for the last three months.</p>
<p><strong>delivery guy</strong>: Nice going, jack-ass.</p>
<p><strong>ext. ship deck - day</strong>: 19 19</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: They say a sunken ship is like a
grave. It should never be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: I’ve been searching for the Erebus for
twenty years, Captain. Now that I’ve found it, I’m afraid your
ill-informed superstitions aren’t enough to stop me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. water surface</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>ext. ship deck</strong>: 1 21</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Bring it up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. water surface</strong>: 22 22</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - dusk</strong>: 23 23</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Edward, John here. Hope things went well
wherever you were this time. And, please, do not, I repeat, do not tell
me about it. Every time you tell me about your latest case, I get
nightmares for a week. Anyway, give me a call when you get back. Linda
wants to have you by for dinner. Lord knows why, but she seems to like
you. And if you haven’t scared Aline away yet, bring her along.</p>
<p><strong>ext. docks - night</strong>: 24 24</p>
<p><strong>ext. ship deck - night</strong>: 26 26</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: Don’t you want to open it? Make
sure it’s what you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: The conditions must be perfect. Otherwise,
there will be… consequences.</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: Is this made of solid gold?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Did you know the Abkani were the first
civilization to use gold for their valuables? They believed it held the
power to contain evil spirits. Thousands of years later, we don’t even
remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place. Now, let’s load
it onto the truck.</p>
<p><strong>26a 26a</strong>: Carnby sits in his lab area, studying the
lynchpin artifact under an illuminated magnifying lamp.</p>
<p><strong>26b 26b</strong>: The Office is cluttered with books, maps,
diagrams, and strange artifacts. Along one wall are several ceiling-high
shelving units, each containing rows of drawers. The drawers hold
artifacts from the Museum’s collection.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It
seems to be some sort of… prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The
world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I’ve
ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>26c 26c</strong>: Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the
container. The First Mate and Crewman Barnes stand quietly behind
them.</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: If the container’s made of gold,
whatever’s inside must be worth a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: You have no idea…</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: But I’m looking forward to finding
out.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: I suppose one should not be surprised when
mercenaries act mercenary.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: You’re making a terrible mistake.</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: The only mistake would be letting
you walk out with whatever’s in there. Barnes…</p>
<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: Throw him in there.</p>
<p><strong>int. ship storage room - continuous</strong>: 27 27</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Captain! Don’t open it!</p>
<p><strong>ext. ship deck - continuous</strong>: 28 28</p>
<p><strong>aptain chernick</strong>: Let’s see what all the fuss is
about…</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - at that moment</strong>: 9 29</p>
<p><strong>int. john’s house/bedroom - at that moment</strong>: 30

<p><strong>captain chernick</strong>: Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>int. ship storage room</strong>: 0 40</p>
<p><strong>int. bureau 713/hallway - night</strong>: 48 48</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: his better be good, Miles.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Sir, we’re getting some strange
readings in the control room.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: his is Bureau 713. “Strange” doesn’t even
crack my radar. Now what’s the situation?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal
activity range from three to five…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors
picking up now?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: They only go up to 50.</p>
<p><strong>int. bureau 713 headquarters/control room -
continuous</strong>: 9 49</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What are we looking at, Krashinsky?</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Electromagnetics off the scale,
Commander.</p>
<p><strong>agent yonek</strong>: Recalibrating sensors now, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. orphanage/den - night - twenty years ago</strong>: 50
50</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: Still having trouble sleeping, Edward?
You can’t stay up all night, you know.</p>
<p><strong>young edward</strong>: Sister, something’s happened.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: What is it, Edward?</p>
<p><strong>young edward</strong>: They’re not gone anymore. The others

<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - day</strong>: 54 54</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Edward, thank god!</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Linda, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s John. I woke up and… he’s just gone. All
his clothes are here. His car’s in the garage. It’s like he just got up
in the middle of the night and walked out.</p>
<p><strong>ext. john’s house/front porch - day</strong>: 5 55</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’ll figure this out, Linda. I’ll find
John.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Edward… you’ve known each other since you
were kids. Did he… did he tell you he was leaving me?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Then where is he, Edward? What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>57a 57a</strong>: The Orphanage looks much the same after
twenty years. It is slightly more worn-down, but still
well-maintained.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: arnby drives up the gravel driveway in his black
SUV. He pulls to a stop behind an old, battered yellow School Bus.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: Welcome home, Edward.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Should I make some tea?</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: Yes. Thank you, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: Let me get a look at you. Are you
sleeping enough?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Sister… John disappeared last night. And
something happened to me as well.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: It’s happening again.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I need your help, Sister. I need to find the
others.</p>
<p><strong>sister clara</strong>: I’ll get their files.</p>
<p><strong>57c 57c</strong>: Carnby is on the phone, sitting in front of
his computer. While he speaks, he reads information on the FEDERAL
MISSING PERSON DATABASE. The computer processes information.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’ll let you know as soon as I hear
something.</p>
<p><strong>ext. restaurant patio - day</strong>: 58 58</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Why did I agree to this?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I ordered for you, Fischer. It’s pecan.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: You’ve got a good memory, Carnby.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: I tracked down the three you asked about.
They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just
up and walked out in the middle of the night.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: That means all nineteen are missing.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: I ran full cross-references. Nothing much
in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage.
Your orphanage. What’s going on, Carnby?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to find out.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Thanks Fischer. It’s good to know I’ve still
got friends at 713.</p>
<p><strong>ext. museum - dusk</strong>: 60 60</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/aline’s office - night</strong>: 61 61</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Did a shipment arrive for me today?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It’s a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I
started decoding the pictograms and…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Who told you to do that? That crate was not
to be opened.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I was only going to catalogue it for you.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: It’s not your place to question my
instructions, Ms. Cedrac. Leave the tablet alone. I’ll catalogue it
myself when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: There’s… somebody here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/main hall - dusk</strong>: 62 62</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Edward…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I missed you too.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I thought you were dead, you asshole!</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Aline… let me explain. In private.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Give me one reason why I’d ever want to speak
to you again?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It’s Abkani…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Five minutes, Aline. I’ll tell you
everything.</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/aline’s office</strong>: 63 63</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I was in the Amazon for six weeks, tracking
poachers through their transport lines. Then I fell in with a group of
ex- Chilean military selling artifacts on the black-market. This was
found in a gold mine in the southern tip of Chile.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: And how did you end up with it?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I asked very nicely.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: You should’ve called, Edward. Or written.
Just to let me know you were alive.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Does it make any sense to you?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Yesterday, maybe not. But something happened
last night.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: They were found in completely different
locations. Alaska. Newfoundland. Venezuela. And now this one’s from
Chile.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Ten thousand years ago, it would’ve been
like burying them at the ends of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The Abkani’s written language is based on
pictograms. Combinations of symbols to create different meanings. But
there’s one here I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: You’re not trying to seduce me, are you?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Give me that.</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/main hall</strong>: 65 65</p>
<p><strong>uard</strong>: I don’t care if nothing’s wrong with the grid.
Something’s definitely wrong with our power. Get someone down here,
pronto.</p>
<p><strong>65a 65a</strong>: Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway.
Framed art hangs from the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along
the way.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Hairs on the back of my neck just stood
up.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: How come every time you show up, my life gets
complicated?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I could ask you the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>65c 65c</strong>: Aline leads the way with the flashlight,
followed by Carnby. The Hallway is only faintly lit.</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/ceramics room</strong>: 69 69</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I think we’d better run…</p>
<p><strong>69a 69a</strong>: Aline and Carnby run down the long Hallway,
towards a pair of double-doors at the other end.</p>
<p><strong>69b 69b</strong>: Carnby leans up against the door, pushing
it closed. Aline fumbles for her building keys.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Can’t hold it…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Is there any way out of here?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: No! Why didn’t you ask me that before you
pushed me in here?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Those doors lead to the front entrance.</p>

<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: There!</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Losing readings.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Cheung! Marko! Don’t let them get
away!</p>
<p><strong>5a 85a</strong>: Krash reads the data streaming by on her
banks of monitors. She speaks into her omnipresent headset.</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Readings gone. You lost them, Barr.</p>
<p><strong>85b 85b</strong>: Agent Barr holds his rifle trained at
Carnby and Aline.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Goddamn it, Krash, I know. Commander
Burke, we’re secure. And sir… Carnby is here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. museum - night</strong>: 86 86</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I want a full security sweep. Miles, get
Fischer to send his sci-and-spy boys down here. Now go.</p>
<p><strong>int. museum/main hall</strong>: 87 87</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: hat the hell are you doing here, Carnby?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Hey Richie.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s Commander Burke. This is my unit.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: They saved our lives.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You used to be able to take care of yourself,
Carnby. Gotten soft since you left 713?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Ms. Cedrac, I’m Agent Miles. This is
Commander Burke.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Aline Cedrac. Pleasure to meet you. How’s the
Ph.D. coming along?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It’s fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Miles, get her to a medic.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’ll catch up.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Why am I still looking at you?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I need to know what those things are.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: That information’s classified. If you were
still an agent, you’d already know. But since you’re not, stay out of my
way.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m asking nicely.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Get him out of here!</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: You’re right, Commander. I guess I have gone
soft.</p>
<p><strong>ext. museum - later</strong>: 91 91</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I want to finish studying those
artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I need to find out what’s happened to John
and the others. Stay in contact. We’ll meet up later.</p>
<p><strong>91a 91a</strong>: Burke oversees a team of AGENTS in
biohazard suits as they sweep the scene, running scans of the area on
high-tech hand- held devices. Photos are snapped by another AGENT.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Commander, I need to get to my office.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: The museum’s quarantined until we’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: At least let me pack up my work. There’s
priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: If you notice anything out of the ordinary,
let me know immediately.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I don’t think I want to know your definition
of out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>int. fischer’s lab - night</strong>: 103 103</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: You shouldn’t be here, Carnby.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m not here. Commander Burke is. Now what
the hell is that thing inside him?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Your curiosity have anything to do with the
fingerprint of yours I found on his corpse?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: The list of people I trust is short,
Fischer. Is it about to get shorter?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Have you I-D’d him?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Yeah, we got dentals. Agent James
Pinkerton. He’s ex-713.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: He was an agent? When?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Went MIA twenty years ago. Presumed dead.
I’m trying to get more intell, but his records are so classified,
they’re practically invisible.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: arnby takes the tongs from Fischer, holding open
the skin. Fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel,
disconnecting the spinal-worm from Pinkerton’s spine.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: It’s fused with his nervous system.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: I’ve never seen this kind of symbiosis
before.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Scanner’s still reading something…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: The Abkani never cease to amaze me.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Such a complex society at a time when most
of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around
fires.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Dr. Hudgens. When did you get back?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: A few hours ago. I heard there was some
excitement. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I’m fine. A bit shaken up. But fine.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: I apologize for snapping at you earlier.
Now, what are you still doing here after all you’ve been through?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Where did you get that image?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Edward.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: This is a major find. I’ll need to analyze
it. Confirm its authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I can do that myself.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: That wasn’t a request…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Where is the artifact?</p>
<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: Everything okay in here?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: Ms. Cedrac’s security detail.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: My dear, do you have any idea who I…</p>
<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: Dr. Lionel Hudgens. Former agent,
sci-and- spy division. Currently 713 advisor status. I know exactly who
you are. But I’m not your “dear” anything.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: I’ll just have to hold off my curiosity
until morning.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Dr. Hudgens… I forgot to ask. Did you find
the Erebus this time?</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Just an empty shipwreck. You were right. It
was another wild goosechase.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Since when do I have a security detail?</p>
<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: Since it seemed like you needed
it.</p>
<p><strong>int. fischer’s lab - later</strong>: 104 104</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: There’s one inside you too. But the
symbiosis is incomplete.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Can you remove it?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: I could try. But it might paralyze you.</p>
<p><strong>104a int. museum/aline’s office - later 104a</strong>: Aline
sits at her computer, checking out 3-D scans of the four Abkani
artifacts. She is running an analysis the symbols carved into each
artifact.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: What’s missing…</p>
<p><strong>int. fischer’s lab - later</strong>: 107 107</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m not much for coincidences. These
organisms must be connected to those things from the museum.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: We call them xenomorphs.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Catchy. When did they first appear?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Two years ago. They’ve been 713’s top
priority ever since. But it’s been almost exclusively in rural areas.
This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Have you isolated any weaknesses?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Most metals pass right through them. So
normal bullets and blades are useless. But they’re vulnerable to
elements 76 to 79. Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold. Negates their
ability to disrupt electricity.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: If they disrupt electricity, why did my
flashlight still work?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: The closer the current to its power source,
the less disruption.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: This is calibrated to track their
disruption field. It won’t help you see them, but you’ll know when
they’re nearby.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: They live almost exclusively in darkness.
Sunlight’s lethal in large doses. But only certain light frequencies
hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>ischer</strong>: These lamps are set to an effective
frequency.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: But for maximum damage, we use bullets
coated in a photon-accelerated luminescent resin. Cuts right through
them.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I’m going to need a lot of those.</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - day</strong>: 115 115</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Five minutes…</p>
<p><strong>int. fischer’s lab</strong>: 116 116</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Fischer…</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Commander Burke wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ext. carnby’s building - day</strong>: 117 117</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - continuous</strong>: 119 119</p>
<p><strong>line</strong>: Edward?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I see nothing’s changed…</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Edward?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Sweet dreams…</p>
<p><strong>119b int. bureau 713 headquarters/control room 119b</strong>:
Burke stands behind Krash at the monitor banks, surveying the incoming
information.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Have you been meeting with Carnby?</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Yes. He’s got intell we need. And I trust
him.</p>
<p><strong>urke</strong>: We’ve got to trust each other, Fischer. Are
you with us or not?</p>
<p><strong>ischer</strong>: What do you need from me?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: All the intell you’ve got on Edward
Carnby.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: What else could I do? I had to tell
him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah fischer</strong>: You did the right thing, Paul. From
what you’ve told me, Carnby can take care of himself.</p>
<p><strong>sarah fischer</strong>: I’ll get it. You stir.</p>
<p><strong>fischer</strong>: Sarah? Answer me! Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: If you can’t beat us, Fischer, join us.</p>
<p><strong>119j int. shed - night - twenty years ago 119j</strong>:
Young Edward enters the Shed, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - night</strong>: 124 124</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Something smells amazing.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I love omelettes.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I figured out a connection with the symbols
on those artifacts. They correspond to constellations. But something’s
missing.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Maybe this will help…</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Can you run the program on this?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: What are we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The Abkani used constellations to pin- point
a geographical location. But I don’t think I can isolate it closer than
a hundred mile radius.</p>
<p><strong>line</strong>: Edward…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Yeah. That’s us right there.</p>
<p><strong>int. carnby’s loft - moments later</strong>: 127 127</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: John?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Behind you!</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: That looked like John.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: It is. The other two are from the orphanage
as well.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting
John in the chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: You had no choice.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Something’s controlling them.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: How many are there altogether?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Twenty. Including me.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: ll that is visible of the creature’s trajectory
is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards
them.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: We’d better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>gent barr</strong>: Carnby located.</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Multiple readings confirmed. Back-up’s on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Roger that. We’re hot.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Aline!</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Where the hell’s our back-up?</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Landing.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: We’re clear, sir.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Love what you’ve done with the place,
Carnby.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Sir, this one’s infected too!</p>
<p><strong>agent turner</strong>: Got another one here!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Drop your weapon and get down on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: He’s been infected with some kind of
organism. He could be under its control.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: It’s true. I’ve got one inside me. But it’s
not controlling me.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You’ll excuse me if I don’t take your word
for it. Now drop your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>agent turner</strong>: Get out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: He’s not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>urke</strong>: If I’ve got to shoot through you to get to
him, I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Why are the lights still out?</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Scanner’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Krash?</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: All Agents! You’ve got to kill the organism
to stop them! Aim for the spine!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Confirmed. Spinal shot’s a kill shot.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: You remember the number one rule they teach
you in 713 training? Trust your instincts.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Fischer’s missing. So is Hudgens. And I’ve
got a situation brewing that makes this scrap look like a bar brawl.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: What does Hudgens have to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: That’s what I want to find out. I need you
both to brief me in the air.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Oh, and Carnby… I’ll need my I-D back.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mine - night</strong>: 134 134</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Krash! What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: We’re practically off the scale, Commander.
This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: The military? We don’t have time to wait for
them to mobilize.</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Is that a negative, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: No. Initiate Nine-Alpha on my authority. But
I won’t hold my breath. By the time this clears Defense Council, we’ll
be dead or drinking…</p>
<p><strong>int. mine entrance hall - night</strong>: 135 135</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: We’ve got three perimeters of flash-
mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And
every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander…</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I know, Miles. But back-up won’t make it
before sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>agent turner</strong>: Generator will be on-line shortly,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It looks like you’re going to war.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We are. The highest xeno concentration on
record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe
them out once and for all.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: We need to go down there.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: They’re coming here for a reason. Until we
know what they’re after, we’re never really going to be able to stop
them.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Something’s definitely down there, sir.
But there’s too much interference to get a clear reading from here.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Goddamn it. Miles, you’re in charge of
perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what’s down
there.</p>
<p><strong>135a ext. mine 135a</strong>: Batteries of flash-mines set to
electromagnetic sensors are being positioned in wide perimeters around
the Entrance Hall.</p>
<p><strong>scene 136 omitted</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>int. mine tunnel</strong>: 37 137</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: I’ve been thinking about something. The
Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Every culture has a story about the end of
the world.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: But not every story starts to come true.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: It’s definitely this way, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. tunnel chamber</strong>: 144 144</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: It’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Readings are getting stronger.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We’ll double-back. Take another tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Wait. Aline, look at this…</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: They’re Abkani.</p>
<p><strong>agent cheung</strong>: There’s more over here.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: What do you got, Marko?</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Marko!</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 145 145</p>
<p><strong>int. tunnel chamber</strong>: 46 146</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We’ve got to get down there.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Defense perimeter’s up. Still waiting
for the generator to come on-line.</p>
<p><strong>urke</strong>: We’re retrieving Marko. Keep me posted.</p>
<p><strong>agent feenstra</strong>: How long do we have to hold
them?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Only until dawn.</p>
<p><strong>agent feenstra</strong>: Sir… that’s four hours away.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: I know.</p>

<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: We’ve got incoming! What are your
orders?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Hold tight, Miles. Once we retrieve Marko
we’re coming back up. Whatever’s down here is going to have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>ext. mine</strong>: 152 152</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: They’ve hit the outer perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>krash</strong>: Electromagnetics around the mine are off the

<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Krash? Report! Krash?</p>
<p><strong>int. shaft</strong>: 53 153</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Aline!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Cheung! Cut the line!</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 154 154</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he Sand Chamber is pitch black. The only light
comes from their lamps and flashlights.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: It’s a warning.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Subtle.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The gist of it is, even if you make it down
here alive, you’re already dead.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Krash, I need another exit. Can you run a
sonar pulse at this depth?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Krash? Are you reading me? Miles?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Can’t get through to Krash either. Too
much interference.</p>
<p><strong>urke</strong>: Use the second perimeter as your firing mark.
I’ll be there as soon as I find a way out.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Hold your fire until they’re at the
second perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>ext. mine</strong>: 155 155</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: Ammo running low! How many of
these goddamn things are there?</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 156 156</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Aline!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: We’ve got to get up there.</p>
<p><strong>156a int. mine entrance hall 156a</strong>: The Agents FIRE
streaks of glowing bullets into the night. Flash-mines EXPLODE close
by.</p>
<p><strong>gent turner</strong>: Hit it.</p>
<p><strong>int. mine entrance hall</strong>: 158 158</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: They’re turning back!</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: here’s a moment of quiet. The Agents slump back,
relieved. The creatures are all gone.</p>
<p><strong>helicopter pilot</strong>: We’ve got to refuel and reload.
We’ll be back ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>agent feenstra</strong>: We made it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: gent Turner turns to see Fischer approaching.</p>
<p><strong>agent turner</strong>: Fischer?</p>
<p><strong>159a int. mine entrance hall 159a</strong>: The spotlights

rifle-mounted lamps.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: gent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of
glowing bullets at the approaching creatures.</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 160 160</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Miles! Re-route those `copters! Pull all
agents back into the mine! Set formation in teams of three! Miles!</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: We’ll find a way out.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: It’s just like the organism Fischer took out
of Pinkerton.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Maybe this is what they look like when they
grow outside a human host?</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: I think you’d better see this.</p>
<p><strong>161 a 161</strong>: gents Miles, Agent Feenstra, and two
other AGENTS, are barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery. They
SHOOT streams of glowing bullets across the dark Entrance Hall.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Feenstra!</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 162 162</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: line comes up to the concrete wall, running her
hands along its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The Abkani didn’t put this here.</p>
<p><strong>gent barr</strong>: There’s no way through.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: There’s always a way…</p>
<p><strong>int. mine entrance hall</strong>: 163 163</p>
<p><strong>agent feenstra</strong>: I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Last one.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Commander? Krash? Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>agent feenstra</strong>: I can’t walk. If I lay down
suppressing fire, maybe you can make it out of here.</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: I die fighting or I don’t die at
all.</p>
<p><strong>int. sand chamber</strong>: 164 164</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: You sure this is going to work?</p>
<p><strong>int. underground lab</strong>: 170 170</p>

<p><strong>carnby</strong>: This is where it happened.</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Commander…</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on
the door. One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Edward, look…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: So it’s a key.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: The pictograms carved here make it pretty
clear that’s a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place.
Keep whatever’s in there, down here for good.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: The answers I’ve been looking for my whole
life could be in there.</p>
<p><strong>aline</strong>: Some doors are locked for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Barr… how much C-4 you got left?</p>
<p><strong>agent barr</strong>: Enough to blow this place to…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t allow that.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Now drop your weapons and back away.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Our early work was crude, I admit. But
eventually we perfected the implant process. You were our last failure,
Carnby. If you hadn’t escaped, 713 never would’ve shut down the
experiments.</p>
<p><strong>burke</strong>: There’s no way this was sanctioned.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Before your kind took over, 713 had very
different… priorities. Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything
before we can learn to control it. I’ve wasted twenty years working in
secret because of short-sighted men like you.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: There it is…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: You were a fine archeologist.</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Aline…</p>
<p><strong>carnby</strong>: Give him the key. Enough people have died
today.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: You couldn’t have opened it anyway. Not
without this…</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Insert the key.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: line inserts the device into the opening in the
door.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: Now turn it.</p>
<p><strong>hudgens</strong>: When we found the first of them, 713 saw
just another threat to be eliminated. But I knew it was something more.
It was the first. The first to wake. I’ve woken others since then. But
the rest are coming…</p>
<p><strong>74a int. cave 174a</strong>: Hudgens steps through the
