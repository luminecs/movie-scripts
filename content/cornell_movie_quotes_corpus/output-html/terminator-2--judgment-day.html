<h1 id="terminator-2judgment-day">terminator-2–judgment-day</h1>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 3 billion human lives ended on August 29th,
1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.
They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the
Machines…</p>
<p><strong>sequence of rapid cuts</strong>: :5A Explosions! Beam-weapons
firing like searing strobe-light. 5B A gunner is an armored personnel
carrier fires a LAW rocket at a pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in
a fiery explosion. 5C Another APC is crushed under the treads of a
massive Ground HK.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Skynet, the computer which controlled the
machines, sent two terminators back through time. Their mission: to
destroy the leader of the human Resistance… John Connor. My son.</p>
<p><strong>8b terminator</strong>: I need your clothes, your boots, and
your motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>cigar biker</strong>: You forgot to say please.</p>
<p><strong>trucker</strong>: Evening…</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I can’t let you take the man’s wheels, son.
Now get off or I’ll put you down.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …John? John! Get in here right now and clean
up that pigsty of yours.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Gimme that Phillips right there.</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: I swear I’ve had it with that goddamn kid.
He won’t even answer me. Todd? Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna
do something?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: John! Get your ass inside right now and do
what your mother says!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s not my mother, Todd!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Major moves, homes! So… where is your real mom,
anyway? She dead or something?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She might as well be.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: The next patient is a 29-year old female
diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder. The usual indicators…
depression, anxiety, violent acting-out, delusions of persecution. Here
we are.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: ’Morning, Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Good morning, Dr. Silberman. How’s the
knee?</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Fine, Sarah. She, uh… stabbed me in the
kneecap with a screwdriver a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: The delusional architecture is
interesting. She believes a machine called a “terminator”, which looks
human of course, was sent back though time to kill her. And also that
the father of her child was a soldier, sent to protect her… he was from
the future too… The year 2029, if I remember correctly. Let’s move on,
shall we?</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Douglas, I don’t like seeing the patients
disturbing their rooms like this. See that she takes her thorazine,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Time to take you meds, Connor.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You take it.</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Now you know you got to be good ’cause you
up for review this afternoon…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not taking it. Now I don’t want any
trouble…</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Ain’t no trouble at all –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You… son of a… AAARRGH!!</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Last call, sugar.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Easy money!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Where’d you learn all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: From my mom. My real mom, I mean. Come on
baby… Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: That her?</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: So she’s pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Actually, no, she’s a complete psycho. That’s
why she’s up at Pescedero. She tries to blow up a computer factory, but
she got shot and arrested.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, she’s a total loser. C’mon, let’s check
out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?</p>
<p><strong>officer x</strong>: Are you the legal guardian of John
Connor?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That’s right, officer. What’s he done now?</p>
<p><strong>officer x</strong>: Could I speak with him, please?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Well, you could if he was here. Be he took off
on his bike this morning. Could be anywhere. You gonna tell me what his
is about?</p>
<p><strong>officer x</strong>: I just need to ask him a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: There was a guy here this morning asking
about him, too.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah, big guy. On a bike. Has that got
something to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>officer x</strong>: I wouldn’t worry. Do you have a
photograph of John?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Get the album, Janelle.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Kyle..? You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I know. This is a dream, Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh. Yeah. They… make me take this stuff…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hold me.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I love you. I always will.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh, God… Kyle. I need you so much.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Where’s John, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They took him from me.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: It’s John who’s the target now. You have to
protect him. He’s wide open.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Don’t quit, Sarah. Our son need you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know, but I’m not as strong as I’m supposed
to be. I can’t do it. I’m screwing up the mission.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Remember the message… the future is not set.
There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Kyle, don’t go!</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: There’s not much time left in the world,
Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>video sarah</strong>: … it’s… like a giant strobe light,
burning right through my eyes… but somehow I can still see. Look, you
know the dream’s the same every night, why do I have to –</p>
<p><strong>video silberman</strong>: Please continue…</p>
<p><strong>31b video sarah</strong>: The children look like burnt paper…
black, not moving. Then the blast wave hits them and they fly apart like
leaves…”</p>
<p><strong>video silberman</strong>: Dreams about cataclysm, or the end
of the world, are very common, Sarah…</p>
<p><strong>video sarah</strong>: It’s not just a dream. It’s real, you
moron! I know the date is happens!!</p>
<p><strong>video silberman</strong>: I’m sure it feels very real to you
–</p>
<p><strong>video sarah</strong>: On August 29th 1997 it’s going to feel
pretty fucking real to you, too! Anybody not wearing number two million
sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?</p>
<p><strong>video silberman</strong>: Relax now, Sarah –</p>
<p><strong>video sarah</strong>: You think you’re alive and safe, but
you’re already dead. Everybody, you, him… everybody… you’re all fucking
dead!</p>
<p><strong>video sarah</strong>: You’re the one living in a dream,
Silberman, not me! Because I know it happens. It happens!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I was afraid… and confused. I feel much
better, now. Clearer.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Yes. Your attitude have been very
positive lately.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It has helped me a lot to have a goal,
something to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: And what it that?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You said I could be transferred to the
minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six
months. Well, it’s been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing
my son.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: I see. Let’s go back to what you were
saying about these terminator machines. Now you think they don’t
exist?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They don’t exist. I see that now.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: But you’ve told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If I had, there would have been some
evidence. They would have found something at the factory.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: I see. So you don’t believe anymore that
the company covered it up?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Greetings, troops.</p>
<p><strong>bryant</strong>: Mr. Dyson? The material teams wants to run
another test on the uh… on it.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Yup. Come on. I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>bryant</strong>: Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven’t been
here that long, but I was wondering if you could tell me… I mean, if you
know…</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>bryant</strong>: Well… where it came from.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I asked them that question once. Know what
they told me? Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So what do you think, Doctor? I’ve shown a
lot of improvement, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: You see, Sarah… here’s the problem. I
know how smart you are, and I think you’re just telling me what I want
to hear. I don’t think you really believe who you’ve been telling me
today.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You have to let me see my son. Please. It’s
very important. He’s in danger. At least let me call him –</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: I’m afraid not. Not for a while. I don’t
see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here
another six months.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: YOU SON OF A BITCH!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddammit. Let me go!! Silberman! You don’t
know what you’re doing! You fuck! You’re dead! You hear me!!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Model citizen.</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Yeah, he was here about fifteen minutes
ago. I think he said he was going to the Galleria.</p>
<p><strong>officer x</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>40a terminator pov – of two kids on a bike down in the
canal.</strong>: THE IMAGE SNAP-ZOOMS IN. FREEZES ON THE DRIVER’S FACE.
“IDENT POS” FLASHES NEXT TO THE BLURRY IMAGE OF JOHN.</p>
<p><strong>tim</strong>: Some cop is scoping for you, dude.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa… time out. Stop the bike!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now don’t take this the wrong way, but you are
a terminator, right?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No way!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Holy shit… you’re really real! I mean… whoah!
You’re, uh… like a machine underneath, right… but sort of alive
outside?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I’m a cybernetic organism. Living tissue
over a metal endoskeleton.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This in intense. Get a grip, John. Okay, uh…
you’re not here to kill me… I figured that part out for myself. So
what’s the deal?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: My mission is to protect you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah? Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You did. Thirty years from now you
reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is deep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So this other guy? He’s a terminator too,
right, like you?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced
prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Liquid metal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Radical.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You are targeted for termination. The
T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where we going?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: We have to leave the city, immediately.
And avoid the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can I stop by my house?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try
to reacquire you there.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta
warn them. Shit! You got a quarter?</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Janelle? It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: John? Where are you, honey? It’s late. You
should come home, dear. I’m making a casserole.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Something’s wrong. She’s never this nice.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What the hell’s the goddamn dog barking at?
SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The dog’s really barking. Maybe it’s already
there. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: John? John, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I’m right here. I’m fine. What’s the
dog’s name?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Hey, Janelle, what’s wrong with Wolfy? I
can hear him barking. Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>janelle</strong>: Wolfy’s fine, honey. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Your foster parents are dead. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need a minute here, okay? You’re telling me
it can imitate anything it touches?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Anything it samples by physical
contact.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like it could disguise itself as anything… a
pack of cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No. Only an object of equal size.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, why doesn’t become a bomb or something
to get me?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: It can’t form complex machines. Guns and
explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn’t work that way. But
it can form solid metal shapes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua… places
like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy,
running guns. Then there were some other guys. She’d shack up with
anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this
great military leader. Then she gets busted and it’s like… sorry kid,
your mom’s a psycho. Didn’t you know? It’s like… everything I’d been
brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for
that. But everything she said was true. We gotta get her out of
there.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Negative. The T-1000’s highest
probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for
you to make contact with her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, great. And what happens to her?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Typically, the subject being copied is
terminated.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn’t you tell me? We
gotta right now!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Negative. She is not a mission
priority.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, well fuck you, she’s a priority to
me!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, goddammit! What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Help! HELP!! I’m being kidnapped! Get this
psycho off of me!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let go of me!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oww! Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You told me to.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have to do what I say?!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: That is one of my mission
parameters.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Prove it… stand on one foot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Cool! My own terminator. This is great!</p>
<p><strong>first jock</strong>: Hey, kid. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Take a hike, bozo.</p>
<p><strong>first jock</strong>: Yeah? Fuck you, you little dipshit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dipshit? Did you say dipshit?! Grab this
guy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now who’s the dipshit, you jock douchebag?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put the gun down! NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Walk away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus… you were gonna kill that guy!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Of course. I’m a terminator.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen to me, very carefully, okay? You’re not
a terminator any more. Alright? You got that? You can’t just go around
killing people!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whattaya mean, why? ’Cause you can’t!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You just can’t, okay? Trust me on this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, I’m gonna go get my mom. You wanna come
along, that’s fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>detective weathersby</strong>: These were taken at the West
Highland police station in 1984. You were there.</p>
<p><strong>mossberg</strong>: He killed seventeen police officers that
night. Recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>mossberg</strong>: This one was taken by a Japanese tourist
today.</p>
<p><strong>weathersby</strong>: Ms. Connor, you’ve been told that your
son’s missing. His foster parents have been murdered, and we know this
guy’s involved. Talk to us. Don’t you care?</p>
<p><strong>mossberg</strong>: We’re wasting out time.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Sorry, gentleman…</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: You have a Sarah Connor here?</p>
<p><strong>night nurse</strong>: Running late, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>night nurse</strong>: Your friends are on their way out
now…</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Lewis, see these gentleman out and them
lock up for the night.</p>
<p><strong>night nurse</strong>: Whatcha got, Lewis?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000/guard</strong>: Just some trash.</p>
<p><strong>t-1000/guard</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>night nurse</strong>: Gotta check the gun first, Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>t-1000/guard</strong>: Yeah, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: You broke my arm!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There’s 215 bones in the human body,
motherfucker. That’s one. Now don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>douglas</strong>: Open the door! The goddamn bitch is loose
in the halls!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Now remember, you’re not gonna kill anyone,
right?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Swear.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just say “I swear I won’t kill anyone.”</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I swear I will not kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: He’ll live.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Open it or he’ll be dead before he hits the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>2nd attendant</strong>: There’s no way, Connor. Let him
go.</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: It won’t work, Sarah. You’re no killer. I
don’t believe you’d do it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re already dead, Silberman. Everybody
here dies. You know I believe that. So don’t fuck with me!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Open the goddamn door!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Step back!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Down on the floor! Now!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Get her!</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: Go around, goddamnit! Go around!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom!! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No! Help me! Goddamnit, it’s gonna kill us
all!!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Come with me if you want to live.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s all right, Mom. He’s here to help.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Go! Run!</p>
<p><strong>beat…</strong>: Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches
through the ceiling and spears down four feet into the elevator car. It
is inches from Sarah’s face. She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM – right through
the roof. Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again,
slashing Terminator’s jacket, and missing John by inches. Terminator
chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in the ceiling.
Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal
shafts slash down again and again. Sarah yells in pain as one of them
slices open her upper arm.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Out of the car!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: RIGHT NOW!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I said I was okay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It was stupid of you to go there.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than
that. You’re too important! You can’t risk yourself, not even for me, do
you understand? I can take care of myself. I was doing fine. Jesus,
John. You almost got yourself killed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I… had to get you out of the place… I’m sorry,
I…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Stop it! Right now! You can’t cry, John.
Other kids can afford to cry. You can’t.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: What is wrong with your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So what’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>silberman</strong>: … it was all true and we’re all going to
die and the changed, I saw him change!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This T-1000… what happens when you shoot
it?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Ballistic penetration shocks it, but
only for a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Can it be destroyed?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Unknown.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pull in here. We have to ditch this car.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You look like handmade shit.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I have detailed files on human
anatomy.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I sense injuries. The data could be
called pain.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Will these heal up?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s good. Because if you can’t pass for
human, you won’t be much good to us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How long do you live? I mean, last?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: A hundred and twenty years on my
existing power cell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you learn? So you can be… you know. More
human. Not such a dork all the time.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: My CPU is a neural-net processor… a
learning computer. But Skynet presets the switch to “read-only” when we
are sent out alone.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Doesn’t want you thinking too much, huh?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can we reset the switch?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Now open the port cover.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Hold the CPU by its base tab. Pull.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you see the pin switch?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Out of the way, John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No! Don’t kill him!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It, John. Not him. It.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Alright, it! We need it!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re better off by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But it’s the only proof we have to the future…
about the war and all that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t trust it! These things are hard to
kill, John, believe me, I know. We may never have this opportunity
again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, Mom, if I’m supposed to ever be this
great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in
a while. ’Cause if you won’t, nobody else will.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Was there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No problem. None whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are we learning yet?</p>
<p><strong>92c terminator</strong>: We need to get as far from the city
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Just head south.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Keep it under sixty-five. We can’t afford to
be pulled over.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, no. You gotta listen to the way people
talk. See, you don’t say like “Affirmative” or some shit like that. You
say… no problemo.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It someone comes off to you with an attitude,
you say “eat me”… if you wanna shine them on, it’s “Hasta la vista,
baby”.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: “Hasta la vista, baby”?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, or “later, dickwad.” Or if someone gets
upset you say “chill out.” Like that. Or you can do combinations.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Chill out, dickwad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s great! See, you’re getting it.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No problemo.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You got any cash?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Only a couple hundred bucks. I’ll give you
half.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get some food.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And that’s another thing. You could lighten up
a bit, yourself. This severe routine is getting old. Smile once in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Smile?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Smile. You know. People smile, right?
Watch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. Nice place you got here. How’s
business?</p>
<p><strong>window woman</strong>: Gimme a break.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Bad example. Over there, look.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know, maybe you could practice in
front of a mirror or something.</p>
<p><strong>first kid</strong>: You’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>second kid</strong>: Am not!</p>
<p><strong>first kid</strong>: Are so!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re not gonna make it, are we? People, I
mean.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: It is in your nature to destroy
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. Drag, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I need to know how Skynet get built. Who’s
responsible?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: The man most directly responsible is
Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems
Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why him?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: In a few months he creates a
revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: In three years Cyberdyne will become the
largest supplier of military computer systems. All stealth bombers are
upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned, Afterward,
the fly with a perfect operational record.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Uh huh, great. Then those fat fucks in
Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show,
right?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Basically. The Skynet funding bill is
passed. The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are
removed from strategic defense. Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric
rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a
panic, they try to pull the plug.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And Skynet fights back.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Yes. It launches its ICBMs against their
targets in Russia.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why attack Russia?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Because Skynet knows the Russian
counter-strike will remove its enemies here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jesus. How much do you know about Dyson?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I have detailed files.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I want to know everything. What he looks
like. Where he lives. Everything.</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: You going to work all day?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I’m sorry, baby. This thing is just kicking
my ass. I thought we had it with this one…</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: … but the output went to shit after three
seconds. I’m thinking now it’s the way I’m matrixing the command
hierarchies…</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: You need a break. You’ll see it clear when
you come back.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I can’t</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: Miles, it’s Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Oh. I can’t, honey. I’m on a roll here.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Baby, this thing is going to blow ’em all
away. It’s a neural-net process –</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: I know. You told me. It’s a neural-net
processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It’s superconducting at room
temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison. But
why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, ’cause I
feel like I’m going crazy here, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I’m sorry, honey, it’s just that I’m thiiis
close.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never
makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a
hangover. Meet the pilot.</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: Why did you marry me, Miles? Why did we
have these two children? You don’t need us. Your heart and your mind are
in here. But it doesn’t love you like we do.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: How about spending some time with your
other babies?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Stay in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>a102 angle from inside another trailer, nearby.</strong>: A
DARK FIGURE in the F.G. has an AK-47 trained on the pickup as Sarah gets
out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Enrique? You here?</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: You pretty jumpy, Connor.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Good to see you, Connor. I knew you’d make
it back here sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Oye, Big John! Que pasa? Who’s your very
large friend?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s cool, Enrique. He’s… uh… this is my Uncle
Bob. Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Hmmm. Uncle Bob, huh? Okay. Yolanda. Get
out here, we got company. And bring some fucking tequila!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Uncle Bob?</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: So, Sarahlita, you getting famous, you know
that? All over the goddamn TV.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Honey, take Pacolito. Thanks, baby.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Drink?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I just came for my stuff. And I need clothes,
food, and one of your trucks.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Hey, how about the fillings out of my
fucking teeth while you’re at it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Now, Enrique. You two are on weapons
detail.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hook it on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: One thing about my mom… she always plans
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I thought you’d like this place.</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: This is the best truck, but the water pump
is blown. You got the time to change it out?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yeah. I’m gonna wait till dark to cross the
border. Enrique, it’s dangerous for you here. You get out tonight, too,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: Yeah, Saralita. Sure. Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See, I grew up in places like this, so I just
thought it was how people lived… riding around in helicopters. Learning
how to blow shit up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a
regular school. The other kids were, like, into Nintendo.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you ever afraid?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not even of dying?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t feel any emotion about it one way or
the other?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No. I have to stay functional until my
mission is complete. Then it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I have to stay functional too. “I’m too
important”.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s definitely you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There was this one guy that was kinda cool. He
taught me engines. Hold this a second. Mom screwed it up, of course.
Sooner or later she’d always tell them about Judgment Day and me being
this world leader and that’s be all she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Torque wrench please.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I’m, like,
45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he
hasn’t even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where’s that
other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but
she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it
totally, of course. Like she says she got something in her eye.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Why do you cry?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You mean people? I don’t know. We just cry.
You know. When it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Pain causes it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh-unh, no, it’s different… It’s when there’s
nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Alriight!! My man!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No problemo.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Watching John with the machine, it was
suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave
him… it would always be there. And it would never hurt him, never shout
at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn’t spend time with him
because it was too busy. And it would die to protect him. Of all the
would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this
machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was
the sanest choice.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … if we are ever separated, and can’t make
contact, go to Enrique’s airstrip. I’ll rendezvous with you there.</p>
<p><strong>bike cop</strong>: Howdy. I saw you pulled over here earlier.
Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Everything’s fine. Thanks for checking.
Since you’re here, though, can I talk to you a second…</p>
<p><strong>salceda</strong>: She said you go south with him… … tonight,
like you planned. She will meet you tomorrow in…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mommm!! Wait!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: “No fate.” No fate but what we make. My father
told her this… I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a
message to her – Never mind. Okay, the whole thing goes “The future is
not set. There is no fate but what we make for ourselves.”</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: She intends to change the future
somehow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I guess, yeah – Oh shit!!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Dyson.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, gotta be! Miles Dyson! She’s gonna blow
him away!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on. Let’s go. LET’S GO!!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: This is tactically dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Drive faster.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: The T-1000 has the same files that I do.
It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson’s house.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care. We’ve gotta stop her.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Killing Dyson might actually prevent the
war.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t care!! There’s gotta be another way.
Haven’t you learned anything?! Haven’t you figured out why you can’t
kill people?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, maybe you don’t care if you live or die.
But everybody’s not like that! Okay?! We have feelings. We hurt. We’re
afraid. You gotta learn this stuff, man, I’m not kidding. It’s
important.</p>
<p><strong>pop!!</strong>: 132B His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying
his with glass. He jerks back, utterly shocked… and spins to see the
huge hole blown through the window behind him. This saves him as
K-THUMP! – the second shot blows the top of his high-backed chain into
an explosion of stuffing an inch from his head. Instinctively he dives
to the carpet as –</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Run, kids! Go! Run!</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: Miles! Oh my God!!</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Stay back!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit, we’re too late!</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: Danny! DANNY!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Daaaaddddeeee!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t fucking move! Don’t FUCKING MOVE!! Get
on the floor, bitch! Now!! Fucking down! NOW!!</p>
<p><strong>blythe</strong>: Don’t hurt my father!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shut up, kid! Get out of the way!!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Please… let… the kids… go…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shut up! SHUT UP!! Motherfucker! It’s all
your fault! IT’S YOUR FAULT!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I couldn’t… oh, God. You… came here… to stop
me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay. It’ll by okay. We’ll figure it
out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I love you, John. I always have.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I know, Mom. I know.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Clean penetration. No shattered bone.
Compression should control the loss of blood.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Do you have bandages?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: In the bathroom. Danny, can you get them for
us?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Who are you people?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Show him.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Now listen to me very carefully.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it
all down. Skynet. Judgment Day… the history of things to come. It’s not
every day you find out you’re responsible for 3 billion deaths. He took
it pretty well, considering…</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I feel like I’M gonna throw up.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: You’re judging me on thing’s I haven’t even
done yet. Jesus. How were we supposed to know?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yeah. Right. How were you supposed to know?
Fucking men… all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your…
fucking ideas and your weapons. Did you know that every gun in the world
is named after a man? Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov… all
men. Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women… men like you thought it up.
You’re so creative. You don’t know what it’s like to really create
something… to create a life. To feel it growing inside you. All you know
how to create is death… you fucking bastards.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive
here. I don’t see this as a gender-related issue. She’s still tense. We
still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. Right?</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: But I thought… aren’t we changing things? I
mean… right now? Changing the way it goes?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: That’s right! There’s no way I’m going to
finish the new processor now. Forget it. I’m out of it. I’m quitting
Cyberdyne tomorrow… I’ll sell real estate, I don’t care,,,</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Look, whatever you want me to do, I’ll do. I
just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No one must follow your work.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Alright, yeah. You’re right. We have to
destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive… and everything I
have here. Everything! I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>138 fire roaring in a metal trash barrel.</strong>: Stacks of
files are dumped onto it. WIDER reveals we are in –</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Do you know about the chip?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What chip?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne… It’s
gotta be from the other one like you.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: The CPU from the first terminator.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Son of a bitch, I knew it!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: They told us not to ask where they got it. I
thought… Japan… hell, I don’t know. I didn’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Those lying motherfuckers!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was
shattered… didn’t work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new
directions… things we would never have thought of. All this work is
based on it.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I must be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Can you get us in there, past security?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I think so, yeah. When?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Now? Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>tarissa</strong>: Miles, I’m scared. Okay. But the only thing
that scares me more than you going… is you not going.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Is it safe for them here?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Take your kids. Go to a hotel. Right
now. Don’t pack. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The future, always so clear to me, has become
like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now…
making up history as we went along.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Evening, Paul. These are friends of mine from
out of town, I just thought I’d take them up and show them around.</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Dyson. You know the rules
about visitors in the lab. I need written authoriz –</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I insist.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: The vault needs two keys to open. Mine… … and
one from the security station. It’s in a locker but my card should
access it. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>moshier</strong>: Honey, I’m home…</p>
<p><strong>moshier</strong>: Hey, man, you shouldn’t leave the –</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: What? WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Silent alarm’s been tripped. It neutralizes
the codes throughout the building. Nothing’ll open now.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: We should abort.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: NO!! We’re going all the way! You got that,
Dyson?</p>
<p><strong>gibbons</strong>: … multiple armed subjects. Look, I think
it’s the guy from that mall shootout, and the woman… yeah, her. Pretty
sure. Just send everything you’ve got in the area –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You guys get started on the lab… I can open
this.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: No good.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Let me try mine.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! Fire-in-the-hole!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Fire’s set off the halo system! Here…
hurry!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Here!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: We’ll have to keep these on a couple minutes,
till the gas clears.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: All units, all units. 211 in progress at
2144 Kramer Street, the Cyberdyne building. Multiple suspects, armed
with automatic weapons and explosives. SWAT unit is en route…</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Yeah, all that stuff! And all the disks in
those offices. Especially my office… everything in my office! These,
too! This is important. And all this here… that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Give me that thing a second.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I’ve worked for years on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Easy money.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: How do you set them off?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Radio remote.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got it. Piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Go! I’ll finish here.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I’ll deal with the police.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Remember what I said, you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And let’s see what’s behind door number
one.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Got ol’ Skynet by the ball now, Miles. Come
on, let’s book!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ready to rock?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Time to go. Right now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dyson, hand me the detonator. Let’s go –</p>
<p><strong>160a crash!! the doors at the back end of the lab are kicked
open.</strong>: SWAT LEADER and two others OPEN FIRE. Their M-16s rake
the room. Sarah dives behind a computer cabinet. Dyson is HIT. He is
slammed to the floor by the impacts.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mommm!!!</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: Go.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Get back.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Cover you ears and open you mouth.</p>
<p><strong>dyson</strong>: I don’t know… how much longer… I can… hold
this thing…</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Fall back!! Everybody out! Move it! OUT
NOW!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t forget. It’s always darkness right
before… you’re totally fucked.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Keep your eyes closed. Don’t move. I’ll
be back.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Stop where you are. Lie down on the floor,
face down. Down on floor, now!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Drop him.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: You’re not hitting him!</p>
<p><strong>swat #1</strong>: Yes I am!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John, get under these. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Goddamn, are you alri –</p>
<p><strong>186 john</strong>: Holy shit. Come on, Mom… we gotta keep
moving… come on –</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: We need your truck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Faster! He’s right on us!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Drive for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where you going?!</p>
<p><strong>shudder and</strong>: 192C SCREAM. IT IS JACK-KNIFING. Almost
dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires are
shrieking over the pavement. The tractor is smashed back at right-angles
to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Hasta la vista, baby.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, Mom, we gotta get out now, come on.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: We don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on! Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Mom, you can do it! Come on!!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: RUN!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, you gotta try… please, Mom. Get
up!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mom! MOMMM!!</p>
<p><strong>t-1000</strong>: Call to John. Now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John? John? Can you hear me? Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Help me, honey…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John, get out of the way!!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: SHOOT!!!!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I need a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is it dead?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Terminated.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will it melt in there?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Yes. Throw it in.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: And the chip.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s finally over.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: No. There is another chip.</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: And it must be destroyed also.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I’m sorry, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no no!! It’ll be okay. Stay with us!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I have to go away, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t do it. Please… don’t go –</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: It must end here… or I am the
future.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I order you not to!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: I know now why you cry. But it is
something I can never do. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>215 the sun, pure in a cloudless sky</strong>: Tilting down
reveal that we are in a park, very green. People are casually dressed,
having fun. Cycling, reading… children are playing in a playground.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: August 29th 1997 came and went. Nothing much
happened. Michael Jackson turned forty. There was no Judgment Day.
People went to work as they always do, laughed, complained, watched TV,
made love.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wanted to run down the street yelling… to
grab them all and say “Every day form this day is a gift. Use it well!”
Instead I got drunk.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That was thirty years ago. But the dark
future which never came still exists for me, and it always will, like
the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light. And the war
against the machines goes on. Or, to be more precise, the war against
those who build the wrong machines.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John fights the war differently than it was
foretold. Here, on the battlefield of the Senate, the weapons are common
sense… and hope.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Tie me, grandma.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The luxury of hope was given to me by the
Terminator. Because if a machine can learn the value of human life…
maybe we can too.</p>
