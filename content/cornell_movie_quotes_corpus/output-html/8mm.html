<h1 id="mm">8mm</h1>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Follow that limousine. Don’t get too close,
don’t let it get too far away. Just keep with it.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: You kidding?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Uh, listen… you’re not supposed to be
smoking in here. I’m sorry, that’s company policy…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How about this… every cigarette I smoke, I
give you five dollars?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Okay… okay, yeah, that’d be good…</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Do you know how much I missed you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s this… have you been smoking… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Smoking? I’m not smoking.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Your clothing reeks of it.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You know, Amy, I’ve been sitting around in
bars and everywhere following this guy… I mean, is this what I get first
thing? Before you even “hello,” you accuse me… ?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m not accusing you…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, I’m not smoking, okay?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Okay, I believe you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’ve been all through that. I’ve been on my
best behavior.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, pumpkin-head, did you miss me? I sure
missed you…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Let’s get my bags and get the hell out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How’s the detective business?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Business was fine. I’ll tell you what, you
couldn’t pay me enough to live down there.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You better not be smoking, that’s all I can
say.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Honey, I’m not, please…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What’s all the trouble, Cinderella? What are
you crying about, huh?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning
franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are
in the report, and information about the woman. It’s unpleasant, I know.
I apologize…</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: None too discreet, is he?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, sir, he is not.</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: He’s an imbecile. I tried to warn my
daughter, but what can you do?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: The um… you’ll find my invoice in the
envelope. If that’s all…</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of
further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You think you’ll have time for the water heater
this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Sure. I’ll call the guy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re not using the same guy who tried to fix
it?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m not using him again for anything. He was
worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Betty’s out of town so we’re playing next
week.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello. Yes… could you hold on a minute…?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, I’ve got it. Hello… sorry, I was
switching phones. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Christian. Yes. Yes, I understand… tomorrow evening should be
fine…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Mister Welles. You’re very
prompt.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I try to be.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I appreciate your coming on such
short notice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: This is Mister Longdale, my late
husband’s attorney.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Uh huh, pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Apparently Mr. Longdale has something
he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Yes, I do have something to say. I
insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted
you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: As Mr. Christian’s attorney and one of the
executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort
should take place without my being asked to attend.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Of what sort?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: You are a private investigator?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has
for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly
be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the
record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Yes, how theatrical. So you’ve gone
on the record, and now perhaps you should just be gone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Have a pleasant evening. Will you
have tea, Mister Welles?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He’s odd.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: He’s a lawyer. Please, sit, here…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I’ve spoken to friends of mine and my
husband’s, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I
must say you have friends in influential places.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ve been privileged to provide services for
people I admire.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: You are highly recommended. Praised
for your discretion… your strict adherence to confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: As you know, my husband passed away
recently. Two weeks ago now.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: My condolences.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: His passing has left me with…
something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll do whatever I can to help.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: His inner sanctum.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Not many people have been inside this
room.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Pittsburgh?</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Mostly. That’s where he started his
empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that
was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: We were married forty-five years.
Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of
places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and
I to him. I loved him deeply.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I wear a gun when I can tell a client
expects me to. Other than that, there’s never any reason.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Just curious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: My husband was the only one with the
combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned
it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You hired someone to open it. I’ll bet the
lawyer loved that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: There was nothing he could do. My
husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the
contents. I felt these were my husband’s private things. I didn’t… I
didn’t realize…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Do you want to tell me what you found?</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Cash, stock certificates, and
this…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: It’s a film… of a girl being
murdered.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m afraid I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: This is a movie showing a girl being
murdered. She’s sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her… and he begins to
cut her with a knife… I only watched what I could.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I didn’t know what to think. I can’t
tell you how horrible it’s been, to know this belonged to my husband. To
know that he watched this… this atrocity. But, I can’t go to the
police…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mrs. Christian… please, will you sit down a
moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you’re talking about is a
“snuff film.” But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of… urban
myth. Like, red light district folklore. There’s no such thing, I can
assure you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Please, believe me. This is probably a stag
film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there
are ways of making it look realistic… fake blood and special
effects…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: If you were to study it you’d see the camera
cutting away… you’d see the tricks they can play…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I’m telling you it’s not that.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m sure it is. It’s probably something your
husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched
it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Will you watch it and see for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Of course. But, I’m certain it’s nothing to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You… you need to go to the police.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I told you I can’t, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You don’t have any other choice.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: No. For me to live with the ruin of
my husband’s name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished.
If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I’ll say my
husband confessed on his death bed. I’ll say I didn’t have courage to
come forward at first…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It won’t work like that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Any evidence you collect can be given
to the police later, anonymously. I’ve thought about it and there’s no
other way. If you can’t find them… if the only thing that comes from
this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I
can’t let that happen. I’m telling you I won’t. If there’s no chance
that poor girl’s memory can be served, then I’ll just have to spend my
last days trying to forget her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I deal in divorce cases. Corporate
investigations…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: You’ve found missing persons
before.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nothing remotely like this.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I know what I’m asking. Your
compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You’ll need cash to buy
information, and I’ll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You
saw what he did to her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is the mortgage. This is Cindy’s
college money.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Sometimes you can’t know what I’m doing.
It’s better that way.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s a missing persons case… a long shot.
I’ll give it two months, two months at most, then I’ll be back. We’ll
take a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why the gun?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m not gonna need it. I won’t even wear it.
It’s a precaution. Don’t worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, honey, it’s me. I’m fine, how are
you?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Call me Tom.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Alright, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What I’d like, very simply, is access to
your archive. And, now I understand this isn’t something you normally do
for private citizens…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: There are reasons for the way we do things
here.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Absolutely. Of course I’ll abide by whatever
decision you make, but I’d appreciate if you’ll hear me out…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple
living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they
picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into
Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked
homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them
buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn’t have much to say,
but they got a sense she’s a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor’s
working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should
pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused
herself… That’s the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for
help, the reason I’m coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the
department work up a sketch… They want to see if I can I.D. this girl,
somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid’s alive,
doing alright.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or
N.C.M.E.C.?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I figured you share information.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: For whatever reasons I thought you might be
more receptive.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Why don’t they come to me?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This doctor and wife, they’re nice people,
but they don’t want to get too involved. They’re not trying to have the
parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes,
not often, but sometimes there’s real reasons why a kid’ll run.
Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl’s probably eighteen, so
she’s legal.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I’m not so sure about this.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: They’re putting themselves in place of this
kid’s parents and thinking they’d want to hear their girl’s okay, even
if that’s all they hear.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: I can give you my card, if your clients
want to call me…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: They were pretty clear they didn’t want this
coming back on them.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well, that’s all I can do. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who knows… maybe she’s already given her
parents a call, right?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Excuse me… Tom, hold on…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why
don’t you come on back in… we’ll see what we can do.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: This is it. It’s not much. We’ve got less
than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in December. I’ll
have someone show it to you anyway. Other than that, I’m afraid it’s the
wet thumb method.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Files are mostly by state and year of
disappearance. We try to keep the children and adults separate. No
eating or smoking in here, but there’s a coffee machine in the hall.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Any good?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: It’s horrible, but it’ll be your best
friend after a few days. I hope you realize what kind of long shot
you’re chasing after.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re gonna be seeing a lot of me. You’re
sure you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: It’s good what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles. Here’s
where we stand. I checked the film stock and it’s called Supra- lux 544.
The company that made that stock discontinued it in ’92… Yeah, about
five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband’s
old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Yes… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name’s Thomas Jones,
I’m a state licensed investigator…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ve been hired as an independent contractor
by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal
audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I’d like to make an
appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I don’t understand, who are… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a
support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Washington. I’m sure you’ve dealt with them
before?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: These volunteer organizations are sort of
interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The
R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations… … fact-check
their records, see if there’s anything they missed, anything they should
be doing different. I’m here for a few days, before I head back up to
Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke
to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What was the name… ? I’ve got it here
somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Neil… Neil Cole.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Right, Agent Cole told me he’d call and let
you know to expect me. He didn’t call?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, I’m following up on your daughter,
Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde
hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that’s
how she’s listed. Is this information correct… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m sorry, I know this isn’t easy. Is there
a more convenient time… ? Can I buy you lunch, would that be
alright?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s very important you don’t let this raise
your expectations. It’s not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I’m
saying is, please know, I’m not here to create any false hope.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: They hired you. You’re like, a private
detective?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s exactly what I am.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I didn’t think there were private
detectives anymore, except on TV.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You probably expect me to be wearing a
trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting
beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it’s really like?
It’s sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days
straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy
thinks his wife’s cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired
you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have
told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife’s cheating, and you
don’t blame her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s refreshing to actually sit down and
meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, she didn’t leave a note? She never gave
any indication where she might go, before she left?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: She just seemed… depressed… ?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: She didn’t seem herself. For months
there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went
to bed… the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What was she running from?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: If there’s anything you feel uncomfortable
talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband… he committed
suicide?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary
disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: We were divorced by then. Things fell
apart… he was living with a friend…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why do you think he did it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: It got to be too much for him.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You have to forgive me, but in these
circumstances… with your daughter… Were there any indications of… any
sort of abuse?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: There wasn’t anything like that. The
police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn’t anything happened like
that, never. My husband… his heart broke when Mary left…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: You try going through what we did. Bob
couldn’t take it, that’s all. Christ, there’s times when it still seems
like I can’t either.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I had to ask. I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No one knows what it’s like. You can’t
even imagine how much it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: People remember me from the news. Can
you drive me back now?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: This is her room.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: The police made a wreck of it, but I
put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I… I shouldn’t take anymore of your time.
Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I’ll call tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You should be able to take a shower and
still have hot water left, honey. Call him back and tell him I said so.
The goddamn thing’s still under warranty. I’m okay. It’s hard here. It’s
hard. I’ve got a lead I have to follow through. To be honest, I don’t
think I’m going to get very far. I miss you. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: We weren’t religious. We never forced
religion down her throat, like I’ve seen some parents do to their kids.
We never made her go to church. But, after Mary was gone, that’s when I
got religious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Doesn’t make much sense, does it? When
everything’s happy, when life’s fine and you have every reason to
believe there’s a God, you don’t bother. Then, something horrible
happens… that’s when you start praying all the time. That’s when you
start going to church.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’re all like that.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Are you religious?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: You should be.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ve got what I need for my report. There
is… there is one thing that bothers me though.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s not really my place, but it’s not easy
for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know
a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave
a note. It’s guilt. They want to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: There wasn’t one. The police
looked.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Do you think the police did a good job?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I don’t know. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It is possible… and I know this isn’t
something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note
where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your
husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you
something…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No. You don’t have any reason to think
that…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: If the police focused their search in her
room, her belongings, well that’d be only natural, but they may have
been looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: How… how can you say that to me…?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Will you let me look?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: My husband never laid a hand on her.
She would have told me… she would have told me…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re probably right, and I probably won’t
find anything. I don’t have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out
of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there’s a part
of me that can’t let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They
could have missed something. They probably didn’t. Wouldn’t you rather
know?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Go ahead and look if you want. I don’t
care what you do.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “Dear mom. If you’re reading this, it
means I called you from Hollywood, California and told you where to find
my diary. I don’t think I’ll be able to tell you this when I talk to
you, so I’m writing it down here. You know I haven’t been happy for a
long, long time. For a long time now dad’s been doing things I couldn’t
tell you. He’s been touching me and it’s getting worse. I can’t stay
anymore. I know you and I haven’t always gotten along sometimes, but
please don’t blame yourself. There isn’t anything you can do. I’m going
to make a whole new life in California. Maybe someday you’ll see me on
TV or in magazines. Don’t worry about me. Love, Mary Anne.”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You were right. I didn’t find anything. I’m
going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Do you ever consider… do you realize that
Mary may never come back?</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I think about it everyday. But, every
time the phone rings… every single time, I still think it’s her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s been six years.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: What am I supposed to do? Forget her?
Time heals all wounds, right? She’s all I think about, and I’ve learned
to live with that. But, you want the truth… the real truth? If I had a
choice… if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good
life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what
happened to her… … or her being dead and me knowing… I’d choose to
know.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Excuse me, I have to use your bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “Dear diary. I have a big math test
tomorrow. I have to get better grades. How come everybody does better
than me? Kathy doesn’t even study and she gets B’s. Two boys got in a
fight after school today. One boy knocked the other boy’s tooth out, at
least that’s what it looked like. His nose and mouth were bleeding all
over the place…”</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “… We’re reading The Great Gatsby in
English class. It’s the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties
and all his friends come around and party with him, but later when he
dies nobody comes to his funeral. Someone said there’s a movie about it,
but I looked in the video store and it wasn’t there.”</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “Dear diary. I started my first job
last week working part time at Price Mart department store…”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Is this pretty much it?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Just… just videos?</p>
<p><strong>pierced clerk</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pierced clerk</strong>: Fuck-head.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Big date tonight?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yeah… guess so.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Can I interest you in a battery
operated-vagina?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive
selling.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, it’s tempting, but no thanks.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s your call, but you’re gonna be sorry when
you’re in one of those everyday situations that call for a
battery-operated vagina and you don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll risk it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore. Have
a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Once you pick it up you can’t put it down.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Catchy title. What are you really reading?
Hard to believe that book’s got any parts worth highlighting.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Truman Capote.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I tear off the cover and paste this one on… You
know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Wouldn’t want to embarrass yourself in front
of your fellow perverts.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Might get drummed out of the pornographer’s
union, and then where would I be?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hi, honey, how are you? How’s Cindy? The way
it’s going I’m about ready to pack my bags…</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: … I’ve got a feeling the person I’m
looking for came out here and got swallowed up by the place.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s voice</strong>: Come back now. Just drop it and come
back…</p>
<p><strong>welles’ voice</strong>: I would if I could. I’ll be home
soon, believe me. It won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>amy’s voice</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I miss you too. I love you very much. Give
Cinderella a kiss for me and tell her I love her, alright?
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Came back for that battery-operated vagina,
right? Told you you would.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I need some information. Thought you might
be able to help.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thomas Welles. Nice picture.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll be outside having a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Cover me, Beth. I’m taking a break.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know what you’re looking for, mister,
but so we’re clear from the start, I’m straight.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How long you been working there?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Three, four years.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What’s your name, if you don’t mind me
asking?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Max.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, here’s the deal, Max. This thing I’m
on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff
that’s sold under the counter, illegally…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s not much illegal.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, whatever there is, whoever’s dealing,
however it’s done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you’ve got
that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re not a cop, are you? If I ask and you
are, you have to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m not a cop.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re a private eye. Like Shaft.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you
doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, there’s the thing; you’re not gonna
know anything about what I’m doing, but you can make some money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How much do you make now?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Four hundred a week, off the books.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, let’s pretend I live in the same
fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I’ll give
you six hundred for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sounds good, pops.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Here’s my number if you need it… When can
you start?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: See you then. Oh, and, don’t call me
“pops.”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: … Hello… ?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wake up, pops. Your education begins
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way
affiliated with law enforcement?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fuck you, Larry.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Are you a law enforcement… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>one dealer</strong>: We’re shutting down in fifteen minutes.
Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>angry dealer</strong>: Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick
shit. Buy five, get one free.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Anything harder?</p>
<p><strong>angry dealer</strong>: There’s nothing harder.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Snuff?</p>
<p><strong>angry dealer</strong>: What you see is what I got,
mister.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You know where I can get it? I have a lot of
money to spend.</p>
<p><strong>angry dealer</strong>: There ain’t no such thing as snuff.
Why don’t you fuck off?</p>
<p><strong>large man</strong>: You have to pay to come in here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’ve got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.
Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there’s mainstream
hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That’s hardcore. That
whole industry’s up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars.
They’re celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a
week. A week. They’ve even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves
pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they’re
lying. Somebody’s buying those videos. Somebody’s out there spending 900
million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It’s only gonna get
worse. More and more you’ll see perverse hardcore coming into the
mainstream, because that’s evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis
Presley’s wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv’s showing
girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know
what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren’t big enough after a
while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are
putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon,
Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse’ll be Hustler, Hustler’ll be
hardcore, and hardcore films’ll be medical films. People’ll be jerking
off to women laying around with open wounds. There’s nowhere else for it
to go.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Interesting theory.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What you saw tonight, we’re not talking about a
video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We’re talking about
stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Child pornography.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s two kinds of specialty product; legal
and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking,
fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites… it’s beyond hardcore, but legal.
This is the kind of hardcore where one guy’s going to look at it and
throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of
the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed
to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a
consenting or not? Step over that line, you’re into kiddie porn. Rape
films, but there aren’t many. I’ve never seen one.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Snuff films.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I heard you asking. That guy wasn’t yanking you
around. There’s no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What other ways are there to get illegal
films? Who do you see?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: First of all, basement sales like tonight
aren’t gonna last much longer. It’s too risky, one, and two,
everything’s going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough
patience can find anything he wants. It’s heaven for those degenerate
chicken-hawks. They’re swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their
modems can zap ’em. But, there’s still some weird shit under the counter
where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That’s local
underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are
zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go
out in the sun they don’t burn, they blister. Other than that, all I
know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.
Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate
wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you’re asking me who do
you go to to get illegal shit… who knows? That’s the whole point – the
seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and
cops can’t trace the deal. There’s ways to do it so nobody knows who
anybody is.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where are your parents?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know, where are yours?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I don’t mean any offense… but what are you
doing mixed up in all this?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are
you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You just strike me as smart enough to be
doing something else.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, I’m a real genius. What choices have I
got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn’t mean I
deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making
hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re telling me it doesn’t get to you?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You can’t sit there all day watching the parade
of losers that comes into that place without going numb. So what? Am I
gonna go off and be a race car driver? Go to Harvard? Run for President?
What about you, pops?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I see a ring on your finger. You have any
kids?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: A daughter.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in
Pennsylvania… what are you doing mixed up in all this?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: My husband had five cash accounts he
used to temporarily hold stock profits. Between November of 1991 and
March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He
wrote these himself…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: My husband never dealt with money
personally, certainly not cash.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m not positive this means anything.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: The checks were for odd amounts…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: One was for two hundred thousand, one
dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six
hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, I follow you so far…</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Totalled together, these five checks
from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: To the penny. Exactly one million
dollars in cash.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Hello… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Do you think the film could have cost
that much?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: For a human life… murder on film, no statute
of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I’d like you to overnight
me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Send it to me through the post office like
we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: You told me to look, so I looked.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re one hell of a detective,
Mrs. Christian.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Yes… I remember Mary</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You… you do? You’re sure? Please, Sister,
will you take another look, make sure…</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Yes. I remember her.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: She lived here for only about a month, if I
recall correctly. She didn’t return one night. She never came back. I
didn’t know what to think…</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Do you know what happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m trying to find out. She was a runaway.
I’m looking into it for her parents.</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Can you get that down for me?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: No, the next shelf… there…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: Those are her belongings.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Her belongings?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: That’s her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till
you showed me her picture.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Whatever possessed you to keep this all this
time?</p>
<p><strong>nun</strong>: She was the kindest, sweetest girl you’d ever
want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she’d be back.
After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.
Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it’s
appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll do what I can.</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: “Star light, star bright, First star
I’ve seen tonight, Wish I may, wish I might, Have this wish I wish

<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Celebrity Films.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is better. This will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, I’ll take it all.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Excellent. we accept MasterCard and
American Express.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Cash.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Alright. May I have your phone number,
area code first?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, you may not.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Okay. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: I’m required by state law to inform you
that, while it’s perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is
illegal for you to use them for any sort of…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it,
I’ll be on my way, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>salesperson</strong>: Certainly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … half a dozen. This is good stuff,
Jimbo…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know how my tapes sell. People eat this
stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: I had three jerkoffs trying to return
your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for
some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try
to fucking return it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe there’s something wrong with the
scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: The only thing wrong is the cheap,
softcore crap you’re peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Look, you cocksucker…</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Get together some upscale product where
the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Celebrity Films.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I know what you did.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I know what you did.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Who is this.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years
ago…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck are you.. ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You killed that girl and you put it on film.
You and your pals, you’re fucked. You fucked up real good.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Come on, Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: … come on…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: … Hello?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Dino, it’s Eddie… Eddie Poole…</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I just got a call… two seconds ago, some
motherfucker called… says he knows about the loop.</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do
you think I’m talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the
fucking loop…</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m telling you…</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that’s impossible.
Why are you bothering me with this… ?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Because somebody just fucking called me and
fucking laid it out!</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: There’s nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.
Think about it. There’s absolutely no way in this world to connect us to
anything. I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this
again I’m going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack
you open with a fucking rib spreader.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Dino…</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: Nobody knows anything.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That is you, isn’t it, Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>welles voice</strong>: … and your pals, you’re fucked…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Two one two.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What do you know about a guy called Dino
Velvet? Dino Velvet Films?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dino Velvet… yeah, he’s like the John Luc
Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: A weirdo making S+M films? Who’d have
thought it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and
fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Specialty product.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re learning.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where does he sell it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly,
but you can find it on the street if you look. He’ll also do
commissions, for enough money…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nothing illegal, it’s always borderline. Like
if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion
suit getting an enema from a…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Alright, I get the picture.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his
movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he’s
making art.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Well, I’m in New York now. What do you say
to flying out and giving me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m a working stiff, pops.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Take a vacation. I’ll pay you four hundred a
day, plus expenses.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You want me to come out there and play private
eye?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino
Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I’ll call back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: How are you? Having any luck?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I don’t know if luck’s the word. Are you
feeling alright?</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: I’ve been ordered into bed. The
doctor says I’ve gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I hope it’s nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Nothing more than a bother. Have you
any news for me?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ve made progress. I’m in Manhattan. Once a
few more pieces fall into place, I’ll drive to you and give you an
update.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: Fine…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ve got about five thousand left in cash,
but I’ll need another thirty, if you approve.</p>
<p><strong>mrs christian</strong>: How will I get it to you?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: If you have a pencil and paper, I’ll tell
you how to send it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t say it was gonna be this
luxurious.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s their Presidential Suite.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this
flea bag?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s cheap, and people know to mind their
own business. What have you got for me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Dino Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Max… wake up…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wha… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who is this, in the mask? Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s one of the lunatics Dino uses. He’s in a
bunch of these.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why? He have something to do with whatever
you’re into?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No… it’s nothing… that’s not him.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I told you, he’s one of Dino Velvet’s stock
players…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who is he, his name?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nobody knows his name. That’s his thing. He
always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself “Machine,”
that’s what they call him. Machine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: They say he’s half brain-dead from all the
steroids he’s using.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s a brutal motherfucker, man. He loves what
he does for a living.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You don’t need to be here.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn’t
go with you?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: You’re in the wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We’re looking for Mr. Velvet.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why don’t you tell him we’re here to give
him a large sum of money. If he’s not interested, we’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: You should leave now, before I have to remove
you.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet’s voice</strong>: Show them in, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You heard the boss, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Come in. Make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s an honor to meet you. Thank you for
seeing us.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: What can I do for you today?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’d like to commission a work. I’m a great
admirer of yours.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Flattering. And, who’s your colorful
little chum?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: A fellow investor.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re the only one still shooting film and
transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity
anymore… the grain, the gritty look you get.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Well, I’m glad you appreciate it. What
would you say is your favorite piece?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I know if I had to pick, it’d be “Choke,” or
“Devil.”</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: “Devil” frightened me as much as it excited
me, but I’d be hard pressed to choose a favorite.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You said something about money.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yes. What we’re looking for is rather
specific.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Five thousand now, five thousand on
delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large
breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your
artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: And they are?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I want to watch you work.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: I’ll consider it.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: And the other performer… it has to be that
monster you use… the man in the mask.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Machine.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: If it’s not him, there’s no deal.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: He might be interested… but it would
mean another five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We can do that.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Well, well, I’ll have to put my
thinking-cap on about all this. You’ll leave the money as a deposit?
Very good.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You have a beautiful face… the way the
light hits it. I’d like to take your picture. You don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’d rather you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m camera shy.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You trust me to keep your money, but
not to take your picture?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Those are two different kinds of trust.
Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: I’ll do this for you. Fifteen thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Machine’s in?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: He’s in. It will be his pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Be at 366 Hoyt Avenue, three o’clock,
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Brooklyn. Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s next?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m trying to figure that out myself. I have
to see Machine without his mask.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Still don’t want to tell me what you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: This is for you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s money. People use it to purchase goods
and services.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look… that’s awful generous and everything…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It’s not my money. The woman I got it from
is never going to give it a second thought. Let’s not make a big deal
out of this, okay? Go be a race car driver. Go run for President.
Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll see you around.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: There you are. Come join us.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You brought the money?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where are the women?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: They should be here any minute.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What are these for?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They’re just
props. Nice, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Machine and I were just talking about
knifes. The beauty of knifes…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: He was saying how fascinated he is by
their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be
so thin that it is almost nothing…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: So close to nothingness that it cuts
with minimum effort, because it’s so non-intrusive. Flesh is fooled. It
blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it’s too late, because the
knife’s already doing its pure, simple damage.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Ah, ours guests have arrived.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Mister Welles… would you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What are you… ?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Take out your gun!</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Slowly. Let me see it.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Empty the gun onto the table, very
carefully.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Look, I don’t know what this…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or
I’ll put this arrow through your throat.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.
Handcuff yourself to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Didn’t know what to make of you at
first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles. But, lo and
behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to
explain everything…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is the fucker? Motherfucker, doesn’t
look like anything…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Doesn’t look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You remember Mr. Longdale, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I remember him.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Fine idea.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You’re going to go get the film you
received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand. And
to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there’s an
incentive…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Look, he’s got nothing to do with this… let
him go…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Can you guess what I’m going to say
next?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He doesn’t know anything… he’s got nothing
to do with this…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Bring the film, or we kill him.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’ll get it. It’s in a safe deposit box, in
the city…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: How cooperative. Longdale will keep you
company.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Don’t let Longdale’s questionable
choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough
little holes in you, you’ll be just as dead… and so will Max.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Move it, dirtbag… !</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Do hurry.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You were the middleman, am I right? Old man
Christian wasn’t about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Wouldn’t exactly have been possible for a
man of his stature.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, he sent you, gave you the money, his
errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn’t like you could tell anyone
your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That’s the
beauty of lawyer/client privilege.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: That’s trust. Mr. Christian trusted me
implicitly.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk
everything. Would’ve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of
money.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: I was well compensated.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s why you got scared when
Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be
in that safe. How’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Never mind how I found you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Followed me… must have freaked out when you
saw me closing in on your buddies…</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: They’re no friends of mine.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Except, you’re willing commit murder with
them.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: None of this would be happening if you
would have left it alone. If you weren’t digging up a girl who died six
years ago. A girl no one even remembers.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her
mom remembers her.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You found these smut dealers and asked to
buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn’t
find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one…</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid
money to have her murdered.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Shut your mouth and drive!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut
her up? Tell me, because I really want to understand. Did he jerk off to
it? You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both
watched… ?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: You’re making me very angry.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Just tell me. Tell me some more of the
secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he
really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: You’re asking me why?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m asking.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: A man like Mr. Christian, a great man… all
his money, all his power… a man who attained everything there was to
attain…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost
girl getting butchered?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Isn’t it incredibly obvious?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Because he could. He did it because he
could. What other reason were you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: You’ve got four minutes till I call
Mr. Velvet and let him know there’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: May I show you to a booth…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, I’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: You almost went over your limit.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Give me the film.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’ll get it when we get there.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Give me the film.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Go ahead, shoot me. Then try driving to
Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck… !</p>
<p><strong>dino</strong>: I promised him to Machine.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: … sorry…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: First things first. You might want to
watch this, Mr. Welles…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t… please…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: And so it ends. It’s as if she never
existed.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Don’t blame yourself. You were in way
over your head.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Motherfuckers. Small time, motherfuckers… !
Tell me something…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie… but,
why’d the lawyer do it? Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?
One fuckload of money…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So, what are you all still doing small time,
huh? What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave
Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you
ever see… ?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: One million dollars, Dino. How much did he
tell you he had…</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Look at him. You think he played it square?
How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck’s he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Stay away from me.</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: What’s going on, Longdale? Did this
happen?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You sell us short, you fuck?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Stay back! You have a gun, Eddie, show it
to me. Now!</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Put it on the ground, kick it here…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You fucking lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Move back! All of you… move!</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: What were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Back off! Everything’s been taken care of,
and I’m leaving now…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You’re not going anywhere if you fucked
us, lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us
all, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You betrayed us.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Keep back!</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: You’re not gonna live through this.</p>
<p><strong>longdale</strong>: Our business is done, I’m leaving, no
one’s going to stop me…</p>
<p><strong>dino velvet</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: NO!</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: He’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: No, no, no… please, don’t kill me… please…
!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do him good.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Back off, Eddie…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Stop Eddie!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I swear to Christ I’ll shoot you in the
back… !</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Come back, or I put a hole in him.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You might make it to your gun, but not
before I shoot Machine. And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I
don’t kill him, right after he kills me, he’s gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Take off the mask.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Take it off!</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: You got one bullet.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: The only choice you have now, is which one
of us kills you.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Get the gun!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Amy, it’s me. Listen very carefully..</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tom? Where have you been… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of
the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s wrong? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m okay. Please, honey, I can’t explain.
Don’t use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I’m on my way. I’ll be
back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get
there</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: … What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Just do it, Amy, please, go.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Honey… ?</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Nothing like getting home after a rough
day. Home sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Walk away. Pack your bags, put the wife and
kid in the car and find a place to hide. If you’re lucky, you’ll never
see me again.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I don’t know if I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: I know who you are. I know where you live.
I know everything I need to know to find you. Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m okay, honey, I’m okay. Are you
alright?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What’s going on, Tom? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I can’t tell you, Amy. You know I can’t. You
have to trust me…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tom…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: It has to be this way for now. It won’t be
long.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why haven’t you called? Why don’t you answer
your phone?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I don’t know. I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re sorry? What was I supposed to think?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You owe me an explanation. You can’t treat me
like this.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I wanted to call. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You couldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No, I don’t, because you’re not telling me
anything!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I was in hell. If I called you… if I heard
your voice… it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn’t do
that.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You should have.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Amy, I’m not going to let anything happen to
us.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of
a bitch, you don’t have any idea what you’re putting me through…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I don’t know what to say</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re killing me…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What was I supposed to think happened to
you?!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Amy…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: We have to stay here a few days. I’ll get
more clothing from the house if I can. I’m sorry. We’re going to be
okay.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Who are you calling?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mrs. Christian.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: She’s all I’ve got. She’s the only
witness.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tom… she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in
the paper…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I just talked to her.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How could you not know?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Promise you’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Promise you won’t go back there, wherever
you were. Whatever it was, forget it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Promise me.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Put your hands on your head.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Put your hands behind your head, lock your
finger together, get down on your knees.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I owe you a few.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t bore me with that bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How’d you find me here?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Starting to recognize a pattern?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Who is Machine?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I want his name.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I told you, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I will never get tired of hurting you,
Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak
for? He was Dino’s boy, not mine. He shows up with his mask on, leaves
with his mask on. Nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Okay, we’ll come back to that. So, six years
ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however
he does it. It’s Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you,
entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, the fucking lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Told him you could get him a snuff film.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: How much did he pay you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thirty thousand each, that fucking
cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s all? Thirty each. That’s all it took
for you to murder her?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It was a lot of fucking money.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: So… you brought Dino in, and he brought
Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an
ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What did you do, knock her out, shoot her
up… ?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What the fuck do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I want to know. I want to know exactly what
you did to her!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fuck you then, you want to know? I talked her
up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star. I
told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I’m doing that, I
got her a soda and dropped a mickey. When it was dark enough, I rang
Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and
we went and we fucking did it. That’s what happened. She’s dead. She’s
been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You wanted to know, now you know.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s right, motherfucker, cut me loose. Be
a man.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Show me!</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Show me where you did it, on the map,
exactly where you did it.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Because we’re going there.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are we doing here?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That night… you didn’t have to be in the
room, but you were. Why? Why did you watch?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know. I felt like it. I never saw
anyone get done before.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I
care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was
doing for money.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw
the loop…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Nobody saw you bring her in?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There wasn’t nobody around. This place was a
shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like
groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic,
put film in the camera and Machine went to work.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: What did you do with her body?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in
the woods.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What are you thinking you’re gonna do… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where do you think you’re taking this, huh?
Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl’s death? Gonna make
everything right with the world? How you gonna do that… ?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You can’t go to the cops. All you can do is
cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You got absolute zero.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Show me where you buried her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t know… … out there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Where? Show me where.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I fucking don’t know. What do you think… we
weren’t burying treasure. We didn’t pace it out so we could come back
and get it. We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as
mine.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ll never find her. Nobody ever will, and
even if they did, it doesn’t mean nothing. Bring in the cops, bring in
the F.B.I., fuck ’em all. Without the film, it never happened. Don’t you
get it? It’s over. You can’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I can kill you. I can leave you out here,
just like you left her.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Don’t think I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don’t
have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it’s so easy?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Easy enough for you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I never killed anyone.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s right, you just stood there and
watched, because you “felt like it.” Almost makes you worse.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What do you want? You want me to fall to my
knees and start crying like a baby… ?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where you going? You’re the one with the gun.
Aren’t I defenseless enough? Come on…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Go ahead and kill me. Kill me with that gun,
your gun, right, registered in your name? Dig the hole yourself, with
your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it. Fucking do
it!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You pussy.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fucking pussy!</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Hello… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Mrs. Mathews? It’s Thomas. Do you remember,
I was there a few weeks ago… asking about your daughter…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: I remember. You just left…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I have to tell you something. It won’t be
easy for you to hear. It’s about your daughter… Mary Anne… When I… when
I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware. If you
read it, you’ll know what I’m telling you is true…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: What are you talking about… ?</p>

wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: What… ?</p>

dead.</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Who is this… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Someone… some men, they took your daughter
and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room… they did
terrible things to her…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: They brought her into the room… one man, he
put a knife to her throat and he raped her…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He raped her and…and…and he murdered her…he
cut her up with knifes…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: No… no… no…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: They killed her, and they took her out in
the forest somewhere and they buried her…</p>
<p><strong>mrs mathews</strong>: Why… why are you doing this to me…
?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I’m sorry.
It happened a month after she ran away. She’s been dead all this
time…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m so sorry… there wasn’t
anything anyone could do…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed through
to Kennedy. Gate 32B.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Mr. Welles?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Gate 32B.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello, can you connect me with the duty
nurse? Hello, this is Lieutenant Anderson down here in the Thirteenth
Precinct. I’ve got a helluva problem I was hoping you could give me a
hand with. We had a stabbing incident a couple of days ago, and it looks
like the supposed victim gave us a false name and address. Can you tell
me if you had an adult male with an abdominal wound in you ER in the
last forty-eight hours? You’d remember this guy; a body- builder, real
big guy, five foot eleven, with acne all over his chest and back…
Alright, thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: … guy sticks out like a sore thumb. Five
foot ten or eleven, body-builder, bad acne… Okay, thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: … abdominal wound. You’d know him if you saw
him…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: He’s a body-builder, stands just under six
feet…</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: That’s right… covered in acne. That’s him,
that’s the guy. Listen, we, uh… we think he filed a bogus report on this
stabbing, gave us a false name and address… Yes, I’ll hold.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Yes… yes. Christopher Higgins. Thirty-
fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street. Where? Astoria, Queens.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Hello?! Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tom?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: How much forgiveness do you think I have in
me?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I can’t talk about it yet… not yet.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: Why… why… ?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Tom… ?</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: I have to tell you… I have to tell you what
happened. I have to tell you everything, but we can’t tell anyone else.
No one else can ever know.</p>
<p><strong>welles</strong>: You’re all I’ve got. You’re all I’ve ever
had. You’re the only one who can save me.</p>
