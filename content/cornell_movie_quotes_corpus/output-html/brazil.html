<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Deputy minister, what do you believe is
behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of
people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They
just can’t stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just
play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: In fact, killing people -</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: - In fact, killing people - they’d get a
lot more out of life.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to
those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become
too large and unwieldy …?</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: David … in a free society information is
the name of the game. You can’t win the game if you’re a man short.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: And the cost of it all, Deputy
Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce …</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: I understand this concern on behalf of the
tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective
service.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: That is why we always insist on the
principle of Information Retrieval Charges. These terrorists are not
pulling their weight, and it’s absolutely right and fair that those
found guilty should pay for their periods of detention and the
Information Retrieval Procedures used in their interrogation.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Do you think that the government is
winning the battle against terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: On yes. Our morale is much higher than
theirs, we’re fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and
pretty consistently knocking them for six. I’d say they’re nearly out of
the game.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: But the bombing campaign is now in its
thirteenth year …</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Beginner’s luck.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Thank you very much, Deputy
Minister.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Thank you, David … and a very merry
Christmas to you all.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: There, that’s enough for tonight. He
won’t come Xmas Eve if you don’t get plenty of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: Father Christmas can’t come if we
haven’t got a chimney.</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: You’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: How will he get down from upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>boy buttle</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: You’ve come …</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I hereby inform you under powers entrusted
to me under Section 47, Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number 438476, that
Mr Buttle, Archibald, residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri La Towers,
has been invited to assist the Ministry of Information with certain
enquiries, the nature of which may be ascertained on completion of
application form BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this date, and that he
is liable to certain obligations as specified in Council Order 173497,
including financial restitutions which may or may not be incurred if
Information Retrieval procedures beyond those incorporated in Article 7
subsections 8, 10 &amp; 32 are required to elicit information leading to
permanent arrest - notification of which will he served with the time
period of 5 working days as stipulated by law. In that instance the
detainee will be debited without further notice through central banking
procedures without prejudice until and unless at such a time when
re-imbursement procedures may be instituted by you or third parties on
completion of a re-imbursement form RB/CZ/907/X …</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: thick book of pink receipts</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: What? where have you taken him?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: thank you. Same again please. Just there.
Press harder his time. Good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: What is this all about?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: That’s your receipt for your husband.
Thank you. And this is my receipt for your receipt.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mrs Buttle, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Eh! Eh! Eh! We’re Department of Works!
Department of Works up here! Careful with those bloody things!</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Don’t take any notice, love, it’s their
training makes them like animals. Best in the world, though.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t you worry love, we’ll have everything
shipshape in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: That’s it. Nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s Buttle downstairs who can worry,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: There must be some mistake … Mr Buttle’s
harmless…</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We don’t make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bloody typical, they’ve gone back to metric
without telling us</p>
<p><strong>mr kurtzman</strong>: Mr Lowry, will you step in here
please?</p>
<p><strong>mr kurtzman</strong>: Does anyone know where Lowry is?</p>
<p><strong>mr kurtzman</strong>: Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello … What … what? Oh … Mr Kurtzman! … You’re
up late. Oh, is it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The electronics here are up the spout. Yours
too, sir? Don’t worry sir - I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Long time no see!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of
Information Retrieval … I don’t expect to see you slumming in Records -
what’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Problem? - No problem - yes, everything’s
going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects,
Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I’m on Security Level
Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn’t be
better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You sound worried.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Me? - if I’m worried about anyone, it’s you.
What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry. Nothing. See you - I’m going to be
late.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You are late.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Even later.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sam, your life is going wrong - let your
friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level
worth a damn, it’s impossible to get noticed -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful -
remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Triplets.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Really? - God, how time flies!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I want to report a wrongful arrest.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: You want Information Adjustments. Different
department.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I’ve been to Information Adjustments. They
sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Have you got an Arrest Receipt?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Is it stamped?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Stamped?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: No, there’s no stamp on it. You see! I can’t
give you the form until it’s stamped.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Where do I get it stamped?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Information Adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Perhaps the machine’s on the blink! It
keeps picking up old films. That can’t he right, can it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s not the machine. There’s a mismatch on the
personnel code numbers… Ah there we go! That’s a B58/732 when it should
be a T47/215 … Tuttle … he should have �31.06, debited against his
account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Oh my God, a mistake!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s not our mistake!</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Isn’t it? Whose is it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Information Retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Oh, good!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Expediting has put in for electrical procedures
in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has
invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: What a relief! I don’t know what I’d do if
you ever got promoted.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: But if they did promote you</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve told you before. I’d turn it down.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Would you really, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: You’ve been promoted.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: It’s your mother isn’t it? Pulling strings
again.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What a BITCH!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs Lowry,
we’ll make a little tuck here … and there …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I just wish you would stop interfering, mother!
I don’t want promotion. I’m happy where I am.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No you’re not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you
- he never had your brains but he’s got the ambition. You haven’t got
the ambition but luckily you’ve got me. And Mr Helpmann. Mr Helpmann was
very close -</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now, Mrs Lowry, don’t get upset Please wait
in reception, Mr Lowry, you’re giving her wrinkles.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You see!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now Mrs Lowry, try to relax. You must trust
me. I’ll make you twenty years younger …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Huh!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: … twenty-five if we just drain the excess
fluid from the pouches …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Dr Jaffe, you’re a genius. Would you like to
be Surgeon General? Four Star. I know everybody.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well they won’t know you when I’ve finished
with you.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: First we must eliminate the excess derma …
so! … Then the flaccid tissues under the eyes … And now the forehead …
Zip! I lift the wrinkles and worry lines right up into the wi- into the
hairline, comme ca …</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And now the template … There … there … there
… Now a bit of sticky … There we go! Already she is twice as beautiful
as she was before - voila!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My God, it works.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor
father. He was very close to me. Still is. He’ll take you under his wing
at Information Retrieval. You’ll like it when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re not listening, mother.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s a present for my son.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I hope you like it. It’s very exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s something for executives.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d</strong>: Madam Lowry, how exquisite to see you
again. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: I’m sorry but …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You remember Samuel, my son.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Oh, but of course …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’re meeting Mrs Terrain.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are we?</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Ah yes, the lady is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mother, I thought we were going to be able to
talk …. Oh God, she’s got what’s he name with her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Ida! Sam!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Alma, how are you? You’re looking wonderful!
Hello, Shirley.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Salt?</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Not yet. Happy Christmas, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sorry we’re late. Shall we order? Get it out
of the way. What are you going to have Alma?</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: I can’t make up my mind whether to have
a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Between you and me, Madam, today the number
two.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you
going to have?</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Between you and me, Mademoiselle, today the
number one. Madam Lowry?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight,
please.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say
so. Monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A steak, please. Rare. Mother, I need to …</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Monsieur. Quel numero.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know which numero.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Numero, trois.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Alma, you wicked thing … you’ve started your
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: You noticed. I must tell you all about
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mother, will you listen to</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: remembers who’s ordered</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: It’s too exciting. I’ve left Dr Jaffe
and gone to Dr. Chapman.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Numero deux, duck a l’orange.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: The acid man?</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Really, Ida, just because his
techniques are revolutionary … I don’t go around calling Dr Jaffe the
knife man.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Numero une, crevettes � la mayonaaise.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m sorry Alma, I didn’t mean to sound so
…</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: That’s all right Ida … it’s just that
he’s such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude … so primitive.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Numero trois, steak. Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon
appetit.</p>
<p><strong>all but sam</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Acid on the other hand, can be used for
such wonderfully subtle shading, such delicate nuances - just like a
Rembrant etching … and it’s so much quicker. Why, if it weren’t for a
teensy-weensy complication - the doctor said it could have happened to
anyone - I would have had these bandages off yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: her mother’s attention and</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What were we saying?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This isn’t rare!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for
Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift
tokens.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Oh, that sounds marvellous.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, they’re good at any doctor’s and at
many of the major hospitals - and they’re accepted for gynecological
complications including Caesarian section.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look - please - I’m sorry - but honestly,
mother, this is -</p>
<p><strong>mother.</strong>: I quite agree! - It’s impossible!</p>
<p><strong>maitre d</strong>: I am sorry, Madam … I don’t know what to
say … this very rarely happens to us - I’ll do what I can straight
away</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Really, Sam - when are you going to do
something about these terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? Now? It’s my lunch hour.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Actually, Alma, that’s one of the little
things I was dying to tell you … Sam’s been promoted to Information
Retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Oh that’s wonderful! Congratulations
Sam…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: You can show those fucking murderous
bastards a thing or two.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Shirley!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Stop this! I’m not being promoted. I’m not
going to Information Retrieval! If I want you to stick your oar in,
mother, I’ll tell you where to stick it!</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: Pepper…?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look - I’ve got to get back -</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sam … you haven’t had dessert.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’ t want dessert. I don’t want
promotion. I don’t want anything.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Don’t be childish, Samuel. Of course you
want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m taking you to a safe place. A place where
they will never be able to get at us … ever.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There’s no way they can approach us without
being seen. You’re safe here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello - Central Services - I’m at 579B Block
l9, Northwestern Section D - that’s exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at
the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I’ve got trouble with the air-
conditioning</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Thank you or calling Central Services.
am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take
service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day -
this has not been a recording, incident-</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is an emergency!</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Thank you for calling Central Services.
I am sorry, due -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, but. I’ve got to have a heating
engineer</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Thank you for calling Cen -</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: Ah ha … there you are, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? How do you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: We know everything here. This is the Storeroom
of Knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then perhaps you can help me. I’ve lost someone
who …</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: We know that too. You’ve come to the right
place.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: Oh, yes. We’ve got everything here. Every bit
of knowledge, wisdom, learning … every experience, every thought neatly
filed away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? You mean you’ve got …</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: Well not exactly. But, if you help us we’ll
help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day … but, tomorrow is
another one</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: You must save the day.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: This is the Sword Of Truth … and this the
Helmet Of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: And this. completes the outfit.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: It won’t be pleasant but, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello … hello …</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Hello. Mr Lowry?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Put the phone down and your hands
up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I
can see them.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is this? Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your
service.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Ha!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But … I called Central Services.</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: They’re a bit overworked these days. Luckily
I intercepted your call.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait a minute, what was that business with the
gun?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: A little precaution, sir. I’ve had traps set
for me before now. There are people in Central Services who’d love to
get their hands on Harry Tuttle.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you saying this is illegal?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Well, yes … and no. Officially, only Central
Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff … Could you hold
these.</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: … but, with all the new rules and
regulations … unncgh, c’mon, c’mon … they can’t get decent staff any
more … so … they tend to turn a blind eye … as long as I’m careful. …
Mind you, if ever they could prove I’d been working on their equipment …
well, that’s a different matter … up a bit with the torch, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry. wouldn’t it be easier just to work for
Central Services?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Couldn’t stand the pa - ah - we’re getting
warm -</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The pace?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: The paperwork, couldn’t stand the paperwork.
Over to the left please, if you don’t mind sir. Hold it there. Yes,
there’s more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read
this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours
could be on fire and I couldn’t even turn on the kitchen tap without
filling in a 27B/6…. Bloody paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well I suppose one has to expect a certain
amount</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Why? I came into this game for adventure -
go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there’s trouble, a
man alone. Now they’ve got the whole country sectioned of and you can’t
move without a form. I’m the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it! There’s
your problem.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: No. But I can bypass it with one of
these</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Are you expecting anyone?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Central Services.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ervices.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh - what? - I …</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: You telephone, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …elephoned sir.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Trouble with your air-conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ditioning.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, not at all. I mean, it’s all right. It’s
fixed.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Fixed?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: Fixed?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I mean it fixed itself.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Fixed itself.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ixed itself.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Machines don’t fix themselves.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … fix themselves.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: He’s tampered with it, Dowser.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ampered. with it, Spoor.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, I’m sorry about your wasted journey</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: I think we’d better have a look.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … have a look.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Just a minute!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Have you got a 27B/6?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Now look what you’ve done to him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Have you got one or haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Not … as such …</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: But we can get one.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: It’s all right, Terry, it’s all right,
everything’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’m a bit of a stickler for
paper work. Where would we be if we didn’t follow the correct
procedures?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: We’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …Be back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Thanks, Lowry, you’re a good man in a tight
corner.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Listen .. um … I don’t want to get involved in
any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to
know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald
Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn’t by any chance be -</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: My friends call me Harry. Information
Retrieval, eh? Interesting!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do they want you or?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you very much. How much will it…?</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: On the house. You did me a favor. Check the
corridor.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: All clear.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hey that’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>neighbour</strong>: I think Kurtzman getting is
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What have we got on today?</p>
<p><strong>neighbour</strong>: Casablanca.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a moment
please.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Thank God you’re here! We’re in terrible
trouble! Look at this! Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A cheque.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: The refund for Tuttle!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tuttle?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: I mean, Buttle! It’s been confusion from
the word go! He’s been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and
someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve never seen a Ministry cheque before.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: We’ve got to get rid of it! There’s been a
balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they’ll jump on whoever’s
holding the cheque!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle.
It’s his cheque.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: I’ve tried that! Population Census have
got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer
has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him
down as inoperative … Security has him down as excised., Admin have him
down as completed</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He is dead.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Dead! Oh no! That’s terrible! We’ll never
get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Try next of kin.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Next of kin!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What’s the
number on the cheque?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Into memory. Now … Central Banking … Buttle,
Veronica … Deposit</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Please don’t come back! Please don’t come
back!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Problem. She doesn’t have a bank account.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Well, that’s it! I may as well go and hang
myself! This sort of thing couldn’t have happened before the stupid
seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch! The bastards! Ow! Perhaps we can lose it …
behind the filing cabinet … or destroy it … burn it … eat it …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’d never get away with it. Besides, you
can’t do that to somebody’s refund. It’s Christmas. There is one more
option.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque,
tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet
shop.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: That’s brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ll do it for you. Authorise the cheque.
What’s the address?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Here. What do I do next?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Call the motor pool and authorise personal
transport.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How
do I authorize a cheque?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you’ve
got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Oh God! I think I’ve broken a bone. What a
pathetic thing I am.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: You are good to me Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t mention it. See you later.</p>
<p><strong>35 ext. motorway tunnel day 35</strong>: CUT to SAM at the
wheel of the little car, beetling along in a seemingly endless,
tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and aft by huge buses, lorries and other
carriers which literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: … We interrupt this programme to bring you
news of a terrorist bombing at the …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Excuse me. Can you tell me …</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Eff off.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. corridor day 39</strong>: CUT to SAM coming
breathlessly out of the stairwell. On the wall next to it is the number
37. Walking down the corridor he looks at the number and starts to
knock, but then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to
knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles for knocking
on the door frame a bit feebly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mrs Buttle Uh, Mrs Buttle?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mrs Buttle …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you Mrs Buttle?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry. I’m from the
Ministry of Information. I’ve come to give you a cheque.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s a refund … I’m afraid there was a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: Mistake?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes. Not my department … I’m only records. It
seems that Mr Buttle was overcharged by Information Retrieval. I don’t
think they usually make mistakes … but, er … I suppose we’re all
human.</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: My husband’s dead, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Er … I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is
always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you
have any complaints which you’d like to make, I’d be more than happy to
send you the appropriate forms.</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: What have you done with his body?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Um …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid I don’t
know anything about it … I’m really just delivering the cheque. Er … If
you wouldn’t mind signing these receipts I’ll go and leave you in
peace.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Uh …</p>
<p><strong>mrs buttle</strong>: He hadn’t done anything … He was good …
What have you done with his body?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s you … it’s you …</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Mrs Buttle, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait! Stop! Come back!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Girl … fair hair …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait! It was nothing to do with me!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: Her name is Jill.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? …Jill? Jill who? Jill who?</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: Layton.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill Layton … You’re a very good little girl.
What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>girl buttle</strong>: I’m waiting for my daddy.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He will be pleased when he comes home.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Oh … Sam. I’ve had the transport pool onto
me … You don’t know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing
do you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A “personnel” transporter? They’ve got it
wrong. I had a personal transporter. I’ll do the paperwork tomorrow
-</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Is it all right about Mrs Buttle’s
cheque?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I delivered it.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Can I forget it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: What a relief! I shall probably have
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Damn! Blast!</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t happen to know how I can get around
an IRQ/3 do you?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: All information on 3rd Level Suspects is
classified.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: All enquiries to Information Retrieval.
Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the
time they want something from us …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve go to accept that promotion to get behind
this, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Yes. NO! You can’t! You’ve only just
turned it down!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I never signed the form.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: I did it for you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: It’s what you wanted isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes … No … I don’t, know.</p>
<p><strong>kurtzman</strong>: Come on, before they turn the lights
out.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What the - ? How did you - ?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Emergency procedures.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ergency procedures.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I haven’t got an emergency. Get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Sign here please.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: It’s a 27B/6, what did you think it was?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Haven’t you got a ballpoint?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Now where’s he got to? Dowser!</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: What have you got there?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: Got there!</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Mumble … mumble … mumble … Tuttle</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: Mumble … Tuttle …</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Tuttle! … mumble! You’ve had that scab Tuttle
here, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …aven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Who fixed your ducts?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …your ducts?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I fixed it myself.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Oh yeh? Where’d you get this from eh out yer
nostril?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …Yer nostril?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Central Services don’t take kindly to
sabotage!</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …sabotage!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hang on! Wait a minute! You can’t just go and
leave it like this!</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Why not? All you’ve got to do is blow yer
nose and fix it, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …ven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: You’re putting your talents to very odd use
Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …sod you, stupid twit.</p>
<p><strong>mr kurtzman of the mound</strong>: Don’t go! It’s a trap!
She’s not what she seems.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Er … Thanks …</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: It’s reply paid.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh … Thank you very much, mother, but actually
-</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You don’t have to sing it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, right …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Aren’t you a bit late? - the party started half
an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Yes, I know. It’s the backlog, everybody
complains. Was it all right otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, it was … very nice … thank you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you mind if I use your bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sam, I’m so glad you came. Do come in.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mother? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: slightly askance at his</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is Mr Helpmann here?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It seems you’re the first person ever to
turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Actually, I’ve decided …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh, Louis! You know Sam.</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: Can you believe it?! Just me and my little
knife! Snip - snip - slice - slice - Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Congratulations …</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: And this is just the beginning!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: Chirst yes, you’ve seen her with her
clothes off. Faces are a doddle compared to tits and arse. No
hairline.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Really, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>beefcake</strong>: I’ve been looking everywhere for you,
Ida.</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: Ah, dear boy … And what do you think of
your mother now?</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: Excuse me, Dr Chapman, did you say
something?</p>
<p><strong>dr chapman</strong>: That technique … I’ve tried it. A nice
effect. But highly unstable. In six months she’ll look like Grandma
Moses.</p>
<p><strong>dr jaffe</strong>: Now see here, Chapman. At least mine don’t
look like they’ve been mugged.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Whatever happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: There was a slight complication.
Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine.
Nothing to worry about. He’s promised me I’ll have these bandages off in
a …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Actually, there’s someone I want to meet …</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: I know, I know …!</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Here we are! I’m going to leave you two
lovebirds in peace.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I … uh …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Can I get you a drink, Shirley?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look … Shirley … your mother … and my mother …
they seem to have got the idea … I mean, I’m terribly flattered, of
course, but, um, the thing is, I don’t want you to be under any false
…</p>
<p><strong>shirley</strong>: {struggling into speech</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You remember Alison?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello, Alison. You look different.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Well, I’m two years older.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And she’s been to Dr. Jaffe!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She doesn’t like me telling anyone but she’s
pleased as anything really.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Er, I knew you looked different.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remember how they used to stick out?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if
they were real.</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: What, my ears?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Your ears?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Dr. Jaffe has pinned her ears back.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were
false.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mr Helpmann!</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Hello, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You remember my wife … Alis -</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Of course. Barbara isn’t it? How are
you?</p>
<p><strong>alison</strong>: Um …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Alison that she mustn’t</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Fine, thank you. Hello, Sam. Ida said you
might be here. Have you got a minute? Would you excuse us?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course …. of course … Come on Alison -
Barbara</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Thanks very much Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: If I can help you …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry …</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Your father and I were very close. Of
course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends … especially
after the bombing and I keep his name alive at the office every day.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: It’s as though he’s there speaking to me -
“’ere I am, J.H.!” The ghost in the machine.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: I know he would have wanted me to help you
… And I promised your mother I’d take you onto the team at information
Retrieval. But I gather that …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Helpmann. I’ve changed my mind. I’d like to
accept the transfer - am I too late?</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Too late? That’s for me to say.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well … well, I …</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Welcome to Information Retrieval!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr

<p><strong>porter</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My I.D. cards.</p>

welcome to the team.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: No, you can’t have any more chairs! There’s
only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on! Oh … er, sorry.
Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sam Lowry.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Ah, yes, you’re the new boy from next door, ha
ha! My name’s Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah. Would you mind if I borrowed your computer
console?</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ll bring it back in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: You want to take my console into your
office?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: I’ll tell you what …. You tell me what and
I’ll do it for. I’m a bit of a whizz on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Alright. There’s someone I want to check out. A
woman called Gillian Layton.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: A woman eh? I see.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I
need an address or a place of work or something</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: This is your dream girl, is it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? Look, let me use the console for a few
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: You must be joking - When there’s a woman
involved - there’s no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Sod it, it’s broken!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You haven’t switched it on.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Oh - yes. Look you’re putting me off, standing
there! Go back to your office and I’ll give you a knock when I’ve
finished.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Go on. I’m not going to elope with her.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. lime’s office day 67</strong>: SAM enters. LIME is
standing, proudly holding out a sheet of paper.</p>

hair, black, weight, one hundred and twenty-one pounds, distinguishing
marks, blemish on right shoulder, scar on left elbow</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: It’s a start isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But I already knew this!</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Best to take it slowly where some women are
concerned.</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Hey - that’s my desk!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Gillian Layton - Suspect S/5173. Truck driver!
All enquiries, reference officer 412/L - Room 5001. That’s what I wanted
to know. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Ah, Lowry, glad I caught you … No, send it
back for … Are you settling down? … I want this order rescinded …
There’s a query on a personnel transporter you took out from the pool …
Tell them no, tell them yes, … or was it a personnel carrier you took
out from transportation … Send that up to Security … Some kind of
eight-wheel- half-track, was it? … Tell him I want to see him … Send
round the paperwork, Lowry … Arrange a conference on that one … Anyway,
tidy it up, Lowry, there’s a good chap - get a new suit. Did you want
the lift?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>charlady</strong>: Beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>typist</strong>: It won’t be long now.</p>
<p><strong>on typewriter</strong>: AHHHH, Oh God … No, don’t … UHH,

<p><strong>typist</strong>: You can go in now.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?</p>

were coming aboard - congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: For my sins. Are you settling in alright?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Terrific. I’m really glad you dropped by.
Unfortunately, I don’t have any time right now I’ve got a queue of
customers to deal with - er, why don’t we have a drink tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t want to take up your time now, but I
was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It’s a
security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to
refer to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: OK. Come back this afternoon, about four
o’clock. If you give me the number of the case, I’ll have the dossier
here waiting. My tailor,… well worth the investment.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve got numbers all over these - I’m not sure
which is the one you want.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: picture of Jill over Sam’s</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You
only moved in today and you’re already hot on the bloody trail.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Am I?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please, Sam, we’re going to have to be open to
each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it’ll
be at my expense.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How much do you know?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Enough though, eh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not really, no.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: OK. OK. Let’s not fence around … This is the
situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused
two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: B58/732, that’s A. Buttle isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Christ! You do know it all!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, no, I don’t. I’m just beginning Honestly.
Sorry, carry on.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with
T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it’s a joke! Somebody should be shot for
that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You got the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I did not get the wrong man. I got the right
man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him,
on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the
confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn’t
have done.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You killed him?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down
to avoid that event but Buttle’s heart condition did not appear on
Tuttle’s file. Don’t think I’m dismissing this business, Sam. I’ve lost
a week’s sleep over it already.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m sure you have</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There are some real bastards in this
department who don’t mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but
thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent
civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We’ve got the upper hand
for the moment, but they’re waiting for us to slip up, and a little
slip- up like this is just the chance they’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So how …?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What I’ve got to do now is pick up Tuttle,
interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading
to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What has Tuttle done?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We suspect him of freelance subversion.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s a freelance subversive?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick
ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now,
fortunately, we’re nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be
when I get this Layton woman under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s she done?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You didn’t know as much about this business as
you pretended to, did you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Er … no.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Very smart.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Er … but I would’ve found out anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Tell me about Layton.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle
arrest - and since then she’s been making wild allegations, obviously
trying to exploit the situation - she’s working for somebody, and she’s
not working for us.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah … thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened
to live above the Buttles, and …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: wife and kids from his</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Right. Er, you’re not going to keep calling her
Barbara, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Barbara’s a perfectly good name, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she’s just
trying to help the Buttle family.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why? Hell, not for any reason …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t follow you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Out of kindness.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Kindness? What’s the purpose behind this line
of enquiry?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So what are you going to do about her?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Get her out of circulation - I’ve put her on
the detention list.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You mean you’re going to invite her in so that
she can spill the beans inside the department?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I … Good point. What do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Let me try to get to her. I’ll deactivate
her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What does that mean? I don’t want to be
involved in anything unsavoury.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Trust me. You do trust me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course. We went to school together. You’re
my oldest friend.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And you’re mine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re the only person I can trust.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then we’d better keep this business just
between the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right! Just between as and the Security
Forces.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They weren’t at school with us.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But, I’ve already put her on the search and
detain list.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Take her off the list.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There’s no procedure for that until she’s been
arrested.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Say it was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We don’t make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, I’d better get out there and try to get
to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Er … alright. For Christ’s sake don’t lose it.
Here, you’d better sign for it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thanks, Jack. I’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sam … we’re proud to have you at Information
Retrieval. Merry Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: But you’ve stamped this form before! Why won’t
you stamp it now?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: You’ve just said yourself, Miss, we’ve
already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, you - get out of there.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What do you think you’re doing … that’s the
Deputy Minister’s lift.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hold on, sonny … let’s see your</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit … it’s here somewhere. My name’s Lowry,
Sam Lowry - Expediting … can’t this wait?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No, sir … I’m going to have to file a report
on this. Now … what date is it today?…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sorry, it’ll have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Stop!! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’re a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive,
fascist moron aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You think these are tits don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I bet you’d like to touch them?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well don’t. You’re looking at twenty pounds of
high explosive! And if you don’t stamp this form I’m going to blow the
place up!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: STOP! Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well done … uh … excellent work … quick
thinking. I’ll take charge of her now …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come with me, please.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who are you? Let go!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t look back! Act naturally!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: How can I act naturally, when you’ve trying to
break my arm?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ow! That hurt!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>voice from behind</strong>: STOP! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, God … no!</p>
<p><strong>old lady</strong>: Can’t you read english? You illiterate
foreign pig! You come here from your own filthy country and think you
can mess our streets up! You should be fried alive, you dirty verminous
… etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>other guard</strong>: Hey, you shouldn’t be reading that it’s
classified.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well done, that’s it … Let’s go! Vrmmm.
Vrmmm.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What are you doing? For Christ’s sake! Get
moving!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sam Lowry. Hello. This sounds insane, I know,
but I’ve been dreaming about you. Even before I saw you you were in my
dreams. Weird isn’t it. I mean … I don’t know what it means … but it
might mean something … mightn’t it? I hope so. Anyway you’re in danger
and I think we should get out of here, now, quick! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Bloody hell! Do as I say!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Alright! Alright! Alright! I’m Information
Retrieval Officer - DZ/015, and I’m arresting you for - your own good!
Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Them?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Us. Them. I don’t know … just get going.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t litter my cab!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: … This is amazing … for me … being here with
you. I mean, in my dreams you …</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I don’t want to hear about your fucking
dreams!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh. But … Look, I’m sorry I shouted at you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Why are they all pigs at Information
Retrieval?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. Hey, that’s not a very nice thing
to say.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You know, smoking’s bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It’s my fucking life.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, of course. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I know you. I saw you through the floor,
didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I didn’t run away. I left the flat.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I didn’t like it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It had a hole in the floor. Where are we
going?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah … Er … It looks as if you’re taking me.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: It does doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t act guilty. Act like me. I’m just
getting on with my job. Or, are you just getting on with yours?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What does it look like … I’m collecting
empties.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: OK. What’s in the parcel?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What parcel?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It’s heavy.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: A heavy Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Open it if you don’t trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’d rather trust you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What are you doing in Information
Retrieval?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I mean, it doesn’t suit you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Suit me?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t you know the sort of thing that
Information Retrieval does?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What do you mean? Would you rather have
terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: We’ve got both.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Things would be worse without Information
Retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They couldn’t be worse for the Buttles.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Why don’t you say, no system is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, no system is.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Say, all wars have innocent victims.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, all wars do -</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who is this war against, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, terrorists of course.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: How many terrorists have you met? Actual
terrorists?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Actual. terrorists? Well … it’s only my first
day.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Look at that - right on time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What? I thought you were free to come and go as
you please.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Well, almost … unfortunately I do have to
punch in by 5.00 every day.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Every day?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They’ll be there waiting.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Who will?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Security.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’re joking.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. Please. They’re going to arrest you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I thought you arrested me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes … but, this is real. Now, stop!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Cut it out, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Will you please turn back.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Get away!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Turn!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Stop it … damn you!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’re mad! You’re out of your mind!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I was right! Step on it!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Let go! We’ve got to stop!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now you’re the one that’s out of your mind.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Sam … we can’t outrace them. You’ll kill
us!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t touch those!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Come on, let’s go! Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh God! What have we done?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: We? Don’t blame me!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It wasn’t supposed to happen like this.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Shit! The house is on fire!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “And your children all gone.”</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: “Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your
house is on fire and your children all gone” … Do you think anyone’s
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes. Come out, I know you’re in there</p>
<p><strong>officer in charge</strong>: Come out, we know you’re in
there! You cannot possibly escape. Throw your weapons from your vehicle
and come out slowly with your hands on your heads. Obey my instructions
and no harm will come to you. But if you force us to shoot we’ll shoot
to kill.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Are you still following me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please, Jill … I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There are plenty of other safe places. Why
don’t we go back to my flat?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’ve got to trust me. It sounds silly but I
know we were meant to meet.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You mean you were meant to hijack my truck,
make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for
me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust
you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your
friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What’s in it? It’s the
only thing you saved from the lorry …. It must he something very
special.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: I saved you from the lorry and you’re not very
special.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: ……….. It’s a bomb isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Oh … Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m going to open it!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No you’re not!</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: It’s me and Shirley!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ah … hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the
parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think that’ll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just
helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: My complication had a complication, but
Dr Chapman says I’ll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle.
Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill who is disappearing</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Shirley and I come here regularly. I
love romantic lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs terrain</strong>: Picture me in these.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t deserve to be! You should be dead, or
maimed like them …. How could you …? What a bloody stupid thing … I
should. have made you open it in the lorry</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: There’s your bomb! Our annual bribes for
official ass-holes like you!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Come on, make yourself useful, there are
people hurt!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Hey stop … she’s hurt!</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: SAM …. don’t!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where is she? Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: These helmets don’t half make your scalp
itch.</p>
<p><strong>guard b</strong>: Ooh, don’t mention it. And they make you
sweat. Half the time I can’t see where I’m going - there’s a great
Niagara of perspiration coming down.</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: I’m lucky, I’ve got thick eyebrows. That
keeps it up and channels it out to my ears.</p>
<p><strong>guard b</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: Someone from Information Retrieval they’re
always hanging about in lingerie.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill! Jill! Are you there?!</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: Excuse me, sir - that’s government
property.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is here a girl here? Tall, fair hair, blue
eyes?</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: Dunno sir. They check all that at the
depot.</p>
<p><strong>guard 3</strong>: We can’t allow you to do that sir, it’s
more than our job’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve got to find her! Jill! Jill!</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: You can always fill in an application form,
if you’re a relative, sir. Please stop, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill! Jill!</p>
<p><strong>guard a</strong>: Sorry about that sir. Regulations. We’ll
have you safely back in your office in no time.</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: This is a black eye for the department,
Lowry! … And I don’t care how you behaved when you were at Records!
Information Retrieval is an executive branch! We’re proud of our
reputation and we protect it!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Warren … I have to find out about …</p>
<p><strong>warren</strong>: Shut up! I don’t know what’s going on here,
Lowry, but don’t think you can intimidate us with your friends and
relatives in high places! Now shape up!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Lime, I need to use your computer</p>
<p><strong>lime</strong>: Sorry, a bit busy at the moment. You seem to
have quite a lot to do yourself.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to
see if she’s been arrested.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry, Sam, I’m afraid this whole case has
become much more complicated since last we talked.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s innocent, Jack — she’s done nothing
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tell that to the wives of the Security men she
blew up this afternoon. Listen, we’ve also had a report just in from
Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged
adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block.
I’d keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t really think Tuttle and the girl are
in league?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I do. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It could all be coincidental.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything’s
connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That’s the beauty of
it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them. This whole
Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye
bye.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack, she’s innocent!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sam - we’ve always been close, haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes we have, Jack!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, could you stay away from me until this
thing blows over.</p>
<p><strong>dream girl’s voice</strong>: I’m here Sam. Don’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill! What are you do … I mean … how did you …
Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What happened to you after …</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Your face … are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No. No. I’m fine. I was worried sick about you
… I thought …</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: C’mon, we’ve got to get you off the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For God’s sake, what’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Thermostat’s gone. And then some.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … And then some.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What have you done to my flat?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Sign here, please.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … ere please.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: It’s a 27B/6 of course.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: …B/6 of course.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Do you repeat everying?</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … Everything.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: This is what you get when you have cowboys
round yer ducts.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … yer ducts.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: I think you’ve got your T41 crystal inductor
wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It’s either
that or a new washer.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … new washer.</p>
<p><strong>spoor</strong>: Sign the form so we can get to it.</p>
<p><strong>dowser</strong>: … get to it.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t you like parties?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: C’mon. We’ve got to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: I’ll fix the damage when they’ve gone. I’ll
be ready for you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My mother said it would be all right.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: She didn’t say anything about it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, she’s my mother, not yours.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: I won’t be held responsible.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How long will she he away?</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe’s
clinic who never come back at all.</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: You’re not a professional, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: No, amateur.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you, Matthews.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Make yourself at home. Don’t answer the phone
or open he door to anyone. I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m going to pull some strings. It’s our only
hope.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Don’t do anything silly.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thanks for the vote of confidence.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Take care.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr
Helpmann’s office?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t, sir. You have to go
through the proper channels.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And you can’t tell me what the proper channels
are, because that’s classified information?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: I’m glad to see the Ministry’s continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thank you, Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>choir master</strong>: No, no, no, Arthur, you’re going flat
on that G. It’s your breathing. Take a breath on the end. of the
previous line, after Noel. Right, one, two, three.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me, but
we were close friends, and I keep his name alive at the office every
day. It’s as though he’s there speaking to me. “’ere I am, J.H.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?</p>

number. The teleprinter falls silent.</p>

for two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for a moment
and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches on the machine. He has

<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jill?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: What do you think? … is it me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You don’t exist any more. I’ve killed you. Jill
Layton is dead.</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Care for a bit of necrophilia?</p>
<p><strong>jill</strong>: Merry Xmas.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Everything is going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s dead. Check the list!</p>
<p><strong>guards</strong>: You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: a wonderful gift, I changed it at the
chemist for some antibiotics and bathroom scales and there’s enough left
on the voucher for a tonsilectomy if I want to treat myself …</p>
<p><strong>guard’s voice</strong>: Christmas Parcel for you, sir … sign
here please …</p>
<p><strong>official a</strong>: 93/HKS/608, you are charged with the
following: Passing confidential documents to unauthorized personnel -
viz IR dossier/Gillian Layton. Destroying Government property - viz an
indeterminate number of personnel carriers. Taking possession under
false pretences of said personnel carriers. Forging the signature of the
Head of Records, Third Department. Attempting to misdirect Ministry
funds, in the form of a cheque to A. Buttle, through unauthorized
channels. Tampering with Central Services supply ducts. Employing
unqualified suspected persons for this purpose. Attempting to conceal a
fugitive from justice. Obstructing the forces of law and order in the
exercise of their duty. Giving aid and comfort to the enemies of
society. Bringing into disrepute the good name of the Government, and
the standing within the community of the Department of Information
Retrieval. Attempting to disrupt the Ministry of Information Retrieval’s
internal communicating systems. Wasting Ministry time and paper.</p>
<p><strong>official b</strong>: We would advise you that a plea of
guilty will save you and the tax payer money, and will always be looked
upon more favourably than a plea of not guilty. All you are requested to
do at this stage is to sign this form.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where’s Jill?</p>
<p><strong>official a</strong>: Not interested?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What have you done with Jill?</p>
<p><strong>official a</strong>: Right. Next!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where’s Jill? What’s happened to Jill?</p>
<p><strong>official c</strong>: 93/HKS/608, you’ve got quite a list of
misdemeanours here, haven’t you? All this is going to take time and
money, and I’m afraid, according to your bank statement and credit
rating here, you’re likely to be in deep financial trouble by the end of
it. Now, either you plead guilty to say, seven or eight of these
charges, which’ll bring the costs down to within your reach, or you can
borrow a sum to be negotiated, from us, at very competitive rates. We
can offer you something at say, eleven and a half per cent, over thirty
years. But you will have to buy insurance to qualify for his scheme.</p>
<p><strong>official d</strong>: All you have to do is to agree to sign
the appropriate boxes on these forms. Yes or no?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not guilty! Not guilty you stupid
bastar…</p>
<p><strong>official e</strong>: Now, since you’ve elected to plead not
guilty on all these charges, you’d be well advised to take some sort of
insurance cover. Preferably comprehensive, or if you’d prefer, something
more specific - say, against electrical charges over f70.00. And for
food and accommodation costs of say, �800.00. Detention can be a very
expensive business.</p>
<p><strong>official f</strong>: Now, before we bore you with the small
print perhaps you’d like to tell us whether you’d like to sign this
insurance acceptance form or not. Think carefully before you decide.
Thinking ahead in financial matters is always the wise course.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: We’re here to save you and the tax payer
money.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Would you like to pay the premium for a
single room with a shower and a soft bed?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: For a small charge we can keep visits from
friends and relatives down to to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Plead guilty, it’s easier, quicker, and
cheaper for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: We’re doing a survey … Aimed at providing
a better service.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Do you think the present system is A.
efficient, B. inefficient?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: As a taxpayer are you A. impressed, B.
unimpressed</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Sam.</p>
<p><strong>gent</strong>: Sam, what are we going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ha ha ha ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can
you hear me, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where’s Jill? What have you done to her? Where
is she?!</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Gillian Layton?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes, you’ve got to get me out of here. I’ve got
to find her.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you
feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: I assure you, Sam, I’m doing everything
within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all
have to play by them - even me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is all a mistake! Don’t you
understand?!</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Yes, well, from the Department’s point of
view you’re certainly a bit of an own goal, but …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not a terrorist! You must know that! I’m
not guilty! Get me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Sam, if you’ve been going out there and
playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you’ve got absolutely
nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Please, I’ve got to find Jill.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Sam, I think I ought to tell you … I’m
afraid she’s upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: Yes, it’s all a bit confusing but, it
seems she was killed resisting arrest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, no … I did that…</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: The odd thing is it appears to have
happened twice … a bit of a disputed call, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>helpmann</strong>: So, there you are. All I can say is, don’t
fall at the last fence. The finishing post’s in sight. See you in the
paddock. Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball. Got to go …. Can’t keep
the orphans waiting.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Don’t fight it, son …. confess quickly …
Before they get into the expensive procedures. If you hold out too long
you could jeopardise your credit rating.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: 11/AFT/607, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack?… Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack, I’m innocent! Help me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bastard!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that
mask off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You stupid bastard!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How could you do this to me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Help me, Jack! I’m frightened!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How do you think I feel? You shit!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Jack …</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Shut up! This is a professional
relationship!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: JACK!! … You can’t … No, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Detonate!</p>
<p><strong>tuttle</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>matthews</strong>: A sad loss. Your mother was with her at
the end. The doctor said there was no pain.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It’s so good you could
make it. Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is …</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: what? … Oh …</p>
<p><strong>spiro</strong>: Madam …</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sam!!!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mother? … What … what’s … you’ve got to help me
…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Not now … please</p>
<p><strong>young gallant</strong>: Ida, is this fellow bothering you?
I’ll -</p>
<p><strong>sam’s pov</strong>: A rapidly receding street.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t dream anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mr helpmann</strong>: He’s got away from us, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m afraid you’re right, Mr. Helpmann. He’s
gone.</p>
