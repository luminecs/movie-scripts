<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The’s right… New York.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It’s 1958 – anyway, for a few mo’ minutes
it is. Come midnight it’s gonna be 1959. A whole ‘nother feelin’. The
New Year. The future…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin’ to start one
mo’ trip ‘round the sun, an’ evvybody hopin’ this ride ‘round be a
little mo’ giddy, a little mo’ gay…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Yep…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …All over town champagne corks is
a-poppin’.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Over in the Waldorf the big shots is
dancin’ to the strains of Guy Lombardo… Down in Times Square the little
folks is a-watchin’ and a- waitin’ fo’ that big ball to drop…</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: “Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!”</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …They all tryin’ to catch holt a one
moment of time…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …to be able to say – ‘Right now! This is
it! I got it!’ ‘Course by then it’ll be past. But they all happy,
evvybody havin’ a good time.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Well, almost evvybody. They’s a few lost
souls floatin’ ’round out there…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …This one’s Norville Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Let’s move in for a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …That office he jes stepped out of is the
office of the president of Hudsucker Industries. It’s his office…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …How’d he get so high? An’ why is he
feelin’ so low? Is he really gonna do it – is Norville really gonna
jelly up the sidewalk?</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …Well the future, that’s something you
can’t never tell about…</p>
<p><strong>up</strong>: “Nine! Eight! Seven!”</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …But the past… That’s another story…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: – So in the third quarter we saw no signs
of weakening. We’re up 18 percent over last year’s third quarter gross
and, needless to say, that’s a new record…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …The competition continues to flag and we
continue to take up the slack. Market share in most divisions is
increasing and we’ve opened seven new regional offices…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Our international division has also
shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and we’re looking
at some exciting things in</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Sub-franchising. Don’t talk to me about
sub-franchising; we’re making so much money in sub-franchising it isn’t
even funny.</p>
<p><strong>the future is now.</strong>: Start building yours at
Hudsucker Industries.</p>
<p><strong>no experience necessary.</strong>: Apply Personnel, 285
Madison Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Our owned-and-operateds are performing
far above expectations both here and abroad, and the Federal Tax Act of
1958 is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …The news in the money market isn’t good
– it’s excellent…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Our nominees and assigns continue to
multiply and expand extending our influence regionally, nationally and
globally. So, third quarter and year- to-date, we’ve set a new record
for sales…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …new record in gross…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …new record in pre-tax earnings…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …new record in after-tax profit…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …and our stock has split twice this
year…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …In short…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …we’re loaded.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Ahem…</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Mr. Hudsucker?</p>
<p><strong>the future is now.</strong>: Start building yours at
Hudsucker Industries.</p>
<p><strong>no experienced necessary.</strong>: Apply Personnel, 285
Madison Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh…</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.</p>
<p><strong>an executive</strong>: He could’ve opened the window.</p>
<p><strong>elderly executive</strong>: Waring Hudsucker never did
anything the easy way.</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things
were going so well!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man
was unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: He didn’t look unhappy!</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Yeah, well, he didn’t look rich.</p>
<p><strong>eldery executive</strong>: Waring Hudsucker was never an easy
man to figure out. He built this company with his bare hands. Every step
he took was a step up. Except of course this last one.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but when
the president, chairman of the board and holder of eighty-seven percent
of the company’s stock drops forty-four floors –</p>
<p><strong>precise executive</strong>: Forty-five –</p>
<p><strong>eldery executive</strong>: Counting the mezzanine –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: – Then the company has a problem.
Stillson, what exactly is the disposition of Waring’s stock?</p>
<p><strong>stillson</strong>: Well, as you know, Hud left no will and
had no family. The company bylaws are quite clear in that event. His
entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over
the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Meaning?</p>
<p><strong>stillson</strong>: Meaning simply that Waring’s stock, and
control of the company, will be available to the public on January
first.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: You mean to tell me that any slob in a
smelly T-shirt will be able to buy Hudsucker stock?</p>
<p><strong>stillson</strong>: The company bylaws are quite clear.</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: My God! You’re animals! How can you discuss
his stock when the man has just leapt forty-five floors –</p>
<p><strong>precise executive</strong>: Forty-four –</p>
<p><strong>elderly executive</strong>: – Not counting the mezzanine.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Quit showboating, Addison, the man is
gone. The question now is whether we’re going to let John Q. Public
waltz in and buy 87 percent of our company.</p>
<p><strong>pipe-smoking executive</strong>: What’re you suggesting,
Sidney? Certainly we can’t afford to buy a controlling interest.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Not while the stock is this strong. How
long before Hud’s paper hits the market?</p>
<p><strong>stillson</strong>: January first.</p>
<p><strong>an executive</strong>: Thirty days.</p>
<p><strong>another executive</strong>: Four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: A month at the most.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: One month to make the blue-chip
investment of the century look like a round-trip ticket on the
Titanic.</p>
<p><strong>an executive</strong>: We play up the fact that Hud is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Long live the Hud!!</p>
<p><strong>another executive</strong>: We depress the stock –</p>
<p><strong>yet another executive</strong>: – to the point where we can
buy fifty-percent.</p>
<p><strong>precise executive</strong>: Fifty-one.</p>
<p><strong>elderly executive</strong>: Not counting the mezzanine.</p>
<p><strong>cautious executive</strong>: It could work.</p>
<p><strong>optimistic executive</strong>: It should work.</p>
<p><strong>practical executive</strong>: It would work.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: It’s working already. Waring Hudsucker
is abstract art on Madison Avenue. All we need now is a new president
who will inspire real panic in our stockholders.</p>
<p><strong>enthusiastic executive</strong>: Yeah, a puppet!</p>
<p><strong>another executive</strong>: A proxy!</p>
<p><strong>yet another executive</strong>: A pawn!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really push
around.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: You punch in at 8:30 every morning except you
punch in at 7:30 following a business holiday unless it’s a Monday and
then you punch in at eight o’clock! You punch in at 7:45 whenever we
work extended day and you punch out at the regular time unless you’ve
worked through lunch!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: What’s exte –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Punch in late and they dock ya!</p>
<p><strong>first screamer</strong>: This goes to seven! Mr. Mutuszak!
Urgent!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Incoming articles, get a voucher! Outgoing
articles, provide a voucher! Move any article without a voucher and they
dock ya!</p>
<p><strong>second screamer</strong>: Take this up to the secretarial
pool on three! Right away! Don’t break it!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Letter size a green voucher! Folder size a
yellow voucher! Parcel size a maroon voucher!</p>
<p><strong>third screamer</strong>: This one’s for Morgatross! Chop
chop!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Wrong color voucher and they dock ya!
Six-seven-eight-seven-zero-four- niner-alpha-slash-six! That is your
employee number! It will not be repeated! Without your employee number
you cannot cash your paycheck!</p>
<p><strong>fourth screamer</strong>: This goes up to twenty-seven! If
there’s no one there bring it down to eighteen! Have ’em sign the
waiver!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Inter-office mail is code 37! INTRA- office
mail is 37-dash-3! Outside mail is 3-dash 37! Code it wrong and they
dock ya!</p>
<p><strong>fifth screamer</strong>: I was supposed to have this on
twenty- eight ten minutes ago! Cover for me!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: This has been your orientation! Is there
anything you do not understand? Is there anything you understand only
partially? If you have not been fully oriented – if there is something
you do not understand in all of its particulars you must file a
complaint with personnel! File a faulty complaint… and they dock ya!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Bring it down to fif… fifteen… sign the
voucher, uh, waiver… cover for Mr. Anatole… he’s a swell guy…
Morgatross… He was on, uh…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Say, what do you do when the envelope is
too big for the slot?</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Well… if ya fold ’em, they fire
ya…</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: …I usually throw ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Just got hired today!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Ya know, entry level!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I got big ideas, though!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: I’m sure you do.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: For instance, take a look at this sweet
baby…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …you look like you can keep a secret…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Something I developed myself. Yessir,
this is my ticket upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …You know, for kids!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: So ya see, I won’t be in the mailroom
long.</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Nooo, I don’t guess you will be.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: How long’ve you been down here?</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Forty-eight years…</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: …Next year they move me up to
parcels…</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: …If I’m lucky.</p>
<p><strong>public address system</strong>: Attention Hudsucker
employees. We regretfully announce that at 12:01 this afternoon,
Hudsucker time, Waring Hudsucker, Founder, President, and Chairman of
the Board of Hudsucker Industries, merged with the infinite. To mark
this occasion of corporate loss, we ask that all employees observe a
moment of silent contemplation.</p>
<p><strong>public address system</strong>: …Thank you for your kind
attention. This moment has been duly-noted on your time cards and will
be deducted from your pay. That is all.</p>
<p><strong>public address system</strong>: ‘Blue letter! Blue
letter!’</p>
<p><strong>various voices</strong>: Blue letter…! It’s a blue letter…!
They’re bringing down a blue letter!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Blue letter!!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: Jumpin’ Jehosephat, a blue
letter!</p>
<p><strong>ancient sorter</strong>: It’s a blue letter… top, top level…
confidential communication between the brass… usually bad news… they
hate blue letters upstairs… Hate ’em!</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: You!</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: …Yeah, you! Barnes!</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: …You don’t look busy! Think you can
handle a blue letter? …This letter was sent down this morning by the big
guy himself! ’At’s right, Waring Hudsucker! It’s addressed to Sid
Mussburger! Hudsucker’s right-hand man! It’s a blue letter! That means
you put it right in Mussburger’s hand. No secretaries! No receptionists!
No colleagues! No excuses!</p>
<p><strong>hutchinson</strong>: Mussburger!!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got the
fuzz…</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …I make the elevator do what she duzz!</p>

<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …What’s your pleasure, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Forty-fourth floor, and it’s very –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy!
What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to
get down?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say,
buddy!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell, personnel.
Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>mr. levin</strong>: Thirty-six.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen, step to the
rear; here comes gargantuan Mr. Grier.</p>
<p><strong>fat man</strong>: Buzz.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Say, buddy! Who’s the most liquid businessman
on the street?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it’s ‘wearing’ Hudsucker!
Na-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …Ya get it, buddy, it’s a pun, it’s a
knee-slapper, it’s a play on Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a blue
letter?!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …Cripes a’mighty, whyn’t ya tell a guy?! Hold

<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Good luck, buddy!</p>

<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Uhh, no, I –</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Shall we look in the book,

<p><strong>norville</strong>: No, ma’am, ya see, I wouldn’t be in the

<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: We don’t seem to be in the
boooook.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: No, ma’am, ya see I don’t have an –</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: If we had an appointment we’d be in
the booook.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I know but ya see I have this – here it
is, this letter –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: – Sure sure, Parkinson’s stupid but he’s
ambitious, too hard to control…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled the
Teleyard merger, but that means he’s got something to prove…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Who let you in?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired him
last week –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Tell him I’ll be right there… Well, what
is it?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: You, maybe you’re the company’s biggest
moron. We can’t use Morris, he’s been with us too long, he’s a nice guy,
too many friends. Matter of fact, why don’t you fire him. No – scratch
that; I’ll fire him. …Make it fast, make it fast.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mr. Bumstead is getting very –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: I’ll be right there. Give him a
magazine. …What’re you, a mute?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Yeah, how’s the stock doing? …Bad, huh?
Well it’s not bad enough. …Look, chump, either you find me a grade A
ding-dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom. And that
goes double for you. Ear-clay? Ood-gay! This better be good. I’m in a
bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, sir. I’ve got something for you from
the mailroom, but first if I could just take a minute or so from your
very busy time…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …to show you a, uh…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …a little something I’ve been working on
for the last two or three years…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …You know, for kids! Which is perfect for
Hudsucker – not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say,
inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I’d say it’s at
least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet
baby –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Umm-hmm…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Siddown.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Go ahead. Try it on.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Put your feet up.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Hmmmm… Let’s get to know one another,
shall we?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Let’s chat! …Man to man!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …You weren’t blessed with much…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …education, were you?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, I’m a college graduate –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: All right, but you didn’t excel in your
studies…?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, I made the dean’s list.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: At the Muncie College of Business
Administration.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure. And did your classmates
there call you ‘jerk’ or… …‘schmoe’?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …‘Shnook’? ‘Dope’? ‘Dipstick’?
‘Lamebrain’?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Not even behind your back?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Sir! They voted me most likely to
succeed!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But, sir! –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Get your feet off that desk.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Get out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: My God! The Bumstead contracts!!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: You nitwit! I worked for three years on
this deal!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: I’ll take care of it. Just get out!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the
most sensitive deal of my career!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Now out of here! Out!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Not that way! Through the door!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Right away, buster! Out of my
office!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Up on your feet! We don’t crawl at
Hudsucker Industries!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Sir, my leg is on fire!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Get out of this office, you dithering
nincompoop!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: My God! The Bumstead contracts!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!</p>
<p><strong>bumstead</strong>: No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger! I
wanna see Mussburger! Or did he jump out a window too?!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Don’t worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha. I
gotcha by your pants!</p>
<p><strong>luigi</strong>: Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you pants a
nice-a dooble stitch. Make ’em strong, and they look-a real sharp.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: No! Single stitch is fine.</p>
<p><strong>luigi</strong>: But please-a, Meester Moosaburger, the dooble
stitch she last-a forever –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Why on earth would I need a double
stitch? To pad your bill? Single stitch is fine!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>luigi</strong>: What the heck. Meester Moosaburger such a
nice-a guy, I give him dooble steech-a anyway. Assa some-a strong- a
steech-a, you bet!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: ‘The Einstein of Enterprise.’ ‘The Edison of
Industry.’ ‘The Billion- Dollar Cranium’… ‘Idea Man’! And not one of you
mugs has given me a story on him!!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Facts, figures, charts! They never sold a
newspaper! I read this morning’s edition of the Argus and let me tell
you something: I’d wrap a fish in it! I’d use it as kindling! Hell, I’d
even train my poodle with it if he wasn’t a French poodle and more
partial to the pages of Paree Soir! But I sure wouldn’t shell out a
hard-earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Come on, chief, give us a break.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Suuuure, Tibbs, take a break! Go to Florida!
Lie in the sun! Wait for a coconut to drop, file a story on it – it’ll
be more of a grabber than your piece on the commie grain surplus! The
human angle! That’s what sells papers! We need a front page with heart
and the whole idea of the ‘Idea Man’ idea can put it there!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Chief, if we had more access –</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Yeah, and if a frog had wings he wouldn’t
bump his ass a-hoppin’! I don’t want excuses, I want results!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: I wanna know what makes the Idea Man tick!
Where is he from? Where is he going? I wanna know everything about this
guy! Has he got a girl? Has he got parents?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Everybody has parents.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: All right, how many? How ’bout it,
Parkinson, you’ve been awful quiet over there.</p>
<p><strong>parkinson</strong>: Uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>reporter next to him</strong>: Still waters run deep,
chief.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: The only thing that runs deep with Parkinson
is the holes in his ears. Yes, the Idea Man! What’re his hopes and
dreams, his desires and aspirations? Does he think all the time or does
he set aside a certain portion of the day? How tall is he and what’s his
shoe size? Where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast? Does
he put jam on his toast or doesn’t he put jam on his toast, and if not
why not and since when?</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: …Well?!!</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: …Ahh, you’re useless. Yes, Idea Man!
Creator! Innovator! Cerebrator! Tycoon!–</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Fake.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Huhh!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I tell ya the guy’s a phony.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Phony, huh?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: As a three-dollar bill.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Sez who?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man –
because Hudsucker says he is? What’re his ideas? Why won’t they let
anyone interview him?…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Five bucks says she mentions her
Pulitzer.</p>
<p><strong>other reporter</strong>: Again? You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …And just take a look at the mug on this guy –
the jutting eyebrows, the simian forehead, the idiotic grin. Why he has
a face only a mother could love –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …On payday! The only story here is how this guy
made a monkey out of you, Al.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Yeah, well, monkey or not I’m still editor
of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. – J.
Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I filed it yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>editor</strong>: Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama’s
Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea
Man story!</p>
<p><strong>reporters</strong>: All right, chief… We’ll do our best,
chief… I’ll give it a shot, chief…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Al, he’s the bunk.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ll stake my Pulitzer on it!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Say, buddy! Where’d ya get the new duds?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …and say, buddy! How’d old bucketbutt like his
blue letter? Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut? Did he die? Did he –
Well, hello, Mr. Mussburger, sir…</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …How’re you this fine morning, sir?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: That reminds me, Mr. Mu… uh, Sid. I never
did give you that–</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Lobby. We haven’t got all day.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Well I’m starved. I understand it’ll be
quite an affair this afternoon, and the executive roast tom turkey at
the Bohemian Grove redefines the word superb.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: My pleasure, sir.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Roast tom turkey. Gee, I’m hungry too
–</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure…</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: It’s been a pleasure serving you,
Mr. Mussburger.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …and it’s been a pleasure serving you too, uh…
buddy.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Say, Mr. Muss – uh, Sid! Shouldn’t we be a
little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last
few days? I mean, you’re the expert, but at the Muncie College of
Business Administration they told us –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Relax, Norville. It’s only natural in a
period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Okay, Sid. Like I said, you’re the expert,
but –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …You don’t happen to remember the plan I
outlined to you the day I set fire to your off – uh, the day I was
promoted?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: I do remember and I was impressed.
Anyway, that’s all forgotten now. Driver!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention
it is, it would require such a small capital investment – again, you’re
the expert here –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Damnit, where’s my car!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – But there’s such an enormous potential
profit-wise given the demographics – baby boom – discretionary income in
the burgeoning middle class –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Finally.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – So if you think it’s appropriate, I’d
like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure, tell whoever you want…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …And I’d like to hear more about it at
some point, too.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But, Sid, I thought you and I were…</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk clear
here?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But I’m the president of this – aww,
forget it.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: I got gas, Bennie.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Yeah, tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: No kiddin’, Bennie. I got gas.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Ya get the special?</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Fah from it…</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: …Enter the dame.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: There’s one in every story.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Ten bucks says she’s looking for a
handout.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Twenty bucks says not here she don’t
find one.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She’s looking for her mark.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: She finds him.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She sits down.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: …and awduhs a light lunch.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She looks in her purse…</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: …No money.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: The mark notices.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: …He’s not noticing, Benny.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Maybe he’s wise.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: He don’t look wise.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Plan two: Here come the waterworks.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Yellowstone.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Old Faithful.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Hello, Niagara.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: He notices.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: He’s concerned.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She explains her perdicament, and…</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1 &amp; #2</strong>: …entuh the light lunch.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: She’s got other problems, of course…</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: …Her mother needs an operation…</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: …adenoids.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: No, Bennie: Lumbago.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She’s losing him, Bennie.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: Maybe he’s wise.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: He don’t look wise.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: How does she pull this out?</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She isn’t!</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: She is!</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: She’s good, Bennie.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: She’s damn good, Lou.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Can I get you boys anything else?</p>
<p><strong>veteran #1</strong>: Bromo.</p>
<p><strong>veteran #2</strong>: …Bromo.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sorry we had to take the stairs. It was
just that horrible little elevator boy…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Not at all. You’re light as a feather.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: The couch, please.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t know what came over me. I suppose it
was the shock of eating after so long without; the enzymes kicking in
after so long, or whatever. But then you couldn’t possibly know what it
is to be tired and hungry…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Hungry, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t want to bore you with all the sordid
details of my life; it’s not a happy story…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Suffice it to say that I’m jobless – though
not for want of trying, that I’m friendless, with no one to – thank you
– take care of me; and that had you not come along at just exactly the
moment that you did –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville, I didn’t know you were president
here!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing really. Just
determination and hard work…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Of course, when I started in the mailroom
last Tuesday I thought it might take more time –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Say, buddy, here’s the whiskey you asked f
–</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on the
desk.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Happy days, buddy…</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …and I’ll tell your secretary you’re not to be
disturbed. Yowzuh!!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What a horrible little person.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago,
full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world
–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: A little naive perhaps but – thank you – armed
with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the
future –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I myself –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Only to have that belief, that unsullied
optimism, dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place
–</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and
ye shall prosper – these were the watch words of my education, the
ethics of my tender years –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – these were the values that were instilled in
me while I was growing up in a little town you’ve probably never heard
of –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Mind if I join you?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Be my guest. A little town you’ve probably
–</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: He waves his arms and talks with a thick
rasp as he staggers to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Excuse me – I – executive washroom…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Are you all right?…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Is it your lunch? The chicken a la king?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: No, I –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is the a la king repeating on you?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …I’m fine, I… You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Values… watchwords… uh, tender years… – A
little town you’ve probably never heard of…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Muncie, Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>turned off</strong>: she re-strikes her languid pose on the
couch just as the washroom door opens.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You’re from Muncie?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why yes, do you know it?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘Fight on fight on dear old Muncie Fight
on – Hoist the gold and blue You’ll be tattered, torn and hurtin’ Once
‘The Munce’ is done with you!’</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Goooooooo Eagles!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat’s
pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I’m gonna cancel the rest of my
appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, no, really, I –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Don’t bother to thank me, it’s the easiest
thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came
up.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Mail room.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …This’ll only take a moment.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville
Barnes –</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And
where’s my voucher?!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Well, I’m not sure where I –</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: I need that voucher! I told you a week ago
it was important!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: But look, I’m president of the company now
and I –</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: I don’t care if you’re president of the
company! I need that voucher! Now!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, of all the foolish… Listen, do you
take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Of course – I went to the Muncie, uh,
Secretarial Polytechnic!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, I just don’t know how to thank you,
Mr. Barnes –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Please! Norville!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …It’s my pleasure!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Gooooooo Eagles!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Gooooooooo Eagles!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: …Once ‘The Munce’… Holy…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the
old mother routine –</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Adenoids?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Lumbago.</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: That gag’s got whiskers on it!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker
is up to something –</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ancient puzzler</strong>: Say, Amy, what’s a six-letter word
for an affliction of the hypothalmus?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – And it’s a cinch – Goiter – it’s a cinch this
guy isn’t in on it. How much time to make the Late Final?</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Chief.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted to
apologize to…</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: About seven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man… Well,
thanks for being so generous… It is human, and you are divine… No, he’s
no faker. He’s the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine
article: the guy is a real moron –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – as in a five-letter word for imbecile –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – as pure a specimen as I’ve ever run across…
Am I sure he’s a nitwit? Heck, if working at the Argus doesn’t make me
an expert then my name isn’t Amy Archer and I’ve never won the Pulitzer
Prize…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …In 1957… My series on the reunited triplets –
come on down here, hammerhead, and I’ll show it to ya…</p>
<p><strong>ancient puzzler</strong>: Amy, what’s a three-letter word for
a flightless bird?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Not now, Morris, I’m busy – That’s right, I
said hammerhead, as in a ten-letter word for a smug bullying
self-important newspaperman –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – Gnu –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – who couldn’t find –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – That’s G-N-U –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – couldn’t find the Empire State Building with
a compass, a road map and a native guide.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – or emu.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …And that’s just the potatoes, Smitty, here
comes the gravy: The chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Better off falling for a rattlesnake.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m tellin’ ya, this guy’s just the patsy and
I’m gonna find out what for. There’s a real story, Smitty, some kind of
plot, a setup, a cabal, a – oh, and say, did I tell ya?!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: He didn’t offer you money.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: A sawbuck!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Ten dollars? Let’s grab a highball!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: On Norville Barnes!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Copy!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Miss Smith, can you come in please to take
a letter…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …of all the cockamamie…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Did you happen to see the front page of
today’s Manhattan Argus?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, I… didn’t bother to read the article. I
didn’t think the picture did you justice.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: The picture was fine! It’s what that
knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible… Amy,
take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you ‘Miss’ because you seem to
have ‘missed’ the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you
know whether I’m an imbecile when you don’t even have the guts to come
in here and interview me man to man! No, change ‘guts’ to ‘courage.’ No,
make it ‘common decency.’ These wild speculations about my intelligence
–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – or lack thereof?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – these preposterous inventions, would be
better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of
the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered
mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it.
I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at
Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours
sincerely, et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Is that all, Mr. Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Well, you know me, Amy, at least better
than that that dame does. Do you think I’m an imbecile?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m sure I –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I
put a lot of stock in your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, I –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh sure, you’re biased – you’re a fellow
Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …I designed it myself and this is just the
sweet baby that can put Hudsucker right back on top.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …You know! For kids!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Why don’t I just type this up…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Aww, naw, Amy, that won’t be necessary. I
shouldn’t send it; she’s just doing her job, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, I don’t know; maybe she does deserve it.
Maybe she should’ve come in to face you man to man.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, she probably had a deadline…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sure, but – she could still have gotten your
side for the record!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, it’s done now – what’s the use of
grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some
steam…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …She’s probably just a little
confused.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Confused?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yeah, you know, probably one of these
fast-talking career gals, thinks she’s one of the boys. Probably is one
of the boys, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m quite sure I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these
complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn’t it? She’s
probably very unattractive and bitter about it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, is that it!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men’s
clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and
hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or
Smoocher or…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Smitty.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Exactly. And I bet she’s ugly. Real ugly.
Otherwise, why wouldn’t they print her picture next to her byline?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal
appearance.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I bet that’s exactly what she tells
herself! But you and I both know she’s just a dried-up bitter old maid.
Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I
was thinking maybe The King and I –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …How about Oklahoma?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville Barnes, you don’t know a thing about
that woman! You don’t know who she really is! And only a numbskull
thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Say, what gives?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Memo. From the desk of Sidney J.
Mussburger. Executive order number 530 slash A49. To: Director of the
Jacksonville Facility. Copies to: Legal Affairs, Business Affairs,
Central Files. Re: Movement of Raw Materials from the Huron Facility.

<p><strong>voice</strong>: Watchoo doin’ down they, Miss Archuh?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Huh?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Who are you? How did you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about
ever’thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But – who are you – what d’you do here?</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Ah keeps the ol’ circle turning – this ol’
clock needs plenty o’ care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money – it
drives that ol’ global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin’ on
‘roun’. Ya see, without that capital fo’mation –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Say, you won’t tell anyone about
me, will you?</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: I don’t tell no one nothin’ lessen they ask.
Thatches ain’t ole Moses’ way.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell
me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust.
I didn’t think the Board was that smart.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: That smart?!</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: But then I figured it out: they did it ’cause
they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah
know.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be
president?</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: ‘Cause they’s little pigglies! They’s tryin’
to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so’s they can snitch it all
up fo’ themselves! But Norville, he’s got some tricks up his sleeve, he
does…</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …you know, fo’ kids? Yeah, he’s a smart one,
that Norville, heh-heh, he’s a caution. Wal, some folks is square, an’
some is hip –</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …But I guess you don’t really know him any
better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, maybe I –</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: An’ only some kind a knucklehead thinks she
knows things ’bout things she, uh – when she don’t, uh – How’d that
go?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s hardly the same –</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Why you don’t even know y’own self – you
ain’t exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I
have to go undercover as it were –</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: I don’t mean that! Why you pretendin’ to be
such a hard ol’ sourpuss! Ain’t never gonna make you happy! Never made
Warin’ happy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m happy enough.</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Okay, Miss Archuh. …I got gears to see
to.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’m plenty happy!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: Them po’ young folks. Looks like Norville’s
in fo’ the same kind o’ heartache ol’ Warin’ had. But then, she never
axed me ’bout dat…</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: I can’t print this!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Why not, it’s all true! The board is using this
poor guy! They’re depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: It’s pure speculation! Why, they’d have my
butt in a satchel!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Ol’ satchel-butt…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I know they’re gonna buy that stock –</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You don’t know anything! Fact is they haven’t
bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What’re they waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Amy’s hunches are usually pretty good,
Chief.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: You don’t accuse someone of stock
manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz! The readers of the Manhattan Argus
aren’t interested in sensationalism, gossip and unsupported speculation.
Facts, figures – those are the tools of the newspaper trade! Why it’s
almost as if you’re trying to take the heat off this Barnes numbskull –
like you’ve gone all soft on him!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Come on, Chief, that’s a low blow. Archer’s
not gonna go goey for a corn-fed idiot.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: All right, I was out of line. But you’re out
of line with this stock swindle story. Gimme some more of that
Moron-from-Sheboygan stuff –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Muncie.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Whatever. That’s what sells newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I’ve got an even hotter story – The Sap from
the City Desk.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Watch it, Archer –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: It’s about a dimwitted editor who –</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Easy, Amy…</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: …Let’s grab a highball and calm down.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Back off – smoocher!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: Say, what gives?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mussburger</strong>: – So we’d gone out to the Hamptons
and the garden was in positive ruins!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: That must have been quite a
disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mussburger</strong>: Disappointment? J’etais destroyee!
I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the
gardener and said, ’Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next
spring or you are terminee!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mussburger</strong>: I’m brushing up on my French with
the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I haven’t had –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mussburger</strong>: Sidney and I are planning a trip to
Paris and points continental – Aren’t we, dear?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure. I’m going to borrow Norville
for a while, if you don’t mind, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. mussburger</strong>: Well, frankly, I…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss – uh,
Sid.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: So they tell me. Norville, let me
shepherd you through some of the introductions here. Try not to talk too
much; some of our biggest stockholders are, uh – scratch that: Say
whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce
Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker Industries largest and most loyal
stockholders.</p>
<p><strong>cardozo</strong>: Dammit boy, what’s this I hear about you
bein’ an embecile? What the hell is ailin’ ya?! A week ago my stock was
worth twice what it is now! I’m considering dumping the whole shootin’
match, unless I see some vast improvement! Dammit, boy, It’s a range
war! Either you pull our wagons into a circle or I’m pullin’ out of the
wagon train!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: No need for concern, sir; it’s only
natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for
cover –</p>
<p><strong>cardozo</strong>: So I’m yella, am I?!!</p>
<p><strong>cardozo</strong>: …We’ll see who’s yella!!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cardozo</strong>: Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein’
sech an ole grizzly.</p>
<p><strong>cardozo</strong>: Aww, I wasn’t gonna hurt the boy,
Lorelei…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I’m sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I
showed him the long view we might –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Norville, this is Thorstensen
Finlandsen, who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled
investors.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to meet
you – uh, happy to walk into y – uh, pleased to make your –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Thank you, sir…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …I understand your concern about the
down-ward, you know, but I think you’ll find under our strong new
leadership…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: We anticipate, in short order, an
upward…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. findlandsen</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished members
of the Hudsucker board. I give you the king of swing, the rajah of
romance, the incredible, the unforgettable Mister Vic… Tenetta!</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: How’s it going, Mr. Mussburger?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Bad.</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: But not bad enough.</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: It could be better, it could be
worse.</p>
<p><strong>all three executives</strong>: Hmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: The stock’s got to drop another five
points if we expect to get controlling interest. Norville tells me he’s
got some hot idea. Can’t be good.</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: Then it can’t be bad!</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Couldn’t be better if it couldn’t be
worse.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Hmmmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Norville?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …What happened?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh. Nothing, really, just… the more timid
investors are no longer running for cover.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Let me look.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Sid found me the icepack.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Let me hold it, or you’ll have a real
shiner.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over
this imbecile story.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, it isn’t your fault, Amy. You’re the
one person who’s been standing by me through all this.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville… there’s something I have to tell you.
You see, I’m not really a secretary.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I know that, Amy.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …You do?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: I understand that you’re not very skilled
yet in the secretarial arts. I’m not that skilled as president. Oh sure,
I put up a big front – – not that everyone’s buying it.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I believe in you, Norville – At least I believe
in your… intentions –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, I don’t blame them, really. I guess I
have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their
investment. Most of them are very nice people –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville, you can’t trust people here like you
did in Muncie…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Certain people are –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Didja ever go to the top of old man
Larson’s feed tower and look out over the town?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Huh?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You know, on farm route 17.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh yes! In Muncie!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Uh – Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I – well no, I – I
never really… There’s a place I go now, the cutest little place near my
apartment in Greenwich Village. It’s called Ann’s 440. It’s a beatnik
bar.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian
coffee, and the people there – well, none of them quite fit in. You’d
love it – why don’t you come there with me – they’re having a marathon
poetry reading on New Year’s Eve. I go every year.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Every year?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Well – this year – if it’s good I plan to make
it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …The people look like ants.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, the Hindus say – and the beatniks
also – that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some
will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the
sea.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: What a beautiful thought.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: What do you think you were in your
previous life, Amy?</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe I was just a
fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I
find that very farfetched.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville, there really is something I have to
tell you –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: That kind of person would come back as a
wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a
gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush.
Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have
been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had – foraging
together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another’s
coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our
separate ways…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I
was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, can I at least call you deer?
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik
friends call ‘karma’ – the great circle of life, death and rebirth.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, I think I’ve heard of that. What goes
around comes around.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: That’s it. A great wheel that gives us
each what we deserve…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Tomorrow’s my big presentation to the
board. I’ve gotta show Sidney and the guys that I deserve all their
confidence!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Oh, Norville –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for
luck!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Sure, Norville, sure…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Oh, Norville!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – So we have economy, simplicity, low
production cost and the potential for mass appeal, and all that spells
out great profitability…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …I had the boys down at R &amp; D throw
together this prototype so that our discussion here could have some
focus…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …and to give you gentlemen of the Board a
first-hand look at just how exciting this gizmo is…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …It’s fun, it’s healthy, it’s good
exercise; kids’ll just love it, and we put a little sand inside to make
the whole experience more pleasant. And the great part is we won’t have
to charge an arm and a leg!</p>
<p><strong>elderly executive</strong>: Yeah but… What is it?</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Does it have rules?</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Can more than one play?</p>
<p><strong>executive #4</strong>: What makes you think it’s a game?</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Is it a game?</p>
<p><strong>executive #5</strong>: Will it break?</p>
<p><strong>executive #6</strong>: It better break eventually!</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: Is there an object?</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Are you supposed to make it fly
off?</p>
<p><strong>executive #5</strong>: Does it come with batteries?</p>
<p><strong>executive #4</strong>: Could we charge extra for them?</p>
<p><strong>executive #7</strong>: Is it safe for toddlers?</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: How can you tell when you’re done?</p>
<p><strong>executive #2</strong>: How do you make it stop?</p>
<p><strong>executive #1</strong>: Is that a girl’s model or a boy’s?</p>
<p><strong>executive #3</strong>: Can a parent assemble it??</p>
<p><strong>executive #7</strong>: What if you get tired before it’s
done?</p>
<p><strong>executive #6</strong>: Is there a larger model for the
obese?</p>
<p><strong>executive #4</strong>: Can you do it around your neck?</p>
<p><strong>elderly executive</strong>: And finally… what is it?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: You know, for kids! It’s… it’s … well,
it’s…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: It’s brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …It’s genius. It’s just exactly what
Hudsucker needs at this juncture. Sure, sure, a blind man could tell you
that there’s an enormous demand for this, uh…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Congratulations, kid, you’ve really
outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I’m going to recommend to the
Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh… with the, uh… that the
dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as
president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well… I’m for it…</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: We’ll call it the Flying Donut!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: The Dancing Dingus!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: The Jerky Circle!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: Something short.</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: Sharp.</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: Snappy.</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: With a little jazz.</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: The Shazzammeter!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: The Hipster!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: The Daddy-Oh!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: The Circle-o’-Gaiety!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: The Hoopsucker!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: The Hudswinger!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: The Hoop-dee-doo!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: The Hudsucker Hoop!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #3</strong>: Fellas. Fellas!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #1</strong>: Ya got somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>ad man #2</strong>: Ya got somethin’?!</p>
<p><strong>ad man #3</strong>: Fellas! I got somethin’!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …Norville!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Rockwell News presents… ‘Tidbits of
Time!’ World news in pictures, we kid you not.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …What began as the brainchild of this
Madison Avenue whiz kid is now a craze sweeping the nation. The ‘hula
hoop,’ product of Hudsucker Industries, is a recreational device that
some experts predict may eclipse the television as a means of
entertainment…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …This dancing dingus of delight, this
jerky circle of gaiety, is proving to be the toy of choice of most
American youngsters. – Whoa- ho! Did I say youngsters?! Here’s mom,
taking a break from her household chores…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …and even dad is ‘swinging’ into the
act!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …and so the congratulations pour in for
up-and-comer Norville Barnes, inventor of the hoop – including one very
special call!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He’s on! He’s on the line!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>crackling voice</strong>: Hello, Norville. This is the
President…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: …I just wanted to congratulate you. I’m very
proud of you, Norville…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh my God, sir!</p>
<p><strong>ike</strong>: …Mrs. Eisenhower is very proud of you. The
American people are very proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Barnes, how’d ya come up with the
idea for the hula hoop?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, it was no great idea, really. A
thing like this, it takes a whole company to put it together, and I’m
just grateful for the opportunity –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Mr. Barnes, did you have any idea
there’d be such a huge response?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, frankly, I don’t think anybody
expected this much hoopla –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: ‘Hoopla on the hula hoop’ – can we
quote you on that, Mr. Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well sure, I guess –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: Mr. Barnes, are you thinking of giving
yourself a nice fat raise?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Ha-ha-ha-ha. Come on, guys…</p>
<p><strong>newsreel announcer</strong>: What scientific principle
explains the mind-bending motion of this whipping wheel of wonder?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Ze dinkus is kvite zimple, really. It
operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze earth spinning ’round ze sun,
and zat keeps you from flying off ze earth into ze coldest reaches of
outer space vere you vood die like a miserable shvine! Yes, ze principle
is ze same, except for ze piece of grrrit zey put in to make ze whole
experience more pleasant –</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Barnes, did the board consider you
an ‘idea man’ when they promoted you from the mail room?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, I guess so – I don’t think they
promoted me because they thought I was a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Mr. Barnes, what’s the next big idea
for you and Hudsucker Industries?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Jeez, I don’t know. An idea like this
sweet baby doesn’t just come overnight…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Barnes, are you –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – Although I’ll tell you one thing: I
certainly didn’t expect all this ‘hoopla’!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …And you can quote me on that!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Yes, it’s hula hula everywhere! From the
cocktail parties of the Park Avenue smart set…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …to sweethearts who want to be married in
the ‘swing’ of things…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: …To our friend the Negro, in the heart of
the dark continent.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Barnes, Mr. Barnes, Rumpus magazine
has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year, and the society
pages have been linking you with high-fashion model Za-Za. Would you
care to comment?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: There’s no truth to the rumors; we’re just
dear friends…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Isn’t that right, Za-Za?</p>
<p><strong>za-za</strong>: Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-oww!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Ho-leeee!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #3</strong>: Mr. Barnes, whither Hudsucker? Whither
Norville Barnes?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #4</strong>: How do you respond to the charges that
you’re out of ideas? Has Norville Barnes run dry?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Not at all. Why, just this week I came up
with several new sweet ideas. A larger model hula hoop for the portly. A
battery option for the lazy and handicapped. A model with more sand for
hard-of-hearing. I’m earning my keep.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #5</strong>: Speaking of that, Mr. Barnes, do you
expect to get a raise?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, by anyone’s account I’ve saved
Hudsucker Industries; our stock is worth more than it’s ever been. So,
yes, I expect to be compensated for that.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Pull yourself together, Addison.</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold
all of our stock?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: We dumped the whole load. Now quit
showboating, Addison –</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: I had twenty thousand shares! I’d be a
millionaire now!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure, we’d all be millionaires.
There’s no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping
our position would panic the market, further depress the stock – then
we’d buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap –</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: Cheap! Cheap! It’s never been more
valuable! And I’m ruined! Ruined!</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: I’m getting off this merry-go-round!</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: Addison!</p>
<p><strong>another executive</strong>: Myron!</p>
<p><strong>addison</strong>: Aaaaahhh!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Plexiglas. Had it installed last
week.</p>
<p><strong>executive</strong>: …Myron?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: All right, so the kid caught a wave. So
right now he and his dingus are on top. Well, this too shall pass.
Myrtle J. Mussburger didn’t raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first
sign of adversity. I say, we made this kid and we can break him. I say,
the higher he climbs, the harder he drops. I say, yes, the kid has a
future, and in it I see shame, dishonor, ignominy and disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Hold it!…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Nobody move, nobody breathe…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …An idea… is coming…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Deflates. He glares at the tailor.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: It’s gone now.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Miss Amy here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Is she in the book? –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: For Pete’s sake, Norville!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh! Hello, Amy – was it – I thought she
said, Mamie –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Never mind about that…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …You know what those nincompoops in the
boardroom are doing?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t call them nincom –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: They’re going to discharge eight percent of the
work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen
hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families
–</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Well yes, we’re pruning away some of the
dead wood, but if –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You mean you know about this?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Know about it? You think the Board would
do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea
from the start.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Your i –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: We have to be realistic, Amy. You know
things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes
– the fact is you’ve slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not
doing a lick of work! Why you know it’s ideas that are the lifeblood of
industry and you haven’t come up with one since the hoop and the
reason’s plain to see! You’ve forgotten what made your ideas exciting
for you in the first place – it wasn’t for the fame and the wealth and
the mindless adulation of – would you get out of here?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: …I’ve been watching you, Norville Barnes, even
though you’ve been trying to avoid me –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Now, Aim –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shutup! – and don’t think I haven’t noticed how
you’ve changed. I used to think you were a swell guy – well, to be
honest I thought you were an imbecile –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Now, Aim –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shutup! – but then I figured out you were a
swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you’re not
so slow, but you’re not so swell either and it looks like you’re an
imbecile after –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Now, Aim –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shutup! – after all! You haven’t talked to me
for a week and now I’m going to say my piece. I’ve got a prediction for
you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you’ve decided to dedicate
yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you’re going to lose all
the good things that your good ideas brought you. You’re going to throw
them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board
that wouldn’t give you the time of day if you… if you…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Worked in a watch factory?</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Huh-huh-huh!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Shutup! Exactly! Don’t you remember how you
used to feel about the hoop? You told me you were gonna bring a smile to
the hips of everyone in America, regardless of race, creed or color.
Finally there’d be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together –
even if it kept ’em apart, spacially – you know, for kids? Your words,
Norville, not mine. I used to love Norville Barnes – yes, love him! –
when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head,
but now your head is too big to be in over!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Now, Amy –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Consider this my resignation –</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Hey!!</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: …Awooooo!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – Effective immediately!!</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Hmmm… Thank you, Aloysius. This may be
useful.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Buddy… Say, buddy…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Buddy… Ya busy?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Huh-whuh?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! Say, ya
got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, uh… Buzz… Is it important?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: I like to think so! It’s this little idea I
been working on!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …Ya see, I don’t intend to be an elevator boy
forever! Take a look at this sweet baby!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …Ya get it, buddy? Incredibly convenient,
isn’t it? Ya see –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: – this is how it works, it’s these little
ridges on the side that give it its whammy! See, ya don’t have to drink
like this anymore –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: – Now you can drink like this –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: …I call it the Buzz-Sucker, get it, buddy? –
After me! Buzz! Why, people are just dyin’ for a product like this, and
the great thing is we won’t have to charge an arm and a –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …Why, this is worthless.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Huh?! But, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: This is the most idiotic thing I’ve ever
seen in my life!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Yeah, but, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Nobody wants a hare-brained product like
this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius
that made, uh…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: …say, the hula hoop such a success.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: But, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: And what do you mean barging in here and
taking up my valuable time! I’ve got a company to run here –</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: But, buddy, you were –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: – I can’t have every deadbeat on the
Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Geez, I’m sorry, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: An example must be made!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Wuddya mean, buddy?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Fired! You’re fired! Is that plain enough
for you, buster!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Awwww, buddy –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: And don’t call me buddy! Out of here!
Out!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Aw, please, sir – this job, it’s all I
got!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Get up!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: I understand if ya don’t like the Buzz-Sucker!
Just lemme keep my job, I’m prayin’ to ya!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: We don’t crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: I’m sorry, buddy… I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Buzz… off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Sorry I’m late, Sid. That back nine at
Riverdale is really murder.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Sure, sure, it’s a tough course. Well
thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place
to chat undisturbed – it seems we’re having some security problems here
at the Hud.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Ya don’t say.</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn’t bother you
with it, but – this is embarrassing, kid – it seems to concern you
directly.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: How’s that, Sid?</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: It’s not important in itself – some
elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you’d stolen the idea for
the, uh, the hoop dingus from him –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Huh?! He – no, I – he’s just – maybe I was
a little rough on the boy, ya see I –</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: Ah forget it, kid, ya don’t have to
explain to me. He’s a little person. He’s nothing. Like I say,
ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems – well, there was a
spy in the company…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Sure, sure, we tried to kill the story.
But her newspaper won’t play ball… Looks like her story’s coming
out…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …See, kid, the problem the Board’ll
have… you hired this woman. Kept her on, while she made a chump out of
you. Serious error of judgment… I mean, business is war, kid – ya take
no prisoners, ya get no second chances. And a boner like this… I’m
afraid when the Board meets, after New Year’s, your position… well, it
looks like you’re finished… stick a fork in ya, you’re done… washed
up…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …I’m sorry, kid. I understand this dolly
who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …And this elevator dope used to be a
friend, too…</p>
<p><strong>mussburger</strong>: …Well, they’ve got your throat pretty
well slit. And when you’re dead, ya stay dead. Ya don’t believe me, ask
Waring Hudsucker… Yeah, looks like curtains. Well, condolences, kid…</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You can’t print that!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: He grins wolfishly.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We are printing it! She’s hittin’ the streets
this evening –</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: – and she’s dynamite!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: But, Al, it’s the bunk! Norville showed me his
design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn’t have
invented it – look at the man – he’s an imbecile!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Archer, you’re a broken record. Fact is
Gunderson did design it – apparently he’s some kind of prodigy –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Says who?!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: You’re not the only one with sources, Amy
–</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Smith has a source on the Hud board – very
senior, very hushhush –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Yeah, and I’ll bet his initials are Sidney J.
Mussburger!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: You’ve lost it, Aim. You’ve gone soft by the
looks of it – soft on the dummy from Dubuque –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Muncie!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Whatever! It’s no dig on you, Archer, but
this story is hot and you’re no longer on top of it. Why, it’s the scoop
of the century – the other papers won’t have the Gunderson dope ‘til
tomorrow – The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they’ll be choking on
our dust come mornin’ –</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You’re fools, both of you! It’s obvious they’re
out to crucify Norville! They’re trying to destroy him!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Amy – take a break. You’ve worked hard on
this story – heck, you broke it for us! But it’s passed you by and Smith
here has taken up the slack.</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: You want slack, I’ll give you slack. You’re not
putting me out to pasture, Al, I quit! Consider this my resignation
–</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: – effective immediately!</p>
<p><strong>smitty</strong>: …Soft.</p>

I want a Martini!</p>

I’ve had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I’m not about

<p><strong>norville</strong>: Barman! Set’m up, fella!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Norville, I’m sorry, I… I tried to tell you… so
many times… It’s hard to admit when you’ve been wrong. If you could
just… find it in your heart to – to give me another chance –</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Hey! Where’s that martini?!</p>
<p><strong>amy</strong>: Just give me another chance, Norville – I can
help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can
prove it! We can –</p>

President of Hudsucker Industries is headed for the booby-hatch. Why,

cup…</p>

<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …It’s a fad.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Anyway. I hear you’ve been having,
uh…</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Been having some problems with the
board. The more things change, know what Iyayayeeeeee…</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Jesus Christopher – That smarts… Where
was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney’s been puttin’ the screws to
ya, huh, Norman?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Norville.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Mm. Well, say what you like about the
man’s ethics, he’s a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he
can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yes sir…</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Anyway. Any particular reason you didn’t
give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man’s last
words and wishes, no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize,
there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must’ve mislaid –</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: It’s sittin’ in your apron pocket, right
where you left it. Imbecile.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Oh, geez.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is
grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Geez, I –</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Ah, it’s New Year’s, I’m not gonna add to
your woes. I’m just saying.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Well, why don’t ya read it.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Yeah, go ahead. Might learn
somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: Yes sir…</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To.
Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you
read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs – an exciting
new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I
–’</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Yeah, yeah, it’s the standard resignation
boilerplate – go down to the second paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘Many years, uh… I know that you will be
wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker,
and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going
so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and
financials, sure, sure, we’re doing fine. However, Sid. These things
have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no
longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see
only an empty shell whom others call a ’success.’ How has this come to
pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations,
for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘…Looking back now, Sid, I see that I
allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams. Instead of fiercely guarding
what was timeless inside of myself, I let the hubbub of earthly commerce
erode my character, and dissolve my better self. How is it that some
manage to preserve themselves where I have failed? Sidney, I do not
know. Perhaps if others love you, you may more securely love yourself –
but I am alone. I loved a woman once, Sid, as you well know – a
beautiful, vibrant lady, an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose
you instead of I…’</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Skip this part…</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Last paragraph, last paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘…And so, Sid, the future does not belong
to such as I – nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The
future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle
against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing
in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and
my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker’s most recent employee at
the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you – you, Sid, who
have served so diligently and for so long. But –’</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: – tough titty toenails!</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …That’ll show the bastard!</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>norville</strong>: ‘…But Sid, let me urge you to work closely
with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your
energies – but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we
must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker…’</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: …Geez.</p>
<p><strong>hudsucker</strong>: Yup. It’s all there. Well, see that it
gets delivered in the morning.</p>

Carrot juice? Herbal tea?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Bromo.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: …Bromo.</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: And so began 1959. The new year…</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …And the start of a new business cycle. When

first.</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …It’s a good thing Doc Bromfenbrenner was
there…</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …‘cause he was able to keep Sidney from

<p><strong>moses</strong>: …Now Norville, he went on an’ ruled with
wisdom and compassion…</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …and started dreamin’ up them excitin’ new

<p><strong>moses</strong>: …An’ that’s the story of how Norville Barnes
climbed away up to the forty-fourth floor of the Hudsucker Buildin’…</p>
<p><strong>moses</strong>: …an’ then fell all the way down, but didn’t
quite squish hisself.</p>
