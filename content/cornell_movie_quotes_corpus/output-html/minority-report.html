<p><strong>male right</strong>: “Johnny, please. Johnny please.”</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: You’re scaring me.</p>
<p><strong>male right</strong>: I don’t like you any more, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Put the scissors down. You’re scaring me.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>male right</strong>: Oh, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Johnny! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>male right</strong>: Don’t grab at me! Let</p>
<p><strong>male left</strong>: Daddy! No!</p>
<p><strong>all three</strong>: Murderer!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why’d you let me sleep so long?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s Saturday, Johnny, you always – Why are
you staring at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m unhappy that you let me sleep so
long.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t do anything!</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: Come out of the closet on your hands and
knees.</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: Hands and knees!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: John Palmer, if you were being arrested
for any other crime, I would now read you your rights. But you are under
arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer. You have no
rights.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Thought we might a had a runner.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah, a runner.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: A little chase – that’d been good.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase
out of them.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: But only eight of us were real.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: We ever get a runner, I’d be too old to
give chase.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You’d chase. You’d love it,. Man.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I love it more Johnny boy doesn’t get to
murder his wife.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It’s a beautiful world.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesus, Paul. Your heart’s hammering. I excite
you that much?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I used to love being a cop.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re still a cop. I’m a factory worker. We
don’t catch murderers. We process them.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re the best homicide cop in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Great – except there’s no such thing as
homicide. What I do best doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<p><strong>paul.</strong>: You’re the Director of a perfect system. A
Cop with a perfect record</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: The Precogs have a perfect record. They
identify the accused – I just put on my monkey suit and go round them
up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And then I prosecute them. And they go to
jail. And lives are saved. Thousands of lives. And that’s a cop’s
dream.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: No. You’re a cop’s dream.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Who called?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No one. I called about my hair. Getting it
done this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Come on in, neighbor. Want some
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Brought these for your supper.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Oh, Frank. That’s so sweet. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Sweet, nothing. I gotta get rid of
these things. One plant, and I’m invaded by tomatoes. When I was a kid
…</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Before all this genetically engineered
crap …</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Yeah well, it’s true. It used to be
a challenge to grow things. An art. Now you put one plant in the ground
– then jump the hell out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Nah, thanks. Can’t stay. You guys
are rushing off to work anyway.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You and Ellie come for supper then.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: We’ll barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: You betcha. We’ll bring some more
tomatoes – a new batch will have grown by then.</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: Yes, Director Anderson?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Where’s Ennis Page? Why hasn’t he
delivered this morning’s Precog discs?</p>
<p><strong>intercom voice</strong>: I’ll find him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Bullying the staff again, Director
Anderson?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Was that fun for you, yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The Johnny Palmer bust?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It was okay. We got our man.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: When do we not get our man?</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: Sorry I’m late, sir. Precogs put out a heavy
national volume this morning – four for our zone.</p>
<p>****: Put the case on my desk, Ennis.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What was I thinking.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Thanks, Ennis.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Now that’s a guy who really cares.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Welcome to the main headquarters of
Precrime. Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Precrime was established in 2030, with
the harnessing of the remarkable talents of the Precognitive
mutants.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Mr. Harris, can you tell me how many
Precogs there are?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: Three. Uh, right?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: That’s exactly right! A lot of people
assume there are Precogs in every branch office.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: But there are only three Precogs, right
here in this building. And the information they give us, we send out to
all the other branches. And what is that information -what do the
Precogs do?</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: They protect us.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: That’s right, Timmy. Because of the
Precogs, you’re going to grow up murderfree. Isn’t that something?</p>
<p><strong>mr. harris</strong>: They ever wrong? The Precogs ever screw
up when they predict a murder?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Never, sir. It’s an infallible system.
The Precogs predict a homicide, and our Precrime police then apprehend
that future murderer before the event occurs. And right next door is the
Judicial Center, where we prosecute the future murderers.</p>
<p><strong>timmy</strong>: Can we see the Precogs?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: No, I’m sorry. That part of the building
is not open to the public. Now, if you’ll just step this way …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What would they think about if we unhooked
them?</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: They don’t think, sir. They just see.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: They’re not even alive, really.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Director Anderson, do you swear that the disc
you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the
future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband, John Palmer?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yes. This is the only and authentic disc
of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the
Precrime Division. This is the immutable evidence of the infallible
system.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The murder of Carol Palmer will occur … ?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: In one week – June 16th, 2040 at 10:33 in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Johnny, please –</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: “Johnny, please. Johnny please.”</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’re scaring me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t like you any more, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Put the scissors down. You’re scaring me.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Johnny! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t grab at me! Let go…</p>
<p><strong>johnny’s son</strong>: Daddy! No!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I didn’t do it. I’m innocent! It didn’t
happen!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: How does the defense plead?</p>
<p><strong>defense attorney</strong>: The defense acknowledges the
infallibility of the system. We are Guilty. We throw ourselves at the
mercy of the court.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No! No! The Precogs are wrong! No!</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Looks like the old days.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: That would be bad news for an infallible
system.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: We know it can’t be a murder – the Precogs
would’ve seen it. Why do you insist on coming to these things?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Keeps the system honest. And besides, I
like to pretend I’m a cop.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Who’s got the Coroner?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Right here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Hi DOC.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: Hello, Director Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: This a homicide, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: I’m presently analyzing
neurohormones, Assistant Director Witwer. I have not concluded my
examination.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: I’m detecting carbonization of
skull fragments around the entry wound.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Bingo. The guy put the gun to his own
head.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: I have not determined that yet,
Assistant Director.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: Please rotate the corpse to the
lateral supine position.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Can you imagine if this was a homicide? Who
even knows how to hunt down a killer any more?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I know how, dammit. You know how.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Easy, partner. But you know what I’m saying.
The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide
detectives …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: God bless the Precogs.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: This event is a negative
homicide. A mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet
self-delivered to the parietal ’portion of the skull on June 10th, 2040,
at 11:57 pm,</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: Eastern Standard Time. This
event is a positive suicide.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It’s time to stop coming to these,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah. You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: A little bit of me dies every time I come
to one of these things.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s only a party, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’d never have let them appoint me to
Precrime if I’d have known this was going to be part of it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re exactly what Precrime needed. An
amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The public loves the</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Let’s invite all these irregular assholes
over for a barbecue. Burgers and beer - think they’d come?</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: I’d come, Mr. Director. And I’d
make all the other assholes come with me.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Nice job this morning. Another
negative homicide. The Precogs never let us down.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: I have a dream, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I know you do, Senator.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Hundreds of Precogs. Not just
predicting murders, but predicting all crimes. Burglary, arson, assaults
…</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: How about jaywalking? Littering? Now
there’s a crime.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: I don’t want a police state, you
know that. But we have an opportunity here, and</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: No sir, we don’t have that opportunity.
There are only three Precogs. They’re a lucky accident of nature. There
are no more.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: We can make more. Just give me your
support. Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering
Project.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Precogs aren’t sheep or pigs. Seeing into
the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: There was only one Mozart, and there are
only three Precogs.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Fuck Mozart. The people want to be
safe. They want that more than they want food or love.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Look at us -it’s 2040 and we’ve
wrapped ourselves up in the 1950’s like a big security blanket. Why?
Because we want to feel like they felt. Safe.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Senator, a world filled with hundreds of
Precogs is not my idea of a safe place.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Sure could use your help, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I decline, Senator. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Don’t think I’ll come to your
barbecue after all.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: You don’t get out here much.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Not my sort of place.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: The head of Precrime squeamish?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: When it comes to needles and scalpels,
yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: I promise we won’t use any on you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What do you use them on?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: On bits of this and that.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What’s happening here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: We’re in an interesting phase.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What’s in the cylinders?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: Neurotissue.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: From …?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: A fusion of sources. From the Precogs’
deceased mother. From the Precogs themselves.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: A fusion of … ?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: In lay terms, we mated sperm from the
brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: And then we add mutating
variables.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: What are you doing, playing
hooky?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: It’s great out here, Frank.. You got the
touch.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: I got the arthritis, is what I
got.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Ah shit, neighbor. Goddamn Precogs
don’t miss a beat, do they? Can we do this inside? Ellie’s not home.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Sure, Frank. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: I thought I’d buried it all.
Thirty-five years – all those minutes and days to bury it. But suddenly
you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets – my God
it throws you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: He’d served his time, Frank. I know it’s
not fair. It’s way beyond not fair …</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: God damn the Precogs. You know? Why
couldn’t they have been around to save my girl? Now they’re catching
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: I really shoot the bastard, huh?
When?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Next Wednesday, at noon.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: It’s not in you, Frank, to kill
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’igrazio</strong>: Tell it to the Precogs. It’s set in
stone now, right?</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: I don’t want to be a part of this
world anymore.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I know, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’ignazio</strong>: So. Tell me, Paul. Do the Precogs
see everything?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>frank d’igrazio</strong>: Then they won’t have seen this.</p>
<p>****: We had to bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He was a future murderer.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You blame him? The guy killed his
daughter!</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah. I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in them
absolutely and I hate them absolutely. Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: And that goddamn lab trying to grow more
of them. Put a Precog in every home, you know? So we can have more
Franks - people shooting themselves – over who knows what?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Precrime did the job it was supposed to
do.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You know it. And you believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It’s not easy. It beats us down. Ellie in
there – no doubt she hates you right now.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: That’s why I got into this business – to
be hated.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: They hated us when we were regular cops. Now
we’re Precrime, and they still hate US. It’s one of the little perks of
law enforcement nobody knows about.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Let’s not do this, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Oh, Ed …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I kill you. Oh god, I kill you.</p>
<p><strong>all three</strong>: Murderer!</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Come in. Angela.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Need you to sign these. And your eleven
o’clock starts in five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: My … eleven.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Budget coordination with the FBI. You okay,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Have Page take this.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: But sir, the procedure</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I make procedure. Call him. I’m not okay,
Angela … you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>angela</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’ll speak to Witwer, put him in charge
for the rest of the day.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Breaking and entering. That’ll get you five
to ten, hard.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Take over for me today?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You sick?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Don’t give it to me. You probably have that
Trans-10 virus going around. A stomach thing. I hate stomach things.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Ed.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Run the place, okay?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Sure. Right into the ground. Go on home
before I call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with
something.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You want me to do the discs, or hold them
for you to review when you get back?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Can’t let them back up. Do ’em.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Call you later. Take it easy, all right?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Paul?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I can hardly hear you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m underground. Weakens the signal so it
can’t be picked up.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But we’re on Secure</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Listen, dammit! I’m going to murder
Ed.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Paul. Paul His crackling voice faintly comes
through the phone.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: … home.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Hello, sir.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What’s your name, officer?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: These the new Python transports?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Sorry, Officer Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Stop! Moving heats you up, makes it easier
for them to pick you up on their thermals.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s a hundred degrees in here.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I turned the furnace all the way up. Your
hair dryer. The oven. If they come, it’ll buy me twenty seconds. Maybe
thirty.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Nobody’s coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: On the phone – what you said. It’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m going to kill Ed Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You’re upset. You’ve been unhappy. There’s a
lot of pressure on you. And then Frank …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: One week from today. Tuesday, June 25, at
five-twenty in the morning. I shoot him, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You need to take time off.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You don’t have to worry about that.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I want to hold you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: If you love me, stand there. And don’t
move.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I saw the disc, Lisa. I shoot him. In the
chest. And he dies. I’ve watched a thousand murders. This time I star in
one.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Something’s wrong. You wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: The Precogs are never wrong. They emit a
single disc. “The immutable evidence of the infallible system.”</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We’ll figure this out. We’ll review the
system.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: There is no review. There’s only the disc.
It Shows My guilt. There’s no defense.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t run. Please, let’s –</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Last week. It was strange. I watched from
the bathroom window. You went out in the backyard to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: An appointment, you said. For a haircut
that afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You didn’t get your hair cut. You went to
the trouble of calling first thing in the morning. It was that important
…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Stop it! Paul, please. You’re panicking.
Everything’s going to look wrong. You’re going to distrust everybody and
everything now.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You can’t distrust me. It was Ed I called.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Ed. why outside? Why lie about it?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Stop being a cop and listen to me!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Director Anderson! There is no escape!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Your birthday’s tomorrow! We wanted to…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Drop to your hands and knees and stay there.
Precrime is entering your house!</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: He’s got a hair dryer going. Screwed up
my reading.</p>
<p><strong>officer 2</strong>: We’re not picking up shit.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Paul Anderson 0256 clear.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Enter now please, Assistant Director
Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>cia cronin</strong>: The central question is: Why does
Anderson want to kill Witwer?</p>
<p><strong>cia cronin</strong>: We checked your finances. His finances.
Nothing irregular, you don’t steal from him, he doesn’t steal from you.
You haven’t done anything that he might have discovered, and vice
versa.</p>
<p><strong>fbi swanson</strong>: Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
coups planned by you to topple him. He’s done nothing to you, or you to
him.</p>
<p><strong>vice-president almer</strong>: You fucking his wife?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fbi swanson</strong>: Okay. There we are.</p>
<p><strong>justice pollard</strong>: So, you are friends, partners, and
soul mates. Anderson has no motive.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I can’t think of one. Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD
The Precogs are mistaken?</p>
<p><strong>justice pollard</strong>: You don’t believe that, do you?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: No. The Precogs are infallible.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: You’re goddam right. So, gentlemen
-screw the motive. We got a pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty little
PR problem.</p>
<p><strong>vice-president almer</strong>: And here is our solution. You
are now Director Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>vice-president almer</strong>: Precrime must demonstrate its
willingness to go after one of its own. Total impartiality.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Now look–</p>
<p><strong>cia cronin</strong>: The public must believe that every
future murderer is pursued with equal vigor.</p>
<p><strong>fbi swanson</strong>: Therefore, Precrime will put in charge
the man best suited to the job. And who would pursue a murderer harder …
than his intended victim?</p>
<p><strong>justice pollard</strong>: You went after Anderson yesterday
-because it was right, and because you believe.</p>
<p><strong>vice-president almer</strong>: And your belief will certainly
grow stronger with each tick of the clock.</p>
<p><strong>justice pollard</strong>: Haw long will it take,
Director?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He knows Precrime, of course. And the
streets – he’s rusty, but he’ll remember how to work them. It’ll come
back to him fast. He’s … the best.</p>
<p><strong>justice pollard</strong>: We’re not here to praise Caesar –
we’re here to bury him.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He can’t avoid iris identification. Every
door he opens, every ATM he uses, or taxi or transport he boards – he’ll
get scanned. It won’t take long to find him.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: He’s been Scanned. He’s on the 33rd
Street Subway!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl. We
got him on the Subway, too!</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Why am I going to kill you,Ed?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: There’s no motive</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: My wife calling you before breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: We were planning a surprise party. It was
going to be today. Happy birthday, partner.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: This party’s no fun, Ed. It’s a hell of a
surprise, though. I’m having trouble trusting people, Ed, I gotta tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: The train makes two stops, here and here:
20th, then 33rd Street.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Split the units, go to both</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We’ll never make 20th</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You there, Ed?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I’m here. You gotta come in, Paul .</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Come in. We’ll figure this thing out
together.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It’ll get ugly if you keep running. And your
eyes, Paul – every move you make a Scanner will pinpoint you for us.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I saw a news flash. You’re the new
Director. Is that the point of this?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Didn’t think so. But it has to be
something, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Paul. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: If I come in, it puts me close to you. If
I get close … I may kill you. I can’t risk that. Anyway, they’d force
you to lock me up. And that’d be it – I’d never get my chance to solve
this thing.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You’re kinds liking this, in a way, aren’t
you? The action …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: And you get to be a real cop again. We get
to flex our muscles.</p>
<p><strong>technician 2</strong>: We have visual verification – he’s
still on the train.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: I want to tell you something,
partner. You listening?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: I gotta do this. I have to figure
this thing out. But listen to me now. If it was you running, I’d come
after you, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: You’re a cop. And I’m a future
murderer. Do your job, Ed. Come after me hard. Because, Jesus Christ, I
wouldn’t sleep or eat until I had tracked you down and put a gun to your
head.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You wouldn’t shoot a cop would you, Paul?
Paul? Paul?</p>
<p><strong>technician 1</strong>: He’s still on the line.</p>
<p><strong>voices on anderson’s phone</strong>: Police. Everyone down on
your hands and knees! Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Got a cold.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Don’t worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a
dead cat in there, and you’d never get an infection. Not with the
spectrum antibios I’ll be shooting into you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m not here for cat surgery, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: It’s all I could safely move</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah. All right.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You understand what I told you then. I can’t
just give you new irises. The Scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms
will go off.</p>
<p><strong>andersoin</strong>: I’m a cop, I know</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I gotta take your eyes out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: And put in new ones.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Yeah. I get it, DOC.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Do me quick before I run out of here.</p>
<p><strong>doc’s voice</strong>: Don’t take the bandages off for twenty
four hours. You’ll go blind if you do.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You’re in a room. I had you moved here, a
couple miles from my place. If they find you, they don’t find me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: A guy will come in, feed you once. I juiced up
the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes, ’cause I know you’re in a
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Nano-re …construction.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and
blood vessels. It’ll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. Don’t
scratch.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m giving you a bonus, might come in handy.
Feel this.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s a temporary paralytic enzyme. Someone
spots you, you duck into an alley, shoot this under your chin.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush.
You won’t look like the same man.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You tighten up again in about thirty minutes.
Hurts like nothing you ever felt. It’s vicious, but effective. I’ll put
it in your bag.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m setting up a timer. When it buzzes
tomorrow, take off your bandages, and get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m hungry, but sick to my stomach.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Guess I should eat.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: So how do we do this, pal?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: Got 27 warm bodies in this place. What
should it take, three or four Spiders?</p>
<p><strong>officer 2</strong>: Do four. Speed things up, so we can go
eat.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: It’s nice to have a little company</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: Stinking drunk.</p>
<p><strong>officer 2</strong>: Or a guy who doesn’t want to get
read.</p>
<p><strong>officer 1</strong>: Let’s eat.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: They told me to move into Paul’s office. I
said fuck you very much.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I don’t want to do any of this, Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I know. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Everybody’s got their reasons for wanting you
in charge. So do I – you won’t bring him in dead.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Yeah. But if he shoots a cop … Which is what
he does four days from now, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’d never hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I know that. But the other thing I know is –
the Precogs are never wrong.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington. Plenty of
seats in the back.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Time to upgrade your alarm system,
Senator.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Your work-up of Witwer. The Security Panel
would’ve done one. Why do I kill Witwer?</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: There’s no motive.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: There’s, always a motive.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I could’ve come to anyone on the panel.
But I picked you. Of all the shits on that panel, I like you least of
all. So if this gun goes off, I’ll feel bad, but not, you know,
devastated.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: What the fuck was I worried about?
You can’t kill me. The Precogs would’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>senator malcolm</strong>: Witwer’s clean. You’re clean.
There’s nothing. No motive. Kind of like something Kafka would’ve cooked
up. You like that, cockroach? You’re fucked and you’ll never know
why.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Tell you something about the Precogs,
Senator. They’re great on murder. But it’s the little things they fail
to see.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Little things like that, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He hasn’t shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan
in three days.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: He’s found a room – he’s going to
sit it out.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Yeah, except for holding a gun to senator
Malcolm’s goddman head in his own goddman house last night, Anderson’s
sitting it out! Why hasn’t he been scanned?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Why is he invisible? He’s moving around but
he isn’t being seen.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: He�s beating the scanners</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: No one beats the scanners.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He’s done his eyes</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: But the scarring always</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He went the whole way. The crazy bastard had
his eyes removed. New ones sewn in.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: That takes weeks to heal.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: If you’re prepared to go blind, a street
surgeon’ll juice up the repair cycle. They don’t give a fuck about
risk.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He’s going to do what it takes to stay free
– if it blinds him, maims him, or kills him.</p>
<p><strong>spokeswoman</strong>: The United States Supreme Court has
issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of
former Precrime Director Paul Anderson’s future murder of Edward Witwer,
the current Director.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: His mouth slowly opens. He steps back
against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket. He looks at
the Precog DISC in his cupped hand, then quickly puts it away.</p>
<p><strong>spokeswoman</strong>: She continues her declamation</p>
<p><strong>spokeswoman</strong>: The video you are about to see,
generated by the Precognitive mutants, is the immutable evidence of the
infallible system. Citizens are urged to call 1-800-PRECRIME with any
information that may lead us to the whereabouts of Paul Anderson, future
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Shakes his head in confusion and
disbelief. But he has the Precog disc …</p>
<p><strong>old guy</strong>: This oughtta be good, huh?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Oh, Ed …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Moves quickly through the crowds.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: “Ennis Page engages the services of
prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of
selfloathing.” Direct quote from your psychological profile – the kind
of shit I had to know as your former boss.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: “Page is an obsessive-compulsive Type
Nine.” Another quote. Niners are great for the kind of work you do –
keeping all those Precog discs in order.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: I fuck whores and I’m orderly, so what?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Something’s out of order, Ennis. Deeply
out of order.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Not A disc. The disc. When I went home
sick, I stole it.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I took it with me, Ennis. I wasn’t sick, I
was running with the evidence. So how is it that Precrime has one,
too?</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: You can’t make copies</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: It’s the basis of the system. The immutable
evidence. Copies are impossible. You went home. A little later, I came
in with a disc for Mr. Witwer to review. I wasn’t halfway out the door
when he cried out.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: He was in shock. He showed me. It was you
shooting him. Then all hell broke loose. He had to send the Precrime
units to your house.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Ennis – you gave out the same disc twice.
Less than an hour apart. The one I stole. And then another one. Of the
same event.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: It’s impossible. The Precogs can only move
forward to new events. Into the future. They never repeat.</p>
<p><strong>digital voice</strong>: Have a nice night, Mr. Symington</p>
<p><strong>young guy</strong>: Hey! Hey, you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>young guy</strong>: I’m gettin’ a cop.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Your phone will be bugged. So we can’t
meet, we can’t do anything. Just listen. Nowing you’re listening is
enough.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: When Precrime stormed the house, I thought
you’d called them. Betrayed me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I know. Witwer sent them. He saw the disc
and had to do his job. Tell me you forgive me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Of course, I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: All these people I need to forgive me. Do
you think Frank forgave me? All I could do for him was send him
gardenias. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Frank hated gardenias.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands and
knees!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands and
knees!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Lower your weapon, or we will neutralize your
threat potential.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Do not move!</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Pick one for me!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Point to the train I should take.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Don’t kill me! Jesus. Please.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: But the Precogs would’ve predicted me
killing you. You’d know whether I do or not.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: They shut down the system. Haven’t they?
They’ve shut down the Precogs.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: They’re off homicides. They’re redirecting
them to help us locate you.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You all right in there?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Welcome to the main headquarters of
Precrime. Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United
States.</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: Are you … all right, Mr. Symington?</p>
<p><strong>tour guide</strong>: We’ll wait right here for you, sir!</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Must be a glitch …</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Anderson just got IdentiScanned.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It’s him – he’s been scanned.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: But he’s had his eyes done. Right? Sir?
Tries to think it through.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: He had to have.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Jesus Christ, sir. He’s in the basement
of this building.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: Standing orders from the Security
Panel, sir.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: If he wants to get to me, he’ll get to
me.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: No, he won’t, sir.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Don’t worry, air -emergency generators
will kick on in five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Explanation, please!</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Uh, sir. It seems … he got the
generators, too.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Save us, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Save us.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You let me get here, didn’t you? You
stopped giving them information, so they couldn’t track me.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Save –</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Help me, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: They’re blue.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And now they’re brown.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Why didn’t the Precogs know he was coming to
do this?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The next time he shows up it’ll be to kill
me.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: We won’t let that happen,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You won’t, huh?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: When can we get these things
operational?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: They’re a hive mind, sir. It takes three
for their predictive abilities to be fully operational.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: These two are all I have to find the man who
is about to murder me. Hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind
of fucking chemicals you have to. They are a machine, and I need that
machine at my disposal.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis. I could just
walk in here.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: I forgot. To turn it on.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You don’t look surprised to see me.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: He took one of my babies.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s desperate, Ennis. He had to. We have to
help him.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: It’s a fake Ennis.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This is the first disc. You delivered it to
Director Anderson. He reviewed it. And then he stole it, and went on the
run.</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: I delivered … a fake .. to him?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But he thought it was real, and ran with
it.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: An hour later, you delivered a second disc of
the same event. Witwer reviewed it. It was real. How do I know this?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Director Anderson had his eyes changed. They
were blue. Now he has brown ones.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: This disc, the fake one, shows a blueeyed
Anderson murdering Witwer two days from now. He doesn’t have blue eyes
anymore. The person who faked this disc had no idea he would change his
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Listen! But the second disc has to be real,
because he has brown eyes when he murders Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Somebody tried to frame him with a fake. And
somehow it all became real. Why, Ennis? How could this happen?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You handle the discs. How did a fake one get
delivered?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You want– ?</p>
<p><strong>page</strong>: He spilled coffee everywhere … Everywhere
…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: What coffee? What are you – ?</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: My brothers aren’t here.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You didn’t even look around. You knew.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: We can sense each other. You must save</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Stop. I saved You. It was the best I could
do.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Thank you, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What am I going to do with you?</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Name me, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Give me a name. I’ve never had one.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Listen to me. Listen to me … Rose.</p>
<p><strong>female</strong>: Rose.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. They shifted your precognition so
you would locate me.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Yes. And it hurt us, physically. Did you know
that? The helmets, the controls. It hurts.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: When they shifted you to find me, you
didn’t reveal everything. That I was going to break into Precrime.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We saw our chance. You would need to shut us
down, you would have to come. We wanted you to come.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You used me – to save you.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I have been used all my life, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No one cared that we were human. From a human
mother. Taken at birth. Hooked to machines. We have been alive,
Anderson. Enslaved, for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: But now I have a name. And I know the man who
has named - me will not allow me to be enslaved again.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. What’s going to happen to us? Can
you see that?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I’m weak. And away from my brothers. I see
glimpses and hints of things nearby. But it’s all … scattered. I’m tired
of the future, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You didn’t know I was going to do that,
did you?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. Oh, Anderson. It was lovely.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: Who else could it’ve been?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: He grabbed a Precog so he could
commit an undetected murder.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Page worshipped the system. He fell apart.
Shot himself.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: Director Witwer. This event is a
positive homicide.</p>
<p><strong>holographic doctor</strong>: A mortal wound was generated by
a .38 calibre bullet delivered to the left occipital portion of the
anterior skull, on June 16th, 2040, at 1:24 am, Eastern Standard Time. A
Phase Two Investigation is in order.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The one on the left, the first disc -it’s a
fake. He doesn’t have blue eyes anymore.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: A fake.</p>
<p>****: But the Precogs predict the infallible truth. They don’t emit
fake discs.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Exactly. You can’t tamper with the Precogs,
induce them to make fakes</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: But that doesn’t mean someone couldn’t have
made a fake disc on their own and inserted it into the delivery
system.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in
with that day’s real ones…</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: We’re all programmed to believe anything we
see on a Precog disc. The system has never been wrong …</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: You have to call off the hunt. He was set
up.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: It’s gone too far, Lisa She shakes her head,
shocked at his response</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He was set up! You both were. If Paul kills
you, you’re both out of the picture.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Who wants us out? Of what picture?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing! And then we can
investigate Witwer’s mouth opens and closes. He tries again.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Ennis Page was murdered last night.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Everything points to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He’s not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I think he is. A murderer … and a future
murderer. Lisa. What does it matter that the first disc is a fake … if
the second one’s real?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. Listen to me. I’m going to leave you
here. I have to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: No. You must save my brothers.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: It’s impossible. There’s no time. I’ve
done what I can do!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Come here, Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Do you see that boy in the blue hat walking
with his mother? In sixty seconds he will walk beneath those workers
installing a window on the tenth floor of that building.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: They’ll drop the window, killing him. It is
impossible to save him.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: It was impossible to save that boy – but you
did, Anderson. It’s in you. It’s what you are.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You knew it wasn’t impossible. That I’d
get there.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You are a man who saves others. Save my
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m in a lot of trouble right now.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: My brothers are in more trouble. They’ve moved
them to … an awful place.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. Ed Witwer -he’s in the most trouble
of all. Who saves him?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: We’re not really set up for this type
of</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. Try to drink.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Your wife. We have to get her here,
Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I don’t know …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: What are you seeing?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Glimpses, Anderson. Please. We have to get her
here.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You’re scaring me, Rose</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Stop talking. It uses me up.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: In three minutes your wife will take a walk
..</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Sir? I’m sorry, she stepped out for a few
minutes. Sir?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: I need you.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: It’s 1:03. Set your watch,
exactly.</p>
<p><strong>anderson’s voice</strong>: This is what you have to do …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: At 1:07 hang up the phone and enter the
Lawrence Museum.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: At 1:13 the two Precrime officers
following you take a wrong turn into a different room, losing sight of
you for ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: An undercover transport officer will have
received emergency orders to follow you.</p>
<p>****: He’s wearing a red tie. He has short blond hair.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: As you come around the bend, cry out and
turn around and slap the officer…</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Stay on Ninth street. Underneath Ninth
street is the main power feed for The Sprawl. It’ll mess up the
navigational beacon on the hovercraft. Keep switching taxis. But stay on
Ninth.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Two hundred dollars if you don’t scan me.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: The hovercraft will try to drop altitude,
but the air traffic will slow it down. Precrime loses you. You’ll have
to walk two miles. Don’t get scanned.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You bite me, bitch, I’ll pull your teeth
out.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Cut it a little close there, honeybunch.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose got the street wrong. She’s getting
weak.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Rose?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Two discs. One fake. One real.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: I don’t think there were supposed to be two.
Whoever planned it, wasn’t counting on two.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: An infallible system. Every disc ever
generated has been true …</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Somebody wants you out of the way – so they
make a fake disc. Who ever doubts the discs?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I never doubted it. I saw it. And believed
it, absolutely. I was certain I was going to murder Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I saw the fake, and believed so much in
the system, that I saw myself as a murderer. And the Precogs picked up
those thoughts …</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: And generated the second disc. The real
one.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: A self-fulfilling prophesy. I believed it
was true. And that made it true.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. If all this is based on a lie -the
fake disc – then do I really kill Witwer?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We see what we see. I’m sorry, Anderson. It’s
been predicted.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: We can’t take chances, sir</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: It happens in less than three
hours. We put you in a hovercraft and keep you airborne – until after
the event.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The event.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: I’ve been ordered to get you onto
the craft. By force if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The Precogs are never wrong. The event will
take place. I’m a believer. Aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant glaser</strong>: I don’t leave this room without
you, sir. The Security Panel insists.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis
Page Lisa shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: He was the weak link in the perfect
system.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Obsessive compulsive niners can’t allow
changes in the routine</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Something threw him off. He tried to tell me.
It didn’t make any sense. Something about “spilled coffee.” Someone was
in his office with him. And coffee spilled …</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We were always treated as if we weren’t alive.
As if we weren’t there.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Even now. You forget that I’m here. You talk
between yourselves. And when you need me to see into the future, then
you turn to me.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: We weren’t just lost in the future. We were in
the Chamber, too. Our eyes were open. In the present.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Your eyes were open. What did you see,
Rose?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Who would I have told? Who ever talked to us?
Who cared that we could talk?</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose. Who spilled the coffee? Straight
ahead …</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Ed Witwer entered Page’s office.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Page was so upset at the sight of the
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket, reached
over Page and put it in one of the open cases.</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: I didn’t understand what I’d seen. And I had
no one to tell …</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Ed …</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: The perfect system -brought down by a cup of
coffee. My god.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: He set into motion his own death. He
didn’t know it would go this far. What makes me leave this room? If I
stay here I won’t kill him. Right?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You see, if you think you can put me on a
hovercraft and save me, then you don’t believe in the infallibility of
the Precog system.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: And what I do not want around me, are
nonbelievers.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Things quiet?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Sir. Should you … be here?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: There’s been a development. A body’s been
found in the Sprawl.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Anderson’s?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: They’re checking it out. I need to see what
the Precogs have seen.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Borrowed this from the technicians’ lounge.
You don’t think they’ll mind, do you?</p>
<p><strong>dr.resfield</strong>: You shouldn’t be here, Director.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: No, no. This is exactly where I should
be.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: You’re under a lot of strain,
Director.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: And tv’s so good for that – soothes the
mind.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Bring me up to speed, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: We’re getting nothing from them.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: And that’s because … ?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Do you think they know where Anderson
is?</p>
<p><strong>dr. resfield</strong>: It’s impossible to tell. We’ve done
everything. Maybe even too much.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: They know how to find Anderson for me.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: They’re the perfect machine, Doctor. You
just have to know which button to push.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: Come on, Rose.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: One hour. We hold it together for an hour,
Witwer lives – and I’m not a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: She won’t last an hour.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Rose!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: He’s killed him, Anderson!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: You didn’t save my brother.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Did he kill both of them, Rose? Rose!</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: Does it matter, Anderson?</p>
<p><strong>lisa</strong>: If you leave this room…</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Then I’m a cop, just trying to do
hisjob.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Is he coming? No? Yes? Maybe? I think
yes.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: And you think yes.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Infallibly, immutably yes.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I figured, since I can see the future, too,
maybe I could get a little disc action going. Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You find you been doing that a lot this
week? Looking at clocks? Three minutes to go.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: There’s never anything good on, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: There. That’s the old Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You’re not the old Ed. You’ve lost it.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You lost it. You went weak in the knees,
partner.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: I’m not your partner.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The air went out of you when Frank D’Ignazio
killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: He was guilty. I accepted that.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: No you didn’t. The doubts were creeping in
on you. The lab trying to engineer more Precogs … Malcolm pressuring you
to expand …</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Belief is the basis of the system. It was
your job to be the ultimate believer.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: And when Frank died, you faltered. I’m a
cop, I see into the hearts of men. And the thing about you is, you
wouldn’t have just walked away.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Never been my style.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Precrime needs to grow. You would have stood
in its way. The Security Panel wouldn’t have understood that. What
you’re capable of. What a bulldog you are. Look what you’ve been doing
to us all week. Amazing. You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: So you took matters into your own
hands.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I understood the threat. I understood</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You killed a Precog. You ended the system
you wanted to protect.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Wrong. This lab will make more. Believe it,
Paul.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Knowing the exact moment of your death
-it’s made you crazy, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You didn’t bring your gun!</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: That’s right. No gun.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You see?! That’s exactly what I’m talking
about. You don’t Believe!</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: The system is infallible.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: I guess that’s why I’ve always carried
two.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: You can’t have it both ways. You don’t
want to die. That’s why you lured me here – to kill me first.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: But it you don’t diet the system is
flawed, and you couldn’t live with that.</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Pick it up</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: You’re killing him, partner.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Let’s not do this, Ed Witwer trains his
gun on Anderson. Anderson trains his gun on Witwer.</p>
<p><strong>anderson</strong>: Oh, Ed …</p>
<p><strong>witwer</strong>: Now do you believe?</p>
<p><strong>rose</strong>: James. Can you guess what I’m thinking?</p>
